because we are covering it in the second

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
part

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
apache local communities group of uh

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
local apache

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
and open source enthusiast people uh who

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
work on

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
spreading the apache awareness uh and

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,319
the apache

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,599
awareness in their local uh area

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,599
so uh i will cover it more in detail

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,040
uh in further slide so this session is

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,560
about how you can share

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,239
your idea and uh it will be flourished

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
inside the apache

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,400
so then we have the next discussion on

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,480
then we uh have the next main thread in

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,599
the 1st of august in 2019

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,120
and then in 19th november uh we have

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,319
another thread on this

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,879
and in 4th of december we have one more

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
thread

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
so these are the basically the main

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,959
threads where the

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,440
uh apache local community idea was

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
getting

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,159
shaped and the people were involving and

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,200
we were building the uh

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,480
the framework for it

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
uh so uh if you talk about digit in the

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
numbers

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
the initial idea and the alc initiative

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
model

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
and all the governance which you you

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040
will be seeing

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,360
today was discussed and finalized in

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
about 160 emails and around 49 people

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
for

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,400
involved in this discussion and 12

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,599
different topics were discussed

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
and which gives the birth to uh alc

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,359
which it is currently right now

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,120
which is looks so if we can say uh

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,360
these are the discussion which give

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,479
birth to the current state of apostle

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,520
local community initiative

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,720
uh talking about some statistics uh from

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,000
its inception to today uh there are

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,240
uh 536 emails sent as of today and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,880
we had around 100 participants

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,680
discussing the 53 different topics uh

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,520
related to apache local community on the

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,479
mailing list

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
uh this is just a graph of how the uh

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,080
daily email states shown

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
uh from the inception to today uh about

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,800
the

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,160
alc topic on the dave list

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,600
now uh what uh is the process

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,240
means we come up with the idea of

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
let's build some kind of local community

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,120
and then it taking shape and now it's

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,880
become huge

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
so how this happened so i have my

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,639
experience of it and i

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,919
would like to know uh i decoded the

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,440
process around it

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,440
uh which may help you to share your idea

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,039
inside the apache it could be anything

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
it could be related to the project

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
or new project or new initiative or

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
improvement in in the existing

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
initiative

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,320
so how you can present it and how can

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,800
it can take shape so this is the process

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,680
which

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,840
i figured out uh while uh having the

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
apache local community initiative

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,680
uh so i thought to share it it might

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
helpful for you as well

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
so uh first you have an idea that's

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
great thing

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
now define and document it defined as

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,560
scope uh

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,759
think in all the direction of what this

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,960
idea uh

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
can be uh uh when when we are going to

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,720
execute this idea what are the different

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,759
things which can be done

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
and defined them and more importantly

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,880
document them so there are the

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
confluence

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,199
uh available the wiki for uh

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,639
every project uh same for the community

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
development project as well

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,000
uh you can document it there initially

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,400
you can have your

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,919
your word document and then you can put

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,440
it into the conference

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
and then you can share it with the

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,800
community oh this is some idea

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
i have come in the mind and this is a

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,919
document something

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
uh please have a look share your kind

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,479
inputs so the great thing about

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,680
apache community is they will not

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,080
disappoint you

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
they will see the idea and i'm pretty

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
sure

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,880
they will come up with you the feedback

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,039
and

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
then you can take it from there further

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,120
one important thing which i figure out

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
is

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
if you have an idea it's it will be good

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,960
to have some kind of

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
a live example for it for example when

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,319
we were doing the

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,599
apache local community initiative the

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,240
apache local community

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,720
indoor chapter was the first kind of poc

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
uh

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
you can set it as an example how it will

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,520
work

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,479
so if your idea can replicate in some

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,120
kind of example

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
it will be really good to have so that

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
people get

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
first and experience how it will look

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
like then

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,759
uh work on the feedback because when you

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,680
share something on the mailing list

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:33,199
there will be uh some feedback to you

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,240
obviously some some feedbacks

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,360
are are easily doable some feedbacks

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
will take time but

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,039
important is to work on the feedback and

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
acknowledge the respective

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
person who gives you the feedback

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,120
remember the point important here is to

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,599
have the constructive communication

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,199
if you say if you share some idea there

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
could be some response it's not

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,400
necessary that someone want to

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,639
criticize you it's just uh they are

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
saying something in some point of view

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
uh and

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,440
since they are having more experience or

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,639
many of the people from the apache

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
community which are having

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,919
very great experience uh they have more

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
uh

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,400
knowledge and experience uh what bad or

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,319
good could be so they may share you okay

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
there's a problem in this idea

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,000
so don't take it as a uh is like that

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,240
someone is criticizing you

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,039
it's really a great opportunity to

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
improve

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,360
your idea and improve the things which

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
are which is in your mind

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
so important thing is always work on the

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,560
feedback and have a constructive

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
communication

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,240
if you go on the uh dave list nc's

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,440
archive

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,519
uh initial discussion uh uh

there there was a mail thread which is

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,360
having around more than uh

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,560
39 plus mail uh on that

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,880
so it's just continuous feedback then uh

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
then something was uh then after

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,440
feedback then

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
more feedback and finally the things

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
which comes is the

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
uh you can see the apache local

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,360
community one of the beautiful thing

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,680
uh we have in the community so this is

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
because of the great feedbacks from the

great

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240
people in the apache software foundation

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,200

and we'll give you the platform to

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,480
finish the idea

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,760
so this was about the process which i

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,959
have decoded

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,640
uh now let's uh move to the second part

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
of the session which is

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
apache local community introduction the

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
present is straight and what's our next

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
one and what we are planning to do in

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,000
the future

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,640
uh introduction uh apache local

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
community

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
is from apache local community and it's

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
a calm day

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,760
initiative it's a project of apache

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
apache community development uh it is

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,560
the initiative by

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,839
uh calm dev and what alc is

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,360
is is basically a local group of people

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,680
uh apache people open source enthusiasts

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
which is called as a elc chapter so they

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,839
are responsible for

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
uh spreading the awareness of apache in

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
their local region

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
so if you if you heard about the google

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,320
developer group or facebook developer

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,440
circle

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
or mozilla also have some local

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
community

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,959
mozilla representative so this is a

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,399
kind of something like that local group

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,240
which we have for the

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:33,680
apache foundation

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,760
uh this is one of my favorite slide uh

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,120
for two reason uh one is the beautiful

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,399
logo which you can see

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,880
is uh designed by the uh created we met

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,920
apache and very special thank you candid

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,240
who designed this logo and second reason

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,560
to

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,839
uh my favorite slide is how we establish

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,160
the new alc and

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
their their duration when they establish

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,079
so the first afc

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
chapter which uh we will be established

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,040
was

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
the alc indoor which uh in the august

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,959
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
then in the february 2020 we have the

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,519
beijing chapter

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,519
uh then in march we have warsaw poland

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,120
uh a chapter and then the budapest

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,920
chapter in in april

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
uh 2020 so uh indoor is from uh yeah

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
indoor

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,680
chapter is from india beijing is from

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
the china warsaw is from

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,040
uh uh the poland and budapest from the

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
hungary

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,200
so you can see the global presence of

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,519
the apache local community

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
uh now let's come about what's the rules

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,959
and responsibility of

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
apache local community chapter what what

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,200
what we

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,360
are doing and what is the role of alc

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
the first and the very common goal we

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,680
all have is the spreading the awareness

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,720
of apache in the local community

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,279
so uh it's it's our core goal

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
uh what for that what we do is we host

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,440
various

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,760
event for the local uh open source

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,480
and just people which includes uh

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,240
student developers business community

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,760
anyone who are interested in the open

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
source and there

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,240
we share about the apache software

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,480
foundation and the apache way

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
and the various apache projects we are

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
having because

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,880
there are tons of buzzer projects we are

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
having in the wider category ranging

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,399
from big data to iot

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,720
uh to community community to erp

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,000
so we share this information among the

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
local group every

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
chapter when they have session they uh

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,639
discuss about it

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,839
and uh we bring uh the project user

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,880
and the developer together uh uh in in

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,000
we try to do that uh through lc uh

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,160
initiative what's the benefit of alc

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,079
it's the next question we uh we had in

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,800
our mind and as a community we

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,279
bring a storm on this and uh we come to

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,959
know

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:52,240
uh as you can see uh if we having

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
uh the local community of the apache

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
people

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,880
we have the open the doors for more

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,760
frequent and the small events

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,959
means uh you can you know right we have

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,240
apache on

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,959
uh uh maybe two uh twice in a year

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,360
in different location then we have a

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,079
apache road so again which is having

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,839
around count of four or three uh

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,440
depending on which year we are doing it

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,000
so uh then if we want to have some new

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
end

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,399
uh the frequency uh uh if you want to

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,480
increase the frequency it will be good

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,680
to have the smaller events through alc

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,880
chapters

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,760
uh and uh it will provide the platform

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,079
from the

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,000
various project people come under one

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,880
roof for example uh uh

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,320
we have some alc in the beijing uh there

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,959
are the people from

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,279
various uh different project they come

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,120
under the one group and can discuss so

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,199
uh they can share their thoughts

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
knowledge and idea so that's good thing

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,920
about you can have the different project

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,040
from the uh the people from the

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,160
different project

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,279
and it helps us in building the uh

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,959
uh expanding our community and as we say

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,760
it's a community over

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
code so this is the direct benefit we

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
got

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,040
from our uh alc initiative under the uh

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,760
asap

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
so you must be wondering okay now how

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,519
a community mailing list uh itself right

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
uh but yeah these are the uh two

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
important things to be taken care

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,920
of while establishing the alc we should

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,160
have at least one asf member plus two

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,720
pmc members

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,600
the process is very simple we are having

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,399
uh

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,079
in the establishing the aoc chapter uh

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,000
remember this all process

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,000
or the governance architecture which we

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
have defined is come from the

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,839
thorough inputs and the brain is

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,880
stopping uh from the community

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,480
which we uh which we have uh in in the

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
early stage of alc where

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
most of the feedback come from the

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,199
community and be able to establish this

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,959
process

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
so once you send the mail on the dave

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,279
list some pmc member will pick up

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,320
this mail and start a discussion on the

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,160
private list

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
and based on then they will have the

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,199
vote and discussion

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,600
and based on this uh the uh

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,560
approval on the alc chapter will be

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,680
there or

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,360
and then once it is approved uh alc

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,839
the pmc member of the com dev project

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
will create some space for you in the

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
confluence

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,920
under our comedy wiki because there are

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,600
various documents which you need to

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,440
maintain when you become the part of

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,680
apache local community chapter

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
uh like you need to submit your reports

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,520
to uh

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,919
you have to edit your uh events details

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,640
so that's why we create a space for you

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,400
and then we share the edit rights with

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,600
all the members of that particular

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,520
uh lc chapters member because uh when

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,880
someone post uh hey i want to establish

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,360
the uh alc

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
uh chapter in this local region uh there

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,120
are various uh

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,039
chances that other another people from

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
same local region also get interested

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
and this is how your llc chapter is

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,400
built

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,640
then once this is uh approved uh from

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
the pmc we do a formal announcement on

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
the announce list and

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
also keep the dev list in the cc so uh

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
they were

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,039
people also know we have announced it

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,360
officially

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,720
now uh this was the process of

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
establishing the anc

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
now what if we want to dissolve the

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
analysis chapter

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,720
the reason is uh why we want to dissolve

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,520
any chapter there could be any reason

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,760
maybe the people of the alc chapter are

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
not no longer interested in in the

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,360
activity

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
or if they are inactive for more than

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,120
three months so

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,520
we uh contact them personally uh

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,160
all the members of alc chapter and we

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,480
ask them

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
hey is everything okay or you need some

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
help from our side

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,640
what's the reason and if still they are

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,760
no longer interested in participating

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,600
in the asc initiative or the activity uh

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,360
we have a thread uh we for encounter pmc

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,640
and vote and we dissolve the

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,400
uh actor because it is uh the reason

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
behind it is because we strictly have

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,280
one lc per town and city

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,799
that's why we uh we do that

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,120
if some uh uh is not active we had to

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,919
dissolve it so that new people can came

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,679
out and and

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,559
established uh the new year's chapters

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
guidelines to organize an and any event

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,320
basically

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,360
uh uh see uh

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,600
we have uh in future we are having uh

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,480
various alt chapters so uh it's

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,520
important to have

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
oversight and we make sure the message

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,840
which

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,000
which we are communicating through

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,799
apache local community chapters

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
is in line with the what is our motto is

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,200
about software foundation

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,799
so the messaging should be right so uh

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
we have defined these guidelines so

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,760
whenever any alc chapter of any city

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
want to organize any kind of event so

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,480
what they've done

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,720
is they have a detailed uh agenda or

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,280
prepare the document in the conference

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
which we have created this space

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
for the chapter and then they send a

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
list to the calm day

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,280
and after the approval from any of the

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,760
pmc combat pmc member

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,080
uh the chapter executed the event and

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,000
after successful uh executing the event

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,480
we have this some post event report that

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,480
how many people participate in the event

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,720
or some highlights which you would like

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,160
to share some photographs whatever you

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
would like to share in the post event

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,919
report

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
and then there's a space in every asg

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,400
chapter

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,679
what are the past events and what are

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,760
the upcoming events so

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,520
this is also maintained uh in the

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,400
conference itself

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,120
so this is how we uh a general any of

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
the event

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,240
is uh uh organized in dlc so the process

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
simple you just document it

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
share with the calm dev uh pmc member

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,000
approve it and then you execute it and

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,080
share the post event report

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
so this this is as simple as this and

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,559
you can understand why it is required

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
because we

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,799
we don't want to uh uh give any wrong

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,799
messaging through

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,159
any of the elc chapters so this will

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,799
help us in the

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
making sure we all are in line and we

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,640
are moving towards one direction

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,799
as for the messaging is concerned

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,600
okay the roles and responsibility in

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,880
managing the ah initiative

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,799
so uh you can see it's it's a full-blown

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
initiative and we have the various

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,919

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,559
so

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,159
the first role is we have the alc chair

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,360
so as you know

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:07,600
uh uh we have uh

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,799
so uh the alc chair make sure uh the

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
quarterly reports are filed by all the

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,360

mentor and guide new llc

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
for example whenever a new elc

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,600
established we assign a mentor to them

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,480
and then we work with them generally

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,039
conducted by any elc chapter then

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,520
submitting the comedy

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,320
report quarterly report to the comm day

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,080
and uh

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,000
making sure the check directorate which

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,679
activities are in line with the alc

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
rules and responsibility which we have

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,799
just discussed in the previous slide

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,520
and he or she is the single point of

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:46,080
contact for the respective alc chapter

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,559
so uh whenever uh uh somebody wants to

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,600
contact any elc chapter they directly

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,080
can contact to the chapter lead

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,360
uh then we have the chapter members so

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,360
every chapter have

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,400
more members who are actually the ground

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,760
level heroes

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,159
and participating in the planning of the

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,440
went

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,760
executing it at the ground level so uh

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,600
they they make sure we all are following

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,000
uh that particular chapter is following

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,559
the

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,279
code of conduct and the events are

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,279
organizing

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,880
organizers for the guidelines and the

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,760
help in preparing the reports

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,679
and we have various uh pages in the

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,919
conference for every chapter like their

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,159
reports their even details

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,520
and and their future events their past

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,480
events so they make sure

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,400
this uh wiki is up to date all the time

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
and we have various resources uh like

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,799
presentation

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,760
uh and other stuff so uh for

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,720
in the uh lc resources uh the logos and

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,440
all that stuff so

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
uh uh the chapter members also make sure

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
that this resources are

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,520
always up to date for for everybody in

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,760
the community

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,679
uh so there are some guidelines to

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,120
managing the elc chapter so some common

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,679
requirement may come that

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,919
uh if when the alc chapter is

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,200
established there was

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,559
some members for example 10 and now or 5

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,640
it could be any number

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,159
now a new member want to join the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,640
chapter so what's the process

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
the process is simple uh the chapter

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,120
lead

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,400
initiate a mail on the comm day

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,520
private list uh keeping that into the cc

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,279
and into uh it uh have the all the

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,159
existing chapter members

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,640
so inviting a new chapter member is in

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,520
the

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
control of existing chapter members of

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,240
that particular

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,679
alc chapter so uh it will send the mail

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,840
to all the

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,880
alc chapter members and having the

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,919
private list

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,480
private comm dev listing cc because just

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,320
the pmc know okay there are uh some new

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,960
member is going to join in the

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,360
in the uh this particular agency chapter

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,559
so

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,000
it's just for information purpose uh

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,320
uh then when the voting is gone uh

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,320
on there and vote is done by the

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,720
particular alc chapter members

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,480
and then if we have more votes in the

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,279
favor definitely they invite

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,559
the new member to the chapter and now if

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,600
somebody wants to

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,720
uh uh leave their chapter lead

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,760
a position error and want to and or any

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,200
community uh

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,880
lc local community uh uh

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,799
chapter one to change the chapter lead

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,520
so the process again simple

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,240
they start in a mail on the private list

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,520
again the

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,400
uh on into all the respective chapter

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,880
members are there

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,760
and in cc we have the private list so

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,520
again the

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,440
voting is done for the changing chapter

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,240
lead and the vote is done by the alc

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,200
chapter members itself and based on what

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,720
the new chapter

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,240
lead is decided so uh this is how we uh

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:54,159
have the new chapter uh uh lead for the

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,320
a uh asd uh the journey so far it's

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,279
it's it's really been a great journey

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,880
because uh

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,960
uh we have been successfully able to

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
establish the framework and the

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,760
governance model for the alc

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,679
which is our huge achievement and the

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,520
whole credit score to the apache

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,320
community uh the great inputs from there

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,640
uh make sure we uh we build up this

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,120
framework and

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,080
this is how it goes as of now currently

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,120
we as i discussed we have four alc

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,640
ah we had more than 20 plus events which

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,080
includes the physical meter

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,880
virtual meetups webinar podcast and

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,360
uh code workshop at the university where

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,240
we

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,159
uh where actually the university student

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,120
uh contribute to many of the apache

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,840
projects

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,200
to their pages and we also have some

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,480
translation work uh

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,840
uh done uh in the done by the

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,039
uh local community uh uh i'm not

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,440
mentioned it here uh

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,720
yeah i missed it oh i mentioned it's asf

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
content translation which is the next

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,880
topic

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,799
so uh alc beijing has done great job and

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,159
translating some of the content to do

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,120
mandarin language

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,679
uh so this is the activities done by the

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,559
uh

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
some of the activity by the uh chapter

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,679
uh

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,840
for the record which uh have the number

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,240
of participants in our events we have

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,559
reached around 700 plus direct audience

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
through four alcs so this is number

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,559
where we have the participant count

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,240
but the resources which we have created

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,440
like podcast webinar

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,320
are having some content translation uh

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,960
we don't know

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,480
how through that uh village how much

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
audience so definitely the number is

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,240
more than 700

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,960
but the 700 is the direct audience which

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,000
we know

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,279
we have reached in this past uh time

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,720
of the alc through four alc chapters uh

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,919
the great thing about is uh

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,760
in spite of the uh kobe 19 uh

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,120
the first idea was to have the physical

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,240
meet up so before

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,559
we have physical media then the uh

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,279
then the asc chapters bring some more

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,760
creative ideas and have virtual meetups

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,840
have podcasts some webinars and

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,440
virtually we translated our

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,240
uh uh our uh activities in the alc

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,559
uh versa elc warsaw uh

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,679
possible and thanks so much for this

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,799
isaac thank you so much you are

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,399
participating in the

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,200
initial discussions thank you so much uh

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,240
so we got a question from uh tomic will

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,039
also always be

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
only city related no basically it's uh

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,640
uh

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,840
it's a local region uh it's uh uh

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,919
if we have an uh metropolitan city like

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,960
san francisco so there could be some

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,559
chances that

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,679
we could have two separate uh alc there

00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,640
but it's about the local region uh so

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,000
if the local region is really big and

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,159
can be divided into more

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,679
smaller local region there could be the

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,520
chances we could have

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,720
the uh sub local communities but again

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,839
it's uh uh

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,440
uh it's a case to case basis

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,159
most of the time uh it will be a city

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,079
specific

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,079
but yeah if the city is really very

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,040
large and uh

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,679
so in that case for metro metropolitan

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,399
region

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,200
we will have we can have the smaller uh

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,560
sub

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:37,679
uh alc chapters yeah thank you so

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,720
uh we have uh five more minutes

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,839
uh so if you have any questions uh

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,599
please feel free to post here uh

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,480
so it may be possible that a smaller

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,679
country will have only one chapter uh

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,399
uh so atomic if you talk about the

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,200
countries

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,560
it's again it's a country is really a

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,560
big thing right

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,760
so uh it's uh in my experience

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,320
there are very less chances to have

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,400
one alc for the for the country uh

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,400
because uh

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,520
uh if it is country itself it's a big

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,280
thing so

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,280
uh uh so uh for the for you to answer

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,320
your question related country uh

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,839
definitely uh uh i'm as for my

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,160
experience will not go for

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,200
uh having one lc for the whole country

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,599
because uh

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,359
uh it's about the local meetup and the

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,280
country is big somebody from one

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,720
location to another location or in the

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,839
two different position

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,119
may not be made physically uh so because

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,800
it's a local meetup

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,640
and yeah due to it we are doing it

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,040
online and virtual but yeah

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,880
in real it will be the physical beta so

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,640
chances are really

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,640
rare and very very very very less for

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,040
having a one chapter for the whole

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,040
country

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,560
nice

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,079
