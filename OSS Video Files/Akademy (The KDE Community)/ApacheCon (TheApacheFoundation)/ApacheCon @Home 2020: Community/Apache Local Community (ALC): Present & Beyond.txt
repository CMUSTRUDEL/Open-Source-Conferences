Apache Local Community (ALC) is an initiative by the Apache Community Development project. ALC comprises local groups of Apache (Open Source) enthusiasts, called an 'ALC Chapter'. For details please refer https://s.apache.org/alc The session will be majorly on two topics: #1.) How the Apache Software Foundation provides the opportunity to flourish your idea. I shared the initial ALC idea to the community around mid-2019, from there with the great inputs from the community and mentors, we have given the shape to the idea. It is a great example, how the community can help you to transform and enhance your idea to match global standards. #2.)
