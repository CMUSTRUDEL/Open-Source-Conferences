In this talk we'll talk about the research efforts the D&I committee has been working on for the past year. We'll talk with our researchers and will deep dive into the insights and results we obtained from the three phases of our work: The ASF Community Survey, the D&I research interviews and our quantitative analysis with Bitergia's technology. We'll also have an opportunity to ask questions to the researchers and the team behind this effort.
