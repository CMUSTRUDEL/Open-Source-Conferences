	Apache Pulsar: a borderless community
Jennifer Huang

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system originally created at Yahoo and now part of the Apache Software Foundation(ASF). It is a multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging. After graduation from ASF, the community grows bigger and stronger, with more and more users and contributors. This presentation shares how Apache Pulsar develops a borderless community in a short period.

Jennifer Huang is an Apache Pulsar committer and a senior technical writer at StreamNative. She contributes to Apache Pulsar documentation and community development proactively. She is dedicated to growing the Apache Pulsar community globally.

hello everyone

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,840
i will introduce apache process about

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,840
initial community today

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
i'm jennifer a patreon producer

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
commissioner and accountant strategist

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
at the stream native responsible for

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
various

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,280
content and the community growth today i

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,000
will introduce a passion pulsar from

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,399
four perspectives introduce a passion

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,520
for

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
history our diverse community community

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
culture

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:59,440
pinpoints and opportunities first

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,800
i will introduce a passion poser

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,840
does anyone know a person poster

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,640
if you search it in google

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
search a person you might find some

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
picture like this

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
if you search poser you will find some

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
models like this

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,040
and together they become a passion poser

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,240
which module is best

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,799
which runs fastest

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,840
we can discuss this later and today i

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
will introduce

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,040
another apache pulsar a cloud native

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,439
distributed messaging and event platform

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
first let's have a look at the

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,799
oppression process

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,000
in 2013 to solve its inner

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,840
uh problems yahoo built fosa as a cloud

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,720
messaging

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
and three years later yahoo open source

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,759
process

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,719
and in 27 porsa entered

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,119
a persian software foundation and after

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,280
one year's graduate as top level

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,159
oppression project

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
last year we began to promote a persian

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,879
process

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,319
actively all over the world and host

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,920
10 more meetups and win 100

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,520
more adopters this year to make possible

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,239
more user-friendly

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
we enrich prosaic ecosystem and build

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,360
stream native cloud

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,200
make pulsa as a service reality

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,319
[Music]

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,360
as you can see in this inverted

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
pyramid pulsar community is composed of

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
users

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,400
contributors committers and pmc

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,000
users and contributors play a large part

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,560
in our community

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
so we care our users and contributors

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
as you can see in this picture we have

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,560
over 100

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,760
users over the world some big

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
um some big industries like arizona

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
media

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,000
yahoo japan splunk apple aipo

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,959
hulu and some others and in china only

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we have more than 40 users

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:19,040
like consent

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,040
channel mobile channel telecom and

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
our users come from different industries

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
and

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
they use a passion process in different

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,519
use cases

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
they build they use a passion process to

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,319
build event center

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,640
like gene enterprise you see the input

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,720
notification like the tree or

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,879
transaction like tencent and

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,239
hulu you use it in iot scenarios such as

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:52,879
emq and tuia to build the smart

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:57,040
home we also have other use cases

00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:01,200
so it's an easter here you can see it

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,239
if you um if you search apache pulsar

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,120
and the kafka in google you will find

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
some articles like kafka in no longer

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,239
keen for big data kafka is not biased

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,720
anymore

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
meet posa and they will share some

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
reasons

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,680
why they choose a persian person and

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
why they finally moved to a passion

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
process

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
so we believe that we will have more

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,600
users

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:32,840
in the up in the upcoming near future

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
now i will introduce some some

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,680
contribution growth

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,160
in the last year in last

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:47,040
november we have about 117 contributors

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,840
1 000 active members on slide and widget

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
and in after less than a year now we

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,520
have

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,880
over 300 contributors

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,080
over 2000 active members on slack and

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,280
widget

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,800
those contributors contribute to most of

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,240
our pro requests and commits so

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,280
you have to see that we have very

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,280
large pr numbers folks and the stars

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,560
and i will introduce some active on some

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,960
key magics that develops care most

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,080
every month we have about more than 100

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,039
active requests and the issues

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,639
as you can see in last month we have

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,960
171 active pro requests and merged 127

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,240
of

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:45,440
them among the 136 active

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
issues we fixed the 84 of them so you

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,320
can see

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,320
that we are quite active in our

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,360
community

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,840
so i also showed the figures about

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
the commit in last year you can see

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,400
every week

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,400
we have averaged about 20 commits

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,080
for the cloners and the known

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,080
numbers you can see that a pulsar has

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,199
a win 12 or 13

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,319
on throwing the clones in every two

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
weeks

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,639
from about four hundred kilometers this

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,639
is a huge number

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,319
and for the page views also at least

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,600
the numbers in two weeks we have

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,560
about 36 000 views

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,560
from about 400 unique visitors

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,680
so you can set everything's open source

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,680
pulsar within its active contribution

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
thank you for your effort for our

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
contributor

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
for posa

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,120
another thing that developer care mostly

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
is about

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
pulsar release ever since the end of

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,240
last year

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,360
we adopted post we adopted a time-based

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,639
release plan

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,599
every three months we would have a major

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,880
release

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,160
and in doubt and and adopt

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,360
the features that our users care most

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,880
and every month we would have a manager

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,160
we would fix some bugs if the release

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
how and

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,880
improve its functionalities and

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,880
performance

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,360
so we also maintain our project quite

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,360
proactively

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,280
to make posa uh user-friendly

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,919
we build a process ecosystem and have

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
various

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
things and the sources currently we have

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,800
about

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,280
30 things and the sources around pulsar

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,879
will also build pulsar flink connector

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,840
processback connector while some of

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,280
loaders like

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,720
adaptis i3 uploader file system

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,160
of loader gcs offloader we also built

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,479
kafka on pulsar

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,759
amqt amposa and the mqtt on pulsar

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,440
if users are using kafka am

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,319
amqp or mqtt they can migrate

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
their data or applications to pulsa

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,320
easily

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,800
so if we want to explore the

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,240
the full process ecosystem you can read

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,760
the stream that you have

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,480
you can find all of them there if

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,360
the one you are using we don't support

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,399
at the moment

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,839
feel free to contact us we can develop

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
the ecosystem together

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,200
now i just introduced some key messages

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
that the developer care most

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,279
i want to say that pulsar community is a

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,839
diverse community

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,160
we have more than code we also provide

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,360
comprehensive

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,360
documentation to help our users

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
and the community to quite understand

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,480
the apache process

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,200
to better understand it

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,560
since we have a global community

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,880
so we have some localization project

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,320
for pulsar dogs currently our

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,640
pro localization project is uh

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,279
in french japan chinese simplify the

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
chinese

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,760
traditional and some also ask for

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
polish so if you are interested in the

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,160
localization project

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,160
you can also reach out to us

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
we also work with our engineers on some

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,519
technical blogs

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,360
to people dial some key features

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,839
we work with our users on some success

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
story

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,480
we also provide professional trainees

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
and invite postal experts to our

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
training

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,680
like webler and tjip

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,839
wow launched the global conference like

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,040
process meet and the local meetups

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,800
so our contributors or users in our

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
community can communicate

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
easily

the growth the community growth that we

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,880
also might some pinpoints and

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,600
opportunities now i will show some

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,680
pinpoints

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,480

we should

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,480
our users are quite iq in those

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,920
distributions in those channels they

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,120
would ask

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,320
us some questions when they might

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,279
however um it's hard to collect those

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,959
questions and

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,959
reuse them so the other time will

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,279
another

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,560
user meet the same question how to

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
answer the question

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,880
the same question again so we are trying

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,320
to encourage our users to ask questions

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,000
in open forum

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,320
so it will be easy to search those qas

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,839
and

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,079
reuse the answer in the new in the

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,399
future

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,560
this is really a pinpoint in our

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:59,360
community i'm not sure whether our

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,480
other community has the same pinpoints

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
another question another point is how to

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,600
explore

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,480

sorry if i mispronounced that he said do

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,880
you get good

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
support from the companies

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,520
um yeah uh

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,280
how do you see the good support from

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,640
companies

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,440
you mean from different companies from

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,440
our users

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,000
uh if the question means we could get

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,520
the support from our

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,960
user companies i see that yes our users

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,240
are quite to support you

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,880
and provide a lot of

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,559
information on how to improve a

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,679
oppression puzzle

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,000
and they also they are very glad to work

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,039
with

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,240
us on their success stories

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,440
they are some some users

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,880
are very supportive and

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,520
would help us promote a person pulsar

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,400
in their in their company in their

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,600
businesses

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
and in other businesses for example like

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,360
a tone center

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,720
first they adopt a pulsar in beaming

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
system

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,640
and later they found that it's a ideal

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,679
solution for them

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,159
so they began to help help us

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,720
to promote operation process in their

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,159
different

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,080
businesses like iot or ai okay

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,600
so richard has added a few more things

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,520
here he said

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
he says he has experience from a

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,600
university context

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,559
where volunteer developers don't get

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,799
paid

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,400
and so it makes the development you know

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,960
not sustainable

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
so i think yeah it sounds like the

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,799
question is

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,559
is more like you know with are people

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:13,840
being paid to work on it um as well

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,840
or is it all completely volunteers

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,320
ah good question actually here uh

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,120
some of our uh volunteer developers that

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,080
are from

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,400
um our users and some of them

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,720
people who are interested in pulsar they

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,960
want to learn more about the puzzle

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,799
them i i think the more you get with the

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,880
more you take you take

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:42,080
um for i want to tell you the truth that

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,480
some of our volunteer developers

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,039
i um joined our company at last

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,679
yeah yeah there's a comment here saying

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,240
yes

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,000
um it's a common problem for open source

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
communities which i think is true

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,640
you get people that can contribute on a

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,799
volunteer basis and you get some people

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,400
that work for companies that use the

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,159
software so therefore

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,080
they have they want to maybe either give

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
back or actually help support their

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,360
business by having

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,640
people in in that community as well or

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,280
paying people to work on it

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
so it's a bit of it's a bit of a mix so

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,000
i think it's

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,120
it's nice where companies can give back

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,799
as well i think

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,559
yeah okay so yeah

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,000
okay that was a thank you from richard

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,440
