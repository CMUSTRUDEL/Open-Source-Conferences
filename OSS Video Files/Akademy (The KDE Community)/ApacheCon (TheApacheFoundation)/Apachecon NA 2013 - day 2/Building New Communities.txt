right building new communities first of

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,710
all obviously when you're working like

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,960
that it's important to know who you're

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,599
dealing with so I thought I'd just

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,309
introduce myself quickly I was trained

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,340
as a computational scientist although I

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:21,720
actually worked with computers for about

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,550
five years before i took my degree I'm a

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,400
York Sherman in Yorkshire we say we've

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,380
got two long pockets and short arms it's

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,480
not that we're mean it's just that we're

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,059
careful with our money and I've been

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,700
involved in community development in

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,370
information technology for quite a long

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,070
time most recently with the Python

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,899
Software Foundation and one of my

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:51,210
special interest is is trying to make

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:54,230
communities more diverse so about 20

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,030
years ago coming up to 20 years ago I

00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,840
thought that the open source was likely

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,280
to be significant and so I decided to

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,960
try an experiment and you've probably

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,869
heard people come to open-source

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,939
conferences and say well open source has

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:15,540
given us so much we decided we'd like to

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:17,040
give something back well I decided as an

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,869
experiment just to try and see what

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,030
happened if you gave something without

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,030
waiting to get something first and so I

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,240
basically spent the last 20 years giving

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,360
back to the Python world in the fond

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,740
expectation that one day it will

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,310
actually be worth something to me and

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,930
the time plan was 20 years I'm 18 and a

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,909
half years into that plan now and I've

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,729
given up as Python software foundation

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,450
chairman so I can focus on on my

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,710
business again so that's me who's the

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,619
apparent of the apache software

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,630
foundation well of course none of these

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,229
none of these bullet points is strictly

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,270
true but if you don't belong to the

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,600
apache software foundation if you're not

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,079
a part of the the Apache community then

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,009
it could very well seem that way to some

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,750
people we are outrageous nerds who have

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,790
you know no idea what the real worlds

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,530
like the difference between an

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,300
introverted geek and an extrovert

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,830
geek is the introverted geek looks at

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,569
his own feet when he's talking at you

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,250
and the extroverted geek looks at your

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,260
feet when he's talking to you that kind

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,360
of stuff very very commonplace

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,490
misperceptions of geeks so I did just

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,310
want to underline at the start of these

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,959
remarks that I'm not either a member of

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,850
the pice and software foundation or

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,150
sorry of the apache software foundation

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,910
or the Apache community so I have to

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,860
confess that some of my remarks are

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,110
likely to be based on ignorance and I

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,040
just wanted to make that clear so I'm

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,170
perfectly happy to stand corrected at

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,040
any point if if people have information

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,819
that I wasn't that I wasn't privy to so

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,180
in my attempt to broaden the Python

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,250
community and we had people towards the

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,500
beginning of my my efforts saying well

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,800
why are you trying to get the Python

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,080
Software Foundation to market itself we

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,630
don't do marketing where where where

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,530
techies where tech heads we don't do

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,989
that kind of stuff we don't need lawyers

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,970
of the three remarks that I've bulleted

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,700
up on the screen there the the worst one

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,190
unfortunate was a remark I was forced to

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,070
make when we we had a disastrously

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,700
expensive PyCon one year due to a severe

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,450
downturn in the economy and if we hadn't

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,100
actually had to defer those trademark

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,230
applications then we wouldn't now be

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,820
involved in negotiations with someone

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,140
who was trying to register a Python

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,609
trademark in the UK fortunately it does

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,500
look as though that issues going to be

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,150
amicably settled but it would never have

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,340
arisen had we been able to go forward

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,600
and and reserve those trademarks so

00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,609
that's of course one of the things that

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,790
foundations do our part of the

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,829
intellectual property of the Apache

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,040
brand if you like is the very name

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,600
Apache and the feather symbol and it's

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,760
simply a matter of fact that in

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,130
trademark law if you are not seen to

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,169
zealously look for abuses of your

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,989
trademark and defend them then your

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,370
trademark can actually become

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:24,150
effectively public domain that happened

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:28,500
for example to Xerox which became a

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,960
um effectively a generic name for

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:37,680
copying technology and Hoover became a

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:39,539
generic name for vacuum cleaners so in

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,610
this world people are going to think

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:44,550
things about you so it's up to you to

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,139
decide are you going to try to to direct

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,660
those thoughts or are you just going to

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,789
let people choose to think what they

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,940
want to do and I think some of the

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:55,800
confusing things that might be confusing

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,160
to outsiders certainly it's the case in

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,020
the Python world is people don't really

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,150
understand the relationship between the

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,270
Python software foundation itself and

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,740
the much much larger Python community I

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,130
think at the moment the Python

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,610
foundation software foundation has maybe

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:17,699
if we're lucky 250 members at most and

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,340
yet the worldwide Python community is in

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,530
the hundreds of thousands now so how do

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,810
we claim to be representative of a

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,220
community that size and how do we

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,720
actually exercise any kind of leadership

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,979
over that community these are very

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,840
important questions and the easiest way

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,190
to try to project a message particularly

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,070
when you're trying to project that

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,240
message through a root-and-branch

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:48,150
community is to start with clear values

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,960
if you can communicate your core values

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,430
effectively then people know instantly

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,190
simply by referring to the values what

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,659
the right course of action is in certain

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,389
circumstances and of course it also

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:03,000
means that you're more likely to be

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,970
perceived in the ways that you're your

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,289
core values indicate you'd like to be

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,810
and it makes it easier to actually

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:15,060
communicate the the fundamental purpose

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:17,490
of your existence and it isn't easy to

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,639
manage perceptions and it's not

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,979
something that you can do in in a year

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
even or two years you can't turn on a

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,440
dime and when I was thinking of how I

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,120
could make that clear i was reminded of

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,770
the story of the college lon i don't

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,349
know how many of you been to Cambridge

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,090
in England but some of the colleges

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,270
there and I believe modeling College in

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,930
particular have

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,720
wonderful wonderful lawns these huge

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,450
expanses of dead flat grass many of them

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,220
with majestic trees standing in the

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,890
middle and the stories told of how an

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,810
American tourist was talking to the

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,910
groundsman at one of these colleges and

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,950
he said you know I'd really like a lawn

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,110
like that he said is it difficult he

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,790
said no sir it's not at all difficult to

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,280
make a lawn like that I said oh how do

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,320
you do it said well first of all you you

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,880
level the ground and you and your plants

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,820
you seed and you let it grow a bit and

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,330
then you roll it yeah he said and then

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,310
you mow it yeah and then you roll it

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,680
again yeah and then you mow it again

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,390
yeah and if you do that for about 300

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,910
years you get a really nice piece of

00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:29,380
grass so some efforts take a long time

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,640
and my the parent company of the open

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,210
bastion which is the company that's

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,490
producing this Holden web even when it

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,100
was only a one-man business it managed

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,990
to get a google pagerank of 5 for its

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,520
website people you ask used to ask me

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,340
how I did that and it's it's a very

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,230
similar story really what you do is you

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,160
make sure that your website and your

00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,930
name are in your email signature and

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,510
then you spend about eight years making

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,160
approximately 200,000 contributions to

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,480
various different technical newsgroups

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,240
where you're helping people with their

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,430
problems and lo and behold all of a

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,130
sudden there's this massive web

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,830
references pointing to your website so

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,960
you can change perceptions you can

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,750
adjust perceptions but you can't expect

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,020
it to be a quick job and when it comes

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,300
to building community my Brazilian

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,850
friend Enrique bust us said it very well

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,680
he said really the goal is not if you

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,690
want to build a community the best way

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,960
to do it isn't to just try and do that

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,880
as an abstract affair what you should do

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,850
is you should hold events and the people

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,580
who come to your events are your

00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,370
community and that's really the way it

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,070
certainly worked with with python i

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:46,390
started Pikkon we had the first PyCon in

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,150
2003 and this year we had 250 people I

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,180
think they're that

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:53,560
that time and this year the 11 of one

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:56,300
it's a sellout at 2,500 so you can grow

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,960
communities but that involves teaching

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,460
and teaching as i know because a part of

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,950
my professional responsibilities

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,500
involved teaching teaching is is not an

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,510
easy job it's one that demands a lot of

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,040
preparation and generally speaking i

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,370
don't think that teaching and

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,470
particularly the teaching of children is

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,350
sufficiently well valued today in modern

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,690
societies but it's always interesting to

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,000
reflect on whether we are actually as

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,840
clever as we think we are and i heard a

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,210
really interesting story for some reason

00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,990
i think by accident rather than design

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,970
but for some reason a crate of XO

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,760
machines that's the the one laptop per

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,200
child machine a crate of those machines

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,860
was delivered to a village and this

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,110
village was so poor and there was such a

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:50,600
low level of literacy that they didn't

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,550
even have street signs and so the the

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,320
creative exo's was delivered there and

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,850
they just thought well you know we can't

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,430
put the support services that we

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,380
normally do in to explain to the kids

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,870
how to use it so on but hey we've got

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,760
the machines there let's just see how

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,240
they do and this bunch of illiterate

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,340
african village kids within six months

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,670
had routed that that those computers

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,470
they got full control over the hardware

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,590
bypassing protections that had been

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,870
built in and designed by fairly

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,690
significant computer scientists so i

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,740
think when we took when we think about

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:31,250
teaching I think we have to stop using

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,820
the paradigm that teaching is always

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,970
about someone with superior education

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,770
trying to pass information to to someone

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,320
who doesn't possess it it's not

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:46,280
necessarily about that when we're trying

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,790
to teach we need to be unafraid to

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,490
actually learn as we're teaching I ran a

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,090
session at PyCon about eight years ago

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,800
called teach me twisted because I wanted

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,140
to understand about a particular

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,450
technology the twisted networking

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,710
technology in in the Python world and so

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,450
I just stood up in front of the audience

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,760
and said look this stuff I know nothing

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,070
about so I'm just going to try and stand

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,190
here and learn it publicly and I had you

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,110
know members of the twisted team in the

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,240
audience and I started out with a simple

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:21,950
question here how do I access my website

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:25,250
in twisted and before anyone really knew

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,960
it we were deep into reasons of my

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,150
particular design decisions had been

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,180
made and that kind of stuff but the

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,760
point is that teachers now shouldn't

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,620
expect to be the possessors of all

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,260
knowledge they shouldn't expect to be in

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,560
a privileged position simply by virtue

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,950
of the possession of certain knowledge

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,200
teaching is a skill which involves

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:52,580
explaining to growing people of all ages

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,740
how to use their faculties to solve the

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,530
problems that they need and teachers of

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,320
course being people too they have their

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,630
own problems and I think open source is

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,130
actually helping to make the the

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,340
teaching world the education world

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,140
better the way that now the academic

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,090
world has embraced the idea of open

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,900
publication and realized that was

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:18,290
ridiculous to spend huge amounts of

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,940
money public money funding research of

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,730
various kinds and then to have the

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,040
results of that research locked up

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:28,490
behind what are really ridiculous and

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,680
perhaps even unjustifiably expensive pay

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,140
walls and of course there are

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,420
technologies now this the the piece of

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,070
hardware that I have in my hand here I

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,860
doubt that the camera will be able to

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,260
show any adequate representation of it

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,750
but this is called a teensie board it's

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,080
about the same size as a 20 pin dual

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,640
inline integrated circuit package which

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,500
20 years ago would maybe be a dynamic

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,750
Ram controller or something like that

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,210
and it's it's a full arduino spec

00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,170
machine which can control hardware of

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:02,270
various kinds this machine which is a

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,310
particular favorite of mine because it

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,600
was designed with Python as the

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,590
programming language in mind the

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,160
raspberry pi is a $35 computer with two

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:17,329
USB sockets an Ethernet lead

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,519
a composite video and an hdmi output and

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:23,930
access to various programmable digital

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,970
pins as well and these tools have come

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,610
about because the hardware world has

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,550
started to adopt the same design ethos

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,230
that the software world has and of

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,180
course when it comes to open source in

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,699
the software world the apache software

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,959
foundation is the leader there's there's

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:46,670
no doubt about it so you've got this

00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:47,930
thing of being a meritocracy and so one

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,939
of the one of the things I'm interested

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,670
in is well how do you actually market

00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:54,500
and meritocracy to people do people

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,540
actually want to be clear do people want

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,860
to join when somebody hears while the

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,829
apache software foundation is a

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,449
meritocracy what do they actually make

00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:06,139
of that and the problem is of course

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:09,319
that perception is actually a reality I

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,480
mean it's perfectly okay to have a

00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:14,329
meritocracy but you need to communicate

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,050
now of course when I did a bit more

00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:21,019
research I found out that the the the

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,420
question of merit doesn't have a central

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,880
definition in fact the the foundation

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,180
quite sensibly leaves it to each of the

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,850
pmcs to determine who has merit and how

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,199
they demonstrated merits so I was

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,939
actually quite relieved to see that

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,740
there isn't somewhere a stone tablet

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:39,529
with the definition of merit written on

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,970
it and you everyone has to be forced

00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,860
through the hole and if not too much

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,300
flesh scrapes off and they've got merit

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,089
and they're allowed through the door

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,519
kind of thing and I think that the

00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,500
Foundation's done extremely well to get

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,300
these what is it now a hundred and

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,579
eighty projects something like that if

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,779
you include the pod llings all these

00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:02,420
projects going but at the same time I

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:04,160
have to wonder because I know from my

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,930
own experience in the Python Software

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,319
Foundation it's sometimes difficult to

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,819
do necessary things without

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:13,160
administration I have to wonder if maybe

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:16,189
the foundation isn't isn't a bit light

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,899
in certain areas and I do know in the

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:20,209
software world the things that tend to

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:22,519
get dropped on the floor of the things

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,380
that nobody really wants to do anyway

00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,850
and and the open source world is really

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,500
convenient like that

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:32,149
he can come and say well you've got to

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:37,490
do this then we have to herd cats we

00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:40,970
can't compel people now when people are

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,519
making history it's very unusual for

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:47,870
them to actually realize it so if I tell

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,639
you now but for the past 30 or 40 years

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,860
the software world has been making

00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,550
history you might think I'm burbling and

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,079
you know it's it's not a matter of of

00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,759
much concern to me whether I'll be

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,040
proved correct or not because over the

00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,600
the time scale I've got left on this

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,610
this earth it's very unlikely that

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,670
anyone will be able to make any sensible

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:13,069
conclusions but we have to remember that

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:15,800
the we as technologists are defining the

00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:18,440
systems which will operate which will

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,660
determine the way that the world works

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,560
and that gives us a considerable degree

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:27,370
of power and of course with with power

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,779
comes responsibility so we need to think

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,759
about how we're going to shape

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,250
technology and and how that's going to

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,810
affect the people whose lives are

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,000
affected ultimately by two were

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,380
principally the end users who have to

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,670
consume the technology without

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,649
necessarily getting much say at all into

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,529
into how it gets develops or to what

00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:51,230
shape it has and I mean thinking about

00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:54,470
for example something as complex as the

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,480
law which is your law in this country is

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,329
what 300 years old now something like

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,610
that bit more if we ever had a piece of

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,259
software 300 years old of course we'd

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,699
probably think it need refactoring it

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,380
was interesting to hear what the the

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,039
panel said about a software a piece of

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,250
software with a lifetime of of 50 years

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:16,370
but the world is changing and we're

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,240
responsible for those changes now when

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:22,970
you look at economic theory the theory

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,490
of you and I can understand economists

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,770
and econometricians they want to

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,970
represent their field as a science and

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,080
so in order for economics to be a

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,960
respectable science then there has to be

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,909
something called the economy but in

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,230
actual fact I've been reading a book

00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:42,590
recently called debt the

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:48,650
first 5000 years and it turns out that

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:51,890
that the economic myth is that before

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,110
money existed we had to have barter

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,900
systems and so you would trade for

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,120
chickens for a sheep or whatever which

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,549
was okay as long as the guy who had the

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,470
sheet needed the four chickens that you

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,570
could offer him now in actual fact

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,780
that's that's not the way that varta

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:14,540
based systems work at all it turns out

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:18,610
after considerable research that the way

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,410
barter systems work is that people

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,740
simply help their neighbors out when

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,600
they are in some way socially usually it

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,730
would be social forces that would that

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,040
would make someone help their neighbor

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,140
yeah you can imagine if you live in a

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,990
closed community of a small number of

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,580
people if you start to behave like an

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,929
 to your neighbors then word is

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,940
going to get round and people aren't

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:43,640
going to help you so there's a certain

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,460
amount of of mutual support there that

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,140
you can compel people to to not behave

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,510
too much like an simply by

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,580
withholding your support from them and

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,440
you know in some cases maybe once every

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,080
three months or once every six months

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,270
there'd be a big meeting and you know

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,040
Angela would say well Gillian owes me a

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,260
chicken and Julian would say well right

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,320
but Sam's got three pigs of mine this

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,120
kind of stuff they'd be a reckoning many

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,220
debts would cancel each other out and

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,120
they'd go forward with with the decks

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:17,650
resolved so debt has actually exit

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:22,220
actually existed before currency in

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:25,669
terms of a recorded even an informally

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,360
recorded obligation to repay something

00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:31,070
that somebody gave you and if you want

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,080
to think about it in that way and if you

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,059
want to think about your contributions

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,040
to open source as as having value which

00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,120
I think having just listen to the

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,720
business panel we should all be

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:49,610
convinced that it does have value in in

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,980
economic terms but the problem is that

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,820
we live in a completely dysfunctional

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,039
world

00:19:52,820 --> 00:20:01,669
and it seems to me that the governmental

00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,679
systems that we are ruled by are

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:06,110
completely antiquated and not using

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,179
appropriate technologies I've spoken to

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,049
a couple of different teams who've

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:13,820
worked with lawmakers to codify

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,860
legislation and they all say that the

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,220
processes that are used their arcane

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:22,070
they're antiquated beyond belief in some

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:25,279
legislations there is no canonical copy

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,070
of the codified law they simply have to

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,529
go back through several revisions to get

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,740
to the original law and so on and so

00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,720
forth now that gave rise to a blog post

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,669
called refactor the law where I I

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,039
maintained that you know if we had a

00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:42,860
piece of software that had been put

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,029
together the way the law has been put

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,009
together you know give your local

00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,720
congressman ten million dollars and you

00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,820
can get your own subroutine that always

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,750
returns results in lower case that kind

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,049
of stuff if software was constructed the

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,669
way law was constructed then we wouldn't

00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,929
be running computer systems at all

00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,259
frankly because it would just be

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:05,330
hopelessly complicated lee subject to

00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,580
the laws of unintended consequences just

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,789
the same way that for example the tax

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,769
code is is frequently so the apache

00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:15,970
software foundation may not realize

00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:21,080
quite what it started by being the first

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:23,960
open source foundation but you you have

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,570
got the power by the by virtue of your

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,309
ability to build these amazing

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:32,450
technologies that allow us to construct

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:35,360
systems that can effectively do things

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,879
far more complex than could ever be

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,970
controlled manually at even a fraction a

00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:43,940
significant fraction of the volume that

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,379
data is being handled nowadays and there

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,659
are some interesting changes as well I

00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:48,980
personally feel that open open office is

00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,649
going to be very interesting for the

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,240
foundation because suddenly you have a

00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:55,519
project with a very large user base

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,549
almost none of whom are primarily

00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,529
technical and so it's going to be

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:03,950
interesting to see how the foundation

00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,610
decides to try to to interact with with

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,000
those people

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:12,540
so the open source world has a lot of

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,060
good things that it can say about itself

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:21,850
and it would living in a time where I

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:24,460
think a lot of people fear change and

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,080
obviously there are very reasons for

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,120
them to fear change I mean change brings

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,640
uncertainty and people don't like

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,240
uncertainty it doesn't allow them to

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,250
make plans that kind of stuff so and not

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,860
only that but people feel chain of fear

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,540
change I think as well because their

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,880
circumstances their material

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,550
circumstances have in many cases

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,670
becoming been becoming worse with every

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,710
change and so they see further change as

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:55,390
making things worse and I think the

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:59,800
issue today for democratic societies is

00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:03,160
to try to engage the citizenry at the

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:07,210
moment it's in vogue to complain about

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,100
the political process but yet even

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,970
though we claim to be a representative

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:15,220
or Republican democracy or whatever we

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,550
claim to be a system where voter input

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,640
is a significant factor in the ruling

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:24,430
process nevertheless people don't feel

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,100
that just voting once every two or four

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,660
years is actually giving them any say in

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,080
what happens and I think that the way

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:36,190
people's lives have changed well

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,480
justifies that so Sarah Novotny who if

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,960
you don't know where is one of the

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,050
co-chairs of Oz com wrote a couple of

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,960
years ago that we must challenge the

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:50,230
idea that if someone really wants to use

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,360
a piece of software he or she will be

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,110
willing to slog through half written

00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:01,200
documentation the actual code base and

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:04,780
an unkind user interface and she's right

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,760
one of the challenges is as you you can

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,340
think of the marketers we used to when i

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,260
worked at Sun Microsystems a very long

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,600
time ago now I was badge number fifteen

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,060
hundred and thirty-two I think but there

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,190
the market was presented to us technical

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,200
types as being a pyramid with the

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,480
the early adopters at the top the people

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,039
who would pay top dollar for the latest

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,919
technology because it would allow them

00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,529
to improve their process make more

00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,960
profits whatever and you know finally

00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:35,559
down at the bottom of the period pyramid

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,049
you enter the mass consumer market well

00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:41,320
openoffice is going to suddenly move you

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:44,230
a lot closer to the the mass consumer

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,179
end of that market and so you've got

00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,679
some questions to ask yourself here do

00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,929
you actually want to include these

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,620
people do you want to invite them to

00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:55,059
your conferences or do you want to be a

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,129
somewhat distant body that's simply

00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:02,139
responsible for producing the software

00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:04,210
that rules people's lives and a very

00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:09,309
interesting topic when we were planning

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:11,200
this year's Apache Khan was just exactly

00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,000
what concessions we would make two

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,639
speakers and I think it's it's fairly

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,139
readily understandable as a conference

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:20,470
organizer that if I can't attract

00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:21,700
speakers to the conference then I'm not

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,379
going to be able to attract anyone else

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,659
right if you've got nonentities as

00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:27,519
speakers people who don't know their

00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:30,820
stuff if we can't get people to submit

00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,970
talks then we will not have much of a

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,549
conference and yet I find that attitude

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,139
to be so at odds with the attitude of

00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:40,960
the Python world that I thought I would

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:42,669
like to at least start a discussion this

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,700
week where you could actually get at me

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,230
and let me know your feelings directly

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,690
just to see what what the difference is

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,870
between the Python world and the Apache

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:55,240
world in the Python world the general

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:58,389
feeling is that the right way to go is

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,090
to have as inclusive of conferences as

00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:03,759
we possibly can and that means that

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,700
everyone pays even guido van rossum the

00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:10,539
guy who invented the Python language

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,129
pays to go to pike on so if anybody used

00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:14,590
to complain about you hell hey I'm

00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:16,509
speaking why do i have to pay i just

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,580
used to say well guidos paying and that

00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:20,019
solved all the problems served Jim get

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:25,480
your hand in your pocket next year and

00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:27,399
well we'll move on so the open source

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,379
world has to bear in mind some important

00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,480
human characteristics which have been I

00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,730
think notably lacking

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,860
in the certainly the two political

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,890
processes I'm most familiar with that is

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:41,950
the United States and the UK for far too

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:45,990
long nowadays political opposition seems

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:49,930
to be seems to be posed in terms of

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:52,270
complete completely denying the opponent

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,820
even so much as the right to exist and

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,830
yet whenever you have any kind of a

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,780
group at all whenever you draw any kind

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,970
of a boundary around the system of any

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:04,090
kind there's an inside and an outside

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,670
there's an interface and there's things

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,310
going on outside that interface and we

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,080
have to remember that even people who

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,510
don't know anything at all about

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,980
technology have the right to exist even

00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,900
though they may not in the apache

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,860
software foundation's terms actually

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:24,100
possess merit so people have different

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:28,090
comfort levels and one of the things I

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,700
struggled very hard with was diversity

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,710
issues within the the Python world and

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,730
people don't seem to realize that

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,770
actually in order to to encourage a

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:43,150
diverse environment you don't have to

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:46,180
have specific rules of behavior so much

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:49,000
as specific rules for making sure that

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,370
no individual is taken or forced outside

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,580
their comfort level or made to feel

00:27:51,370 --> 00:28:00,580
inferior or unwelcome and so the purpose

00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:02,140
of the the code of conduct is simply to

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,540
explain to people that you know some

00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,630
behaviors will be unacceptable and there

00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,520
are ways for dealing with them so I

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,350
think in terms of the challenges current

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,000
challenges to the foundation gender

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,620
diversity is very definitely an issue

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,110
it's one that we've struggled with hard

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,270
in the Python Software Foundation and

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,950
we're still not we're still not there by

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,630
a long way but at least we've made a

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,210
promising start with the introduction of

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,460
the the PI ladies chapters I think

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,710
they've got 60 chapters now python

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:32,620
programming for women groups across the

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,460
world obviously with such a diverse

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,930
range of projects it's difficult to try

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,850
and set standards which everyone can

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,530
sensibly are dear to and I think that

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,230
there's the I've from what I've heard so

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,280
far the significant progress being made

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,840
in unit

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,410
buying that the technical standards it

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,180
makes sense to unify and I think that

00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,720
the biggest challenge is actually going

00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:59,230
to try going to be trying to demonstrate

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,280
relevance to a wider public as the the

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:05,520
foundations influence continues to grow

00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,660
so that was all I really wanted to say

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,850
probably no time for questions

00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,290
unfortunately but you can you can find

00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,140
me around at the conference and these

00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:16,660
are matters I'm always very happy to

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,470
discuss but basically all I'm trying to

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:24,850
say is that a commune of the more broad

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:26,680
and the more diverse a community is the

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,200
better that is for the community the

00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,350
more healthy it is the wider range of

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,810
people you will be able to satisfy with

00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:38,140
the products and the project that you

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:40,210
create and we need to I sometimes like

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,610
in the open source world if people say

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,920
well how you what goes on in the open

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,660
source world what do people do and I say

00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,520
well it's almost as though when

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,030
President Eisenhower said we need

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,410
interstates in the 1930s it's almost as

00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,240
though a bunch of guys said yeah that's

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,240
a great idea and picked up picks and

00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,060
shovels and went out and started to

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,590
build them so the open source world and

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:07,270
the apache software foundation in

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:10,180
particular has built a huge common good

00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:13,360
which has generated enormous amounts of

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:17,230
economic benefit across a wide range of

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,390
individual organizations and if you

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,850
remember that being a member of a

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,700
community means being prepared to accept

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:27,340
a constant state of mutual obligation

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,380
then it will be less difficult to

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,730
remember that not only have you given

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,710
the world something but there's

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,830
something that the world can give you if

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:40,110
you'll just open your doors and let them

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,110
