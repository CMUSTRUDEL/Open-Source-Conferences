	Home automation with Apache
Christofer Dutz

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Even if Apache PLC4X was initiated in order to communicate with industrial hardware, in the last years it has grown to also allow communication with building and home-automation systems. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how I use Apache PLC4X to communicate with the KNX, Modbus and Luxtronic2 drivers to talk to my house and how easy it is to store this data in Apache IoTDB (Incubating) to process it with Apache Camel, Apache NiFi, Apache Edgent (Incubating) (RIP) or others and to create a Frontend using Apache Royale (perhaps even with some nifty Apache ECharts (incubating) diagrams).

Full blooded Apache Member, who likes to think out of the box. If others say something's impossible, that's when Chris starts to become interested. He's involved in numerous Apache and even more non-Apache projects and currently serving as the VP of Apache PLC4X which he had the pleasure and the luck to write the first lines of code for (ok ... and a "few" after that).
