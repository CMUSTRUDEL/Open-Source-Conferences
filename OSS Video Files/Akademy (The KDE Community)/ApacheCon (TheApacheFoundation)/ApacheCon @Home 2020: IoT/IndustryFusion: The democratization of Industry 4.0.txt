A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Small and mediumsized machine manufacturers (SMEs) currently are undergoing a tremendous transformation process. For decades high quality machines were the main development focus and precision on the scale of a human hair made the engineers' hearts beat faster. However, growing global competition, changed customer requirements and the wish to extend innovation leadership require that additional data-driven services are offered to the cutsomers in addition to selling the machines. Implementing an IIoT-solution for their machines confronts the companies with two major challenges: 1. SMEs do not have the ressources to „experiment“ with proprietary IIoT-solutions, pushing them into an undesirable vendor lock-in. 2. The solution has to be interoperable with the solutions from other manufacturers, as usually up to 100 different machines are present in a factory and the customers only want to have one transparent Smart Factory and not 100 different digital solutions. In order to achieve an IIoT-solution that fits these needs of SMEs, a growing group of innovative machine manufacturers teamed up with IT- and Open-Source experts to implement IndustryFusion, a cross-manufacturer interoperable open source solution for Industry 4.0. IndustryFusion is an Apache 2.0 licensed, fully deployable End-2-End IIoT-solution covering all required layers - i.e. perception, network, middleware, application - for implementing a digital ecosystem. The architecture intergrates several Apache projects(PLC4X, Kafka, Cassandra, Beam, Flink) and can either run entirley on premises, using StarlingX, or be deployed in any cloud environment.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,760
on

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,760
industry fusion then democratization of

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,079
industry 4.0 and i will figure out how

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
to study

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,360
okay thank you very much true for the

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,120
introduction

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,879
hello everybody uh welcome um

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,160
to our talk industry fusion the

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
democratization

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,920
of industry 4.0

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,239
let's see you know we can switch the

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,199
slides

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,559
okay yeah all right well exactly who

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
will be presenting

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,960
um we don't only want to talk about uh

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,520
the technical solution in this diffusion

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,920
today

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,560
but also about uh the background and a

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,080
bit of the

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,920
history how we came to our solution of

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,240
industry 4.0

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
my name is constantine kensmith i'm the

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
head of research

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,320
and development at microsoft europe

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,360
which is a machine manufacturer who will

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
show you

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
later the kind of machines we are

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
actually

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,119
producing and um i'm there the technical

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,759
lead of industry fusion

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
on our way to the digitalization and

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
industry 4.0

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
and specifically they are bridging the

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
gap

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,240
between the let's say traditional

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,439
ot and the high key part of the machines

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,439
my name is matt mcconnina constantine is

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,720
a colleague of me we both work at

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
microsoft europe the machine

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,119
manufacturer and

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,280
yeah my role is

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
development for industry 4.0 at

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
microstep

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,800
and yeah here in this iot project

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
of industry fusion uh i kind of got

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,319
through the

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
project management describing the

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,440
requirements

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,800
um yeah and preparing it for development

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,120
and making the ux

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
which i'm also pretty passionate about

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
that it looks good

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,800
hi hello and i'm martin wagner i'm

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,200
working at intel's iot group

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
and i'm supporting the end to end and

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
the edge cloud

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
architecture of institution i'm working

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
closely with

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,760
constantinomet and

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,239
especially with regards to open source

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,239
projects

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,239
perfect so um let's start

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,319
uh with the picture that you all can get

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,040
an imagination before we go

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,120
uh to the data part and let's say to the

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,519
metal part of our background and that

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
will

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,760
i can give you a little introduction

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,040
about this so what you basically see

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,680
here

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,440
those are two things that's one micro

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
step plasma cutting machine so it's

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,200
basically machinery heavy machinery for

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,159
cutting heavy metal at

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
a certain factories um sheet plates of

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
metal are

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,640
cut with that pipes so um a

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
structural metal any kind of metal that

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
is needed for further

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,599
construction and welding and you can

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,220
also see a pretty typical

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
picture of a

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,920
[Music]

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,640
factory of an smb business here

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,239
in europe and i would say

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
although the plasma cutting or the

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,159
cutting itself is a pretty important

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
thing in the whole manufacturing um it's

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,799
not the

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
the only process our machines always

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,920
have to cooperate with

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,000
many other processes um within this

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,319
production line

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
with machines from many different

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
manufacturers

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,319
so it's a very heterogeneous machine

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,080
landscape that you basically see

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,759
in such a typical factory um

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
every time so you have um forklifts you

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,359
have uh

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,840
welding devices you have um yeah you

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,400
name it

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:30,080
a bunch of machines that are basically

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,360
set up here and um yeah regarding the it

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,320
and the software um the

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,120
focus of these machine manufacturers so

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,680
far was

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,520
more in the software that they offer

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,960
with their mission so for example with

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
our plasma cutting machine

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,639
we were trying to offer the best

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
possible software package

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,479
for making these machines as automated

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
as possible and

00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,160
the best to work with as possible

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,039
yeah but indeed there would be

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,800
something needed where we could connect

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,840
all these machines together and make

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
them communicate

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
and work together in a standardized way

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
like

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,960
a smart factory solution with which

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,039
um all these devices could communicate

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,680
and cooperate together without having to

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,639
set it up

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
over and over again

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,560
yep well um and that was also

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,039
the uh birth of an idea i think it was

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
2015 2016.

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,440
uh we founded the association of

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
industry business network that is the

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
association

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,320
that the micros was one of the

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,880
founding members because of that idea

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
that there

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
needs to be some kind of solution and

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,520
some kind of

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,400
way to really make industry 4.0 work

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,680
because we pretty quickly figured out

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,680
that it's not the

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,919
right way to basically

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,840
offer connectivity solutions only for

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,560
your machines and software only for your

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,680
machines

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,319
industry 4.0 yeah

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
is just a multiplayer game and we all

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,639
have to join together

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,160
and um yeah in order to make it work and

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
that was basically the idea

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
how we teamed up in the industry

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,639
business network um

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
maybe if you also take a look at the um

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,759
at the structure of

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,600
europe's market it's about

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,319
99 uh of the industry are smbs

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
so truly a lot many of them are family

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,400
owned many of them

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,160
are true technical market leaders in

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,919
their field

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,880
yeah but again small to medium-sized

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,240
companies

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,240
so it's a huge amount of those and

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
yeah we figured out that we truly have

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,280
to get together in order to

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:59,680
participate in this new economy and yeah

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,680
also get our devices connected together

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,960
so um in order to get such a connected

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
solution for a smart factory

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
um of course there are a lot of offers

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
already on the market

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,319
so what is the dilemma of these

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,120
platforms why didn't we just choose one

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
of them

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
um to go with our machines to make them

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
digital

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,440
so if you look at the typical um

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
let's say offering of an iot platform it

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
usually

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,479
looks similar to this picture at the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
bottom line you have

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,520
the machine for example our cutting

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,240
machine

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,440
and then in a sort of black box you have

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
normally some kind of

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
a gateway some kind of possibility to

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,599
get your data which is

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,080
sent to a cloud where you then as a user

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,360
can see some kind of dashboards where

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,319
you can see your data

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,400
but these parts are usually owned and

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,360
managed by the platform provider

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
and you as a user mainly for a certain

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
amount of money

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,319
depending on the device or the data

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,039
points you want to see

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,520
you can receive information to this

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,840
machine

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,039
which basically is okay but if you look

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,039
now um what matters actually just

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,080
talked about at the heterogeneous

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,199
landscape

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,759
in a factory on the shop floor

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,280
and you have all these different devices

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
not only the cutting machine

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
but from one manufacturer but for

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
example welding machine from the second

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
one

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,639
the train from the third manufacturer

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,599
and each of these

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,320
machine manufacturers decided to use a

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,120
different

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
uh iot platform to get his machine

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,599
digital

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,760
at the end you end up as a user with

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,480
10 or 20 different platforms from your

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
machine manufacturers from the providers

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,680
you actually don't have the benefits of

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
such an i.t solution of the totally

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
connected factory

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,720
that you actually would like to have but

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
you have like again

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,320
um island solutions

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
which provide information to each

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
machine

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,640
but which don't have the

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,080
interoperability and the transparency

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,560
that you actually want to have

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,120
for your smart factory and that exactly

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,839
was the basis that we said we need a

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
solution

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,120
which is open which is independent and

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,640
which

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,360
uh finally democratization of industry

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,480
maybe i returned back to the association

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,040
part

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,800
as we already told you we are the

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,279
association

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,080
brought together from small and

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,279
medium-sized

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,959
companies from the industry so we are no

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,519
i.t experts but we

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,680
really understood what we needed what

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,720
are the requirements for such a

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,640
iiot platform to make it work

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,880
so we don't know how to build that stuff

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,880
but we can definitely tell you what is

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,600
needed in reality

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,399
at all these shop floors because we know

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,360
the requirements of our customers

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
of our partners and yeah we live it each

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
and every day

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,839
so that was like the starting point for

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,839
this whole project

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,079
good yeah and if i

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,519
put two slides back in here now

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,160
um to to step to go a step back

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
so um let's have a look on the

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,079
functional level

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
um what actually does it mean to to do

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,800
an

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,079
industry 4.0 solution what do you

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,959
actually want to achieve

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,480
with such a digital solution and here's

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,720
a slide um

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
which actually shows it uh quite nice

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
because of course

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,000
in a lot of uh marketing departments uh

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,200
industry 4.0

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,320
is used as a password but there is not

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,880
only one solution for industry 4.0

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
it can be a lot of different steps that

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,399
you actually

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,240
can achieve on your journey to

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
digitalization

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,760
and the first two steps which are

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
actually still

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,880
in the industry 3.0 is the

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,040
computerization and the connectivity

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,399
so basically of course if you have

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,200
new machines if you have machines with a

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,399
lot of sensors you probably have already

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,959
the data you need but if you look at a

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
typical factory they are not only new

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,880
machines they are

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
on the shop floor but you have machines

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,200
that are maybe 20

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,640
30 years old which on a technical level

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
still work perfectly

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,640
but where you probably didn't even have

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,839
a control system

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,880
um where you can retrieve the data

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,079
or sensors which actually have the data

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
so in that case

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,320
you even have to go this step backwards

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,839
and see how you can get

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,760
to the data the second part is uh on

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,560
connectivity

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,079
especially in automation industry there

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
are different

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,320
bus systems on the shop floor level

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,480
which were there especially for the

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,360
connectivity between different uh

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
machines

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,120
but they are not necessarily the ones

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
you

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
need in a first step to receive the

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
information

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,839
uh for a digital factory that you want

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,480
to have

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,600
and if you achieve that in the first

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
step of the

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,959
industry 4.0 um you can get

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,320
a visibility of your assets of your

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,639
machines on the shop floor

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
which you before didn't have a lot of

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,600
times we talked to customers

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,720
and they do a lot of decisions based on

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,920
gut feelings

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
um on their

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,680
years long years that they're working

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,639
already they know

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,480
a lot of things intuitively but here in

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,519
the first step if you have the data

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
visibility

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,079
you can see what is actually really

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,360
happening based on data on your

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,720
shop flow and in the second step after

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,519
you have

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
this visibility and see it over time and

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,240
maybe look

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,399
uh what happened actually before for

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
example there was a defect in the

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,200
machine

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,720
you get this transparency and you can

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,880
actually understand

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
why is something happening what happened

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,680
um at certain points of time

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
and if you have done that then you can

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,959
go actually

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,040
in the third step to predict also

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,560
what what will happen you can be

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,200
prepared better you can

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
do things like for example maintenance

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
that you

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,320
actually don't wait till a certain uh

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
part is worn out at your machine but

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,240
then

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,040
you can predict when that will happen

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
and to do a maintenance beforehand and

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,440
in this way

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,440
um don't have costly stops of your

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
entire machine

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,199
and then in the fourth step for example

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,639
the way you could go is then also the

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,279
optimization the self

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,160
adaptility and the activity of the

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
machines

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,560
so um if you have certain parts where

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,959
the machines on the shop floor

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
uh see that for example there would be a

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,399
queue in the production line

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,240
or there there's one machine that

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
doesn't have any capabilities at the

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
moment

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,639
you could rearrange by yourself the

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,920
production

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,519
workflow of your product and very

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,720
important that is of course

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,880
like technical steps you can take in the

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,839
direction of industry 4.0

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,600
but um for all companies not only the

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,720
machine manufacturers but also the

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
factory owners

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,240
of course uh it is important then also

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
to think

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
about how can that bring more money how

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
can that bring

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,920
new digital business models how can they

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,199
gain more customers

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,720
with digitalization so um for

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,959
for the companies itself of course um

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,760
such an investment in digitalization

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,120
also needs

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
a respective return and through these

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,800
steps

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,800
to the digitalization they are often the

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,519
basis that you actually can do

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,600
new business models for example if you

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,959
know exactly

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,800
what kind of gases what kind or how much

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,959
electricity did you use

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
to cut a certain part you have a much

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,079
better

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,360
possibility to calculate your prices and

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,839
then also

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,680
connect your machines for example uh to

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
a production sharing platform

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,759
where you can offer or do the offers

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
your pricing

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:41,839
uh much more based on real data than on

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,839
the gut feelings

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,959
okay uh in the second slide so if you

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:54,160
want to have such an iot solution um

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:57,120
how do what kind of um

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,040
layers or what kind of technical

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,079
challenges do you actually have to

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,360
tackle in such an iot architecture

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,519
and here is a typical

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,199
four layer architecture there are three

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,759
four five layer architectures if you

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,360
look

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,800
um into different papers

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,600
but this is a typical one

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,320
on the perception layer there you

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
actually

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
have to see how do you actually get the

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
data that you want to have i will go

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,199
into detail

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,519
in a few slides there then if you have

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,279
the the data that you want to have or

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,279
that you need for your solution

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,360
on the network layer you of course have

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,199
to bring these data from the different

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,000
machines from the different gateways

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,639
uh together either locally on the edge

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,920
or

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,199
in the cloud platform and then um on the

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,680
third layer on the middle

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,800
aware layer you have to process the data

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,759
you have to store it you have to

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
aggregate it

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,240
you have to have apis for example for

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,759
the highest level then the application

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
layer where you

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,040
that where you are actually on the usage

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,880
layers where you um

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,079
we present this information where you

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,480
have dashboards where

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,919
for example applications which use the

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
data that you

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,919
achieved on the shop floor and so on so

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,000
that is

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,039
the basic theoretical architecture

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,240
which we use as a basis for our solution

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,280
of industry so let's have a look

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,720
um here we also see an overview

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,320
of industry fusion as i said

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,640
already we focus then specifically

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,720
on this slide before on how can we do

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
an open solution which is vendor

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,880
independent

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,200
to get this basic connectivity on the

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,400
shop floor bring the data together

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,280
and offer it then on the highest level

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
like to an ecosystem of applications

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
services

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
platforms whatever you want to build on

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,360
top of that

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,080
so the challenge on the perception layer

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
as i said already there is a very

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,120
heterogeneous

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,720
shop floor uh usually in the factories

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,720
you have old machines you have new

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,600
machines you have different types

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,679
of control systems you have different

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,160
protocols which these machines

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
are speaking and all of that in the

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,640
first step

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,280
you have to challenge and get the data

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
out of this

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,840
and these different machines um after

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,160
you've done that

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,160
you have you have the raw data of the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,080
machines and you have to

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,280
bring this data actually on a higher

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,400
level um

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,880
to have the information

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
which is behind this data so you have to

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
have media information

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,720
what does the data that you get out of

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,799
the machines actually mean

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,760
what kind of information is stored for

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,080
example

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
is it the temperature is it the pressure

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,679
is it the

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,799
energy consumption whatever um in which

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
unit is it

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,160
received by the machines how often does

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
the machine send it and so on

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
so you need all this information um also

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
to have

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,039
the basic information how you can

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,360
process this data

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,080
and then after you have such a

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
common uh semantic model of your

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,559
information

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,880
then you of course have to bring the

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
information from the different machines

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
together

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,160
and there from the beginning on we also

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,440
said we want to have a solution

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,679
which you can run either locally on an

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
edge server in your

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,600
in your factory on-premises or if you

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,840
want to

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:48,240
run it in at any cloud service provider

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,200
and based on these levels then of course

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,160
the dashboards applications and so on on

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
top of

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,880
these data so if we go uh

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,679
one step deeper and have a look um

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,600
at the the perception layer so how the

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,720
information is retrieved

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
from the different machines and here i

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
have

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,080
two typical examples that we

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,120
experience often at customer facilities

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,080
on the upper level we have the plc based

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,960
approach so

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,480
program logical control based approach

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,000
siemens in europe is

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,760
very dominant here which has the control

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,200
systems for the machines

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,480
and there we integrated apache

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,520
project plc for x to actually

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,440
receive the information for example

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,520
from the different plcs here

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
on the shop floor level on the lower

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,240
level you see also

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,000
a variant which we use if we have for

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,400
example an old machine or a machine

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,600
which is totally unlocked nowadays

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,440
um the other gateway directly

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,400
is connected to different sensors which

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
bring the information which is required

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,039
uh

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,520
for uh the solution so that is something

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,640
which

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,720
um happens uh on the

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,080
vendor side on the manufacturer uh

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,200
specific side and

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,559
that's some language of course

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,720
will stay uh very specific depending

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,400
uh on the machine depending on how the

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,640
software of the manufacturer

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,600
is written internally and um

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,480
yeah of course uh that that can vary

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
between

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,159
um the different manufacturers but then

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,360
um on the

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,480
right hand side on the blue side there

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,640
we have then

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,200
uh this uh inter uh manufacturer

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,120
or cross manufacturer interoperability

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
through the common semantic model so

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
there

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,919
the and i wrote it uh below the picture

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,400
um we don't have any more of this data

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,559
but we standardized the data and

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,880
brought it up to another level that we

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,440
really have uh the information

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,080
from various different machines in the

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,280
same

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,760
representative form so we know exactly

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,760
okay this is a representation of the

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,039
temperature it is measured in degrees

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,799
celsius

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
and you receive it for example every

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,280
second formulation

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,960
and based on that then of course

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,760
applications are not

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,400
any more specific to one machine or only

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
bound

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,679
to the information from one machine but

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,640
then can use it

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,760
in a cross-manufacture way and uh to

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,240
decisions or

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,000
whatever the application does basically

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,320
if you also remember back to the

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,600
picture of the factory where we showed

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,159
the different

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,240
types of machines yeah it's much easier

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,720
to build business models on that

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,720
that are truly easily and

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,919
can easily be rolled out in the factory

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,240
and also can be easily scaled

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,559
since you have all this semantic issue

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
already

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,559
good so let's have a short view on

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,360
how we did the deployment of industry

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,960
fusion

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,480
here um we have actually a totally

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,640
uh kubernetes based approach and

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,600
um on the shop floor level so on the

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
different

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,720
machines which are connected to a

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,080
gateway we have

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,120
a local k3s cluster on the shop floor

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,039
so each machine each gateway represents

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,480
a node in the local

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,200
cluster on which then the pot which

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,159
actually has

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,000
three functionalities is running so the

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,039
first functionality is

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
receiving the data from the machine as

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,159
we saw in the slide before

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,919
either through plc through mqtt or pcua

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,200
whatever is the connectivity possibility

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,559
you have

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,200
for your machine then the second part is

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,440
to bring this data in the common

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,679
semantic model so to translate

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,120
this data to the information you need

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,320
and then third step the

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,880
oesp agent so the agent that

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,919
is responsible for the connectivity on

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,559
the higher level

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,000
is running on each of the nodes and then

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,320
the higher level so that

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,240
the factory level which either as i said

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,080
can run on an edge server or at the

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,120
cloud service provider

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,400
there a kubernetes cluster is running um

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,120
which has the opposite side of the oep

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,039
agent so

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,080
the osp master where the communication

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,159
happens between the different gateways

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,159
and

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,240
the factory level we have our middleware

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,159
there where muscle in the next slides

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,880
will go into detail uh

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,080
and on top of that so all the data

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,440
storage

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,159
data aggregation and so on and then we

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,960
have

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,400
um as a second part um our fusion

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,200
backend and front end

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,840
where you can see the data where you

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,039
have already different possibilities

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,360
to save information about your

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,600
shop floor about your factory how it is

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
built up which factory sites you have

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
which rooms you have which machines you

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
have and so

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,919
on so you have already this first

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,840
transparency

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,919
of your factory and of course then you

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,520
have apis where different third-party

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,120
applications

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,880
can run on and can be used

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,000
yeah the data can be used that you can

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,880
receive from the machines

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,760
and with that i want to hand over to

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,720
marcel

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,600
um who will go now into some details of

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,720
the middleware

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,820
that we implemented from using the date

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
okay yeah thanks constantine so

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,559
[Music]

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,320
yeah we designed and

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,200
added the middleware to this project

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
and here are a list of our design

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,679
principles

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,159
um so well i mean since

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,520
constantine mentioned it already um the

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,880
requirement from

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,120
industry business network was everything

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,679
everything should be open source

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,240
but even if you talk about open source

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,400
there are

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:24,000
different flavors right and we said um

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,720
it's ideal to bet on

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,080
open source projects which are developed

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,520
in an open source

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,880
body like apache eclipse

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,080
of course and the concepts

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,440
we are using uh it should be coming

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,000
from a more have a large community a

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,919
higher maturity where those having

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,400
specialized solutions which are

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,919
pretty new but very tough to operate

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,240
them

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,360
and we decided also to go with the

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,919
apache 2.0

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,960
license where this is applicable of

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,960
course

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,159
um i mean there might be cases where

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,520
other licensed uh

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,279
licenses are acceptable um but then

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,799
we have to make sure that everything

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,360
fits together

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,120
so what we wanted to achieve was a fully

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,919
open source

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,000
framework including testing scaling high

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,799
availability and

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,600
operation of this life cycle management

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,159
of this

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,919
what does it mean i mean people looking

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,159
at open source they would say well that

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,840
applies to every open source project but

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
if you look at

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,360
there's a variety of open source

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,559
projects solving a lot of

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,120
aspects of iot for sure but then

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,080
uh then you realize that uh for instance

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,880
some of them are

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,000
telling you yeah here's a nice docker

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,080
example

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,520
and uh you know good luck with scaling

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,360
it up uh

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
and doing the life cycle management and

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,520
this is of course

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,960
creating you know i would say the

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,480
largest amount of

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,360
the work you have to put into such a

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,440
framework or in other frameworks you see

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,600
in other open source frameworks yeah

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,320
yeah you get the base version but but if

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,360
you want to

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,760
get serious if you want to you know be

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,760
get higher availability features and

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,880
and scaling features then you know come

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,919
to my

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,120
commercial and offering that and we

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,480
didn't want to go that way

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:26,320
so we selected frameworks which

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,760
are providing um exactly

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,360
in this respect the the best

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,080
how are you the best return of invest um

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,880
also considering that we are a small

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,399
team

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,640
and we want to develop something which

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:45,200
runs in the cloud

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,760
but also on the edge we decided to say

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,760
we developed everything native uh on

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,720
kubernetes so everything

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,679
uh for run on any managed kubernetes

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,760
platform

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,840
and also on every edge platform which

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,279
provides your fully

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:05,120
compatible kubernetes

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:08,240
like for instance k3s and

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,960
so this helped us in

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,559
in our assumption that we can develop it

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,080
once

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,320
and develop it everywhere

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,120
for instance you know develop it with a

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
cloud first

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
microservice paradigm but also moving

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,080
move it

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,530
to the edge and um that is the

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,000
one of the principles next slide piece

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,880
[Music]

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,240
yeah i mean look at this is a high level

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,559
uh

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,279
overview over the components we are

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,799
using

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,080
so to the left you see the

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,520
devices but also the

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,600
applications which are currently

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,320
developed in industry fusion and in

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
case they wanted to get to access into

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,159
iot data

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,960
they access either a rest box in mqtt

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,679
proxy

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,960
or broker or a websocket server

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,799
and in this case the mqd

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,919
broker is mokito-based and the rest

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,360
and websocket server are node

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,880
jets and express frameworks

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,880
and to do the authentication and the

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,679
authorization we used key cloak so

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
this integrated in all those frameworks

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,880
and

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,880
um to make sure we have a single sign on

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,799
also with all the applications

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
which are developed for our synthetic

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,039
diffusion

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,559
and then every data which is sent is no

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,440
surprise

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,000
pushed to a kafka broker which is here a

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,679
very central component for everything

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,080
and um the structured data is managed

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,360
with

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,640
postgres database with database and

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,399
the the let's say catch

00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,559
caching and the rate control

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,320
um so that not one service is taking too

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,880
much much bandwidth for instance

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:10,559
is done with the ready service after

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,559
there are two

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,559
frameworks that say one is the

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,200
storage back-end which is

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,559
supporting um hbase open it is the time

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
series database

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,640
uh which is using cassandra and rtb and

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,760
mini i o

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,559
for um

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,600
min io for binary data for instance or

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,559
for cases where

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,159
one of those time series database is not

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,880
supporting all kinds of

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,880
data for much

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,799
and what runs today and

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,600
and then on the upper side you see um

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,919
the link

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,990
a cluster which is running the services

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,000
so we run services like

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:05,120
[Music]

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,880
a rule engine a pre-aggregation

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,279
of data state aggregation or

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
calculation of additional aggregated

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,519
functions

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,760
for the machines and

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,000
machine health check you can also do

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,559
inferencing

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,679
and uh can can you hear me i hope yes

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,440
inferencing and of course

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,559
every um third-party framework

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,559
okay next slide please

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,960
so i mentioned that we wanted to develop

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,080
this framework in a way

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,919
that uh whatever we do we it runs in in

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,880
the cloud and on the edge

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,320
um that means we need to do to bring the

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,600
cloud to the edge

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,519
and in order to do that uh we

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,279
are using an open source project called

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,799
stylingx which is developed by an

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,240
openstack

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,519
and this framework is making sure that

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,039
you have all the cloud

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,080
frameworks but on a on a local edge

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,120
server for instance

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,720
it provides you high availability um it

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,880
provides you also stuff you

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,760
you want or functions you want to have

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,640
in a

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,880
uh on an edge service which for instance

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
is

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,960
a low latency so it is the architecture

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
is very

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,279
of course displayed here high level but

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,159
it all starts with a low latency linux

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,360
which can even

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,399
preempt rt linux

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,679
and this on on top of this there are

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,399
several services um seth for instance

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,679
uh runs distributed on this platform so

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,720
you can for instance

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,200
run uh deploy it on on two or three or

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,200
four or more

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,679
devices and then it's distributing

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,120
um and then on the next layer you have

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,799
the styling x

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,799
services which is for instance the

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,600
manage of the software of the host

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,960
upgrades what happens in cases of falls

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,280
and so on okay i need to speed up a

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,280
little bit

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,159
and then on top you have kubernetes and

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,639
everything around kubernetes

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,480
and if you need virtualization which is

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,079
very often in those environments

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,800
you can put on top of commodity as a

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,480
full open experiment

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
with different hypervisors okay next

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
slide

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,720
so putting everything on kubernetes

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,440
sounds very

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,560
you know trivial and straightforward but

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,760
actually

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,520
um there are problems um and

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,359
i try to make it very very quick when

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,399
you look at some things like for

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,760
instance kafka

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,560
or cassandra so in the bootstrap process

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,000
typically the clients get a list of ip

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
addresses

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,240
and to understand

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,040
where the service is running where i get

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,160
for instance my backup if the main

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,599
service is down

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,160
and so on and what are we observe

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,240
especially in those environments that

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,000
this works very nicely when for instance

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,240
you work with little machines because if

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,160
one node goes down

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,920
then the assumption that if this node

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,000
comes up um

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
the ip address is the same is valid

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,880
right but when you go to kubernetes

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,119
that's not no longer valid

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,280
so for instance if you if a client gets

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,240
three ip addresses uh of services and

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,240
one node goes down

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,680
comes up again but it has a different ip

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,200
address that's you know something you

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,119
can't change in kubernetes

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,320
and this is creating some problems but

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,520
this can of course be

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,800
resolved with several concepts um

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,280
even though more or less what is assumed

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,599
that the client and the servers are

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
controlled the servers are services is

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,119
controlled by operators

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,640
and the client is realizing that it lost

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,640
the connection to the service and is

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,030
restarting

00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,499
okay i can

00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,499
[Music]

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,040
only five minutes to go uh so we just

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,079
want to give a few

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,720
more pictures here um on on in this

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
effusion

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,960
in usage you see here already in the

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,119
background our machine which is

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,880
cutting the real metal and that is

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,520
something which i want to

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,920
emphasize here once more that of course

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,800
um

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,200
with all the data flowing and running up

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,960
there

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,640
it's at the end always also a real

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,040
process behind there

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,000
um real machines real sensors which of

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,960
course also

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
have their uh specific issues and um

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,200
which have to be taken into account in

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,200
such a solution

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,480
so uh here once more just some

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,320
screenshots um

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,920
what you saw on the last slide in our

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,640
competence center here

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,560
um we have uh the the six machines

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,839
connected which are standing

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,280
here at each of those um has a gateway

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,680
as you can see on the right hand side

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,400
connected to it um each gateway

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,720
represents one node in this case

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,760
cluster one of them is a master node and

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,880
the other ones

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,160
um are connected then uh to this cluster

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,400
and on each of these different

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
gateways then the pot which i showed to

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,520
you

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,560
with the connectivity uh towards the

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,800
machine

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,560
is running receiving the information and

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,680
the oesp agent

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,200
it connects them to the platform which

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,400
in our case is running at the cloud

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,440
service provider

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,920
um but as marcel said it was good to run

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,640
locally which we will do uh one of the

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,760
next steps

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,520
uh to run it completely here ultimate

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,880
horseshoe

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,280
well maybe then a look to the ux

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,560
we used here and the user interfaces

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,240
that we built within industry fusion

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,280
most of the time industrial software

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,800
yeah sorry to say that uh tends to be

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,839
pretty ugly

00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,880
but we think that also here in

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,920
parts of the ux we truly have to give

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,520
the users

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,520
no matter if they are from the industry

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,560
or some uh

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,880
consumers um yeah basically that

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,440
that stuff that they are also used from

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,640
cell phones uh many other platforms and

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,160
the other software so yeah we also

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,920
put big emphasize on um making industry

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,920
fusion really usable

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,040
um for what i ended up using here yeah

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,440
and that's basically

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,480
a little overview of the machines that

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,920
are

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,839
connected here within um the association

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,800
showroom which is actually here behind

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,920
us we would

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,720
love to show you that but yeah um

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,040
probably one week sure but if anybody is

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,800
interested of course uh reach out

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,920
to us we're happy to to show you them

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,200
uh also um here in the real showroom

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,320
so uh yeah this already once again

00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,880
i i am on the last slide now uh

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,640
so the key takeaways actually from our

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,440
side of the presentation is

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,400
that industry 4.0 from a small but also

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,160
from a big company

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,240
actually never can be solved by a single

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,839
manufacturer as it's always about

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,240
interoperability between different

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,800
machines between different manufacturers

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,400
um between different facilities that

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,280
have to work together so

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,839
uh open solutions um are actually the

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,640
key

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,000
uh to a cross manufacturing variability

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,320
and industry fusion

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,599
is here a solution that really offers uh

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,560
the basis for such

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,960
an uh vendor-independent ecosystem on

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
which

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,640
different services different new

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,359
business models can be done on

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,200
uh it's a kubernetes-based approach with

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,480
our principle that we want to develop at

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,560
once that we can deploy

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
everywhere that we have one interface

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,680
where you can manage

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
all your different devices all your

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,800
different machines

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,560
and the cloud platform platform for your

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,119
factory

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,160
that's the current status where we're uh

00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,599
at the moment

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,680
of course there are also next steps

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,240
which are planned already

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,319
um we found it uh in the fusion

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,960
foundation as a legal entity of industry

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,400
fusion

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,800
uh to us the code and to bring all the

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,480
different partners in this ecosystem

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,640
together which will be growing now in

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,480
the next month uh we will of course

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,280
extend the framework with further

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,680
features

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,520
uh for the different customers for the

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,440
machine manufacturers that they're

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,720
more easily can connect their machines

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,319
for the factory

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,560
operators that they have already more

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,520
dashboards directly integrated

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,160
and of course we are also not solely in

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,640
the world

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,520
and we will also align of course to

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,960
other

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,040
open initiatives for example gaia x here

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,319
in europe is a very interesting

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,280
uh project now running for a few months

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,680
uh regarding data sovereignty and there

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,800
we will align of course also our

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,200
activities towards

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,680
that and then of course we have our

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,119
competence center here but we deploy

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,160
also industry fusion

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,720
at real production facilities at

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,880
customer factories to improve the

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,040
scalability to see how it is running

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
in a real production facility in a two

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,599
two shift or three shift

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,960
um uh environment and

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,240
to really improve the scalability

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,680
so um we would be very happy if you

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,319
joined innocent fusion

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,680
uh you can visit uh the websites of

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,960
industry fusion and also

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,760
get up of uh esp um

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,200
for the iot middleware and of course we

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,680
would be very happy

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,640
to work with you together if you support

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,960
us

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,440
in this challenge of the democratization

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,040
of industry 4.0

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,400
with that we want to say thank you and

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,640
if there are questions we're happy to

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,040
answer them otherwise just reach out to

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,720
us

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,400
and we're happy to answer them

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,800
afterwards thank you very much thank you

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
very much

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,839
all right thank you all um our next talk

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,480
is going to be patrick viner

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,440
with apache steam pipes flexible

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,200
industrial iot management

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,599
so if um everybody from the industry

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:26,079
fusion wants to do the leave thing

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:26,079
