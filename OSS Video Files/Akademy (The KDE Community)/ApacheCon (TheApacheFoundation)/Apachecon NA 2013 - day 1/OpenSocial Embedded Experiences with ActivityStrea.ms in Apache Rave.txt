that's not anyway so I'm Matt Franklin

00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,089
and I'm I'm going to talk to you about a

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,580
daily experiences and for everybody I

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,030
don't know hi it's nice to meet you so

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,650
it's like to you so so when I talk about

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,389
I'll get a little bit of an introduction

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,000
we'll talk about what OpenSocial is what

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,830
they're doing currently Apache rave and

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,180
embed experiences and I promise all of

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,300
those things will make sense when we're

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,660
done a little bit about me I'm Matt

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,160
Franklin from The MITRE corporation I'm

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,929
the current pmc chair for Apache rave

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,079
I'm an asf member and i'm also open

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:38,219
social foundation number so OpenSocial

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,250
some of you may have heard of a social

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,660
before some of you may not have heard of

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,040
OpenSocial before for those of you have

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,420
you've probably heard it in the context

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,309
of Google unless you've been

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,410
specifically working with OpenSocial in

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,280
last couple of years OpenSocial is not

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,110
Google and it's a it was originally

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,090
started the foundation was started by

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,510
Google but has moved on and we're kind

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,500
of taking it to the next step so we're

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,260
going to talk a little bit about I

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,489
thought I got rid of animation we're

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,900
going to talk about what OpenSocial is

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,330
really so open source is really two

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,970
different pieces it's a modular web

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,380
application development framework so

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,700
gadget widget you know whatever you

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,280
whatever term you really want to use

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,590
we're starting to call them apps in the

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,970
open social space that because that fits

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,210
with every other at market and

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,680
everything else that you have but open

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,509
social apps are haven't you know pretty

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,439
much a simple manifest HTML and

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,030
JavaScript front-end runtime HTTP proxy

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,579
that lets you get back to back end

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,689
services supports Roth 10 a and 2

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,549
authorization and authentication back to

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,189
those services and then a whole bunch of

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,200
client API is that could get a allow you

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,909
to do cool stuff like launch other

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,710
gadgets interact with them over a pub

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,479
sub channel and get access to data it

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,119
also is a specification for for the

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,860
social data API so you know first and

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,770
foremost in this is person information

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,030
so you want to know about the person

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,280
who's viewing it information about the

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,259
subject of the page also who they're

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,479
connected to so in a business census

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,640
would be people they follow people in

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,160
the organization and a social sense it's

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,280
probably

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,440
the friends you can get similar to to a

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,240
Facebook model and also the activity

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,160
streams so we'll talk a little bit more

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,600
about what activity streams are but the

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,700
most important thing to take home from

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,820
this slide is that that activity streams

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,710
are first-class citizen OpenSocial we

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,600
also have our pies for media items and

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,810
messages and a few others that are

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,400
probably not quite as widely used as

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,550
activity streams and people but they do

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,330
serve a form of flexion I swear I

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,830
deleted those animations so color what's

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,630
the advantage of OpenSocial why would

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,790
you want to develop something inside of

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,900
it so credibility right that's first and

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,910
foremost with any type of which a

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,930
framework the portability across the

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,550
different containers so i can write

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,460
something for that works in rave that

00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,380
also works in jive or IBM connections or

00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,790
any of the other OpenSocial containers

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,380
that that are accessible to me client

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,940
integration so this one's a really big

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,500
one for us at mitre applications that

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,360
you have certain access to all the

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,550
services via that runtime proxy that are

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,100
on the network so what you can start to

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,980
put together is a composite user

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,660
interface that does kind of integrate to

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,310
the client level so each gadget can

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,830
access one or two services that it needs

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,740
to to get its data and do what it needs

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,700
to with that data and then instead of

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,230
having to do a big server-side

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,760
integration and then right or a web page

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,750
like you kind of traditionally did you

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,270
can kind of bring those different

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,160
components to the UI component you I to

00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,500
the front end and let the browser just

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,270
kind of render them independently and

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,120
then use it take advantage of the

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,150
client-side API is like pops up to push

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,370
messages and events around another huge

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,670
advantages for us and that we use a lot

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,550
is in the injection of the runtime AP

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,989
ice so as opposed to some of the widget

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,150
affray mercs that are out there there's

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,130
a government one specifically where you

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,840
to include api's you literally have to

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,840
reference the javascript file that lives

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,360
on the server OpenSocial provides you a

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,850
way to say I just need this right I need

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,250
this particular feature to be there let

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,049
me have it and you do that as part of

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,160
the manifest is very declarative there's

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,650
a lot of run

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,150
I'm efficiency can kind of can cancel

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,470
concatenates all jobs go up together

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,720
sent it down as a single bundle so this

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,070
theoretically and in practice for the

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,870
most part should simplify your

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,550
development if you're doing it right all

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,590
right so it gives you you know your

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,050
cloak code doesn't have to do a ton it

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,430
only has to do take advantage or do it

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,650
only lies is responsible for the things

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,120
that it needs to to get its particular

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,700
function done versus some of the other

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,920
AP is all right I don't have to work

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,600
hard to go back in get person data I

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,460
don't have to work hard to make a you

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,010
know create a pub sub mechanism right i

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,890
just say attached to the hub and you

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,150
know senator then so and then the next

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,640
thing that OpenSocial is really starting

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,010
to push towards is the concept of an in

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,140
context application what this means is

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,270
delivering him you see people as an

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,490
integration point a lot of that has to

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,430
do with with how activity streams are

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,320
being used with OpenSocial now and what

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,660
we want to do is deliver actual

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,000
functionality to the users where they

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,460
are right so wherever they are whatever

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,690
application there in allow you know

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,070
things like activity streams to

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,330
transport applications around so that

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,190
people can take advantage of them

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,320
without having to switch contacts out to

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,400
some new window or a different

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,310
application so what you kind of see is

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,230
how OpenSocial evolved from where it

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,000
started as just the google gadgets back

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,110
out to where we're headed to wear than

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,200
you know what they call apps at the

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,450
point of need right you know started the

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,310
formal specification of servlets

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,770
portlets you know those types of you

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,910
know big heavy weight specifications

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,790
kind of combining with the lighter

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,620
weight you know bottle of iframes and

00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,480
what you kind of see in facebook apps to

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,490
start to put together html5 components

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,500
and then now we're going to start to

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,580
deliver apps at the point of need so

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,050
we'll talk a little bit about how that

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,760
happens and that's kind of really what

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,160
an embedded experience is so I'll get

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,350
into the more but a little bit later but

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,180
the overall goal is to kind of reduce

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,130
the context switch you don't want to

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,730
take your users out of where there you

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,960
are and to you know take some action on

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,640
some other application you want to be

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,180
able to let them do it right there in

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,370
line and move forward and also you know

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,080
this model really supports you know a

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,460
development pattern that is pretty

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
pervasive right so rest services are

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,639
every

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,110
ap is are all over the place so taking

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,050
advantage of those with just straight

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,090
HTML and JavaScript web apps that run on

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,070
the client side is really kind of one of

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,389
the goals of OpenSocial in terms of

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:51,510
supporting that so this is fun better

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,510
about OpenSocial and apache Wraith so

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,270
apache rave is is the project that I'm I

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,650
work on the most but for those of you

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,490
who don't know what apache rave is which

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:05,910
is like two of you apache wave is a web

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,389
and social mashup engine its job is to

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:13,020
manage the little web widgets or I said

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,330
whether they be don't open social or w3c

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,979
widgets it doesn't matter could have

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,410
additional ones as well if you wanted to

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,919
raise job is to make sure that they show

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:27,030
up in the right place on the page and

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,470
are consistently defined we also support

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,970
a lot of different deployment scenarios

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,770
so so task focused dashboards is

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,710
something that that we do a lot of with

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,180
right where you can imagine you know you

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,220
say you're the Department of Energy and

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,840
you have a big map that shows all of

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,039
your smart grid stuff and you have a

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,550
bunch of widgets on the outside of that

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,400
map that have context based information

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,710
so whether it be I click on a on you

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,180
know Aaron's house and I see all the

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,590
usage that he's had in the last month

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,020
and maybe I have a graph below that

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,460
shows a trend over time and then I see

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,080
another network graph to see how many

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,870
people in his neighborhood that that

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,330
have similar usage right all those types

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,830
of situational awareness dashboards can

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,650
really take advantage of the lightweight

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,970
widget model very easily component web

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,800
application so this is something we do a

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,419
lot of mitre we we have recently

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,490
deployed a really big application where

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,979
we replace our phone book which the

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,229
phone book at mitre is about 15

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,910
different data sources all composed into

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,650
a single single web page and what we

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,419
used to do was make 15 different web

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,880
service calls on the server side and the

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,740
render out of JSP with all that data so

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,710
now what we do is just render out via

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,570
rave the the context and let the gadgets

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,479
themselves go back out to the services

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,169
and get the data and render and we also

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,190
have an intern intranet portal and an

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,640
extranet portal that we're putting

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,890
together

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,460
if the internet portal we had for a

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,290
while the extranet is new but those are

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,640
kind of how we get our users engaged

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:58,020
when they you load up their web pages

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:59,550
for the day so core features OpenSocial

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,380
supposed to be a patchy shindig so we

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,670
don't we didn't rewrite the book right

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,900
we just took Apache shindig and all the

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,380
good stuff that they've done and

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,840
integrated it we support w3c widgets the

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,520
Apache wookie so same model right we

00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,680
didn't want to have to rewrite a whole

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,230
w3c widget container so we just took out

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,660
advantage of work ahead and we include

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,330
them all you know barely in a loosely

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,710
coupled architecture we rave does

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,420
provide some of the OpenSocial spi

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,640
implementations so for activity streams

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,020
and people so that you know kind of at

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,420
least out of the box and have a starting

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,110
point to work towards a kind of

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,730
integrated environment we have a little

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,350
bit of a salsa versus application

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,910
administration can give in to the an

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,200
admin section and set some preferences

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,490
for expanding on that yeah very quickly

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,840
got your repository so some of you seen

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,340
widget stores and things like that so

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,170
this is the same concept right you can

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,320
go into the gadget store add new gadgets

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,880
add them to your page okay so good we

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,280
also have support for inter widget

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,080
communication across the different types

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,300
of widgets so you can actually do pub

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,490
sub from OpenSocial gadget to it will

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,850
keep widget something that is kind of

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,780
unique we do have a plugin persistence

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,370
model so you can provide your own

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,260
implementations of our repositories to

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,240
get you have source your data from

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,860
wherever you need to and we have a

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,780
pluggable although probably a little

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,450
overly complex right now security model

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,860
where you can you take advantage of

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:25,770
spring plugins so raise support for

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,910
OpenSocial is is you know wait wave

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,680
itself as I had mentioned before is

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,480
widget agnostic it shouldn't really care

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,520
but we do have a pretty good delegate

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,280
model and we these providers provide

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,870
some great functionality and anything

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,340
that is useful in common we've kind of

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,290
abstract it out so any widget framework

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,730
can take advantage of it but the

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,110
OpenSocial providers specifically gives

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,840
you your activity streams integration

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,090
the open Ajax hub inner gadget

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,890
communication embedded experiences and

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,920
view targets and open gadget I'll show

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,540
you what they learn

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,800
so this I'd be to the point of this

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,290
architecture slide this was done for an

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,020
internal review but the point of this is

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,210
to kind of show that that the red parts

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,160
are pieces that come from you know the

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,380
providers themselves so shindig is you

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,060
know the big red box on the top we have

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,070
a little bit of a red piece inside of

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,590
rave that just kind of isn't the adapter

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,630
for that particular widget framework and

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,490
now on the client time client-side

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,170
runtime we have the we use this shindig

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,130
common container to launch the widgets

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:27,830
and gadgets so i'm going to show you

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:31,010
real quick since talking doesn't do very

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:35,280
do it much justice i'll show you the

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:39,300
resize my browser okay everybody can see

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,060
that okay kinda so where is that you

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,920
know it's a simple web app the this is

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,690
the default portal layout begin have

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,680
different kinds of layouts this portal

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,820
layout allows you to have multiple tabs

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,310
and you can create the user to create

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,250
tabs each each kind of user gets their

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,730
own context or tab set the week all

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,170
pages because a couple example gadget so

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,030
you know we support dragging and

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,320
dropping of persisting of the the

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:08,850
locations you can minimize maximize have

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,020
a context menu that you can do different

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,960
things like we've gadgets to different

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:16,230
pages delete it off the page all those

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:19,010
fun stuff this is the opening gadget API

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,510
so this one's kind of something that I

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,010
really like to see a lot of we take

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,070
advantage of this a lot in type internal

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:28,710
tomato but you can open a that same

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,420
gadget in a different view so the I'm

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,950
here I'm opening in the sidebar you can

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,210
pass context back and forth as you

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,560
launch it so all right so I can sit

00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,600
there and you know patent set and send

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,360
that back down to the client or to the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,280
other gadget and all this is

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,540
fundamentally OpenSocial gadgets are I

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,840
frame so right so this is all happening

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,370
across an RPC layer so that it's all

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,380
abstract until you don't have to deal

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,130
with it dialogue same type of thing and

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,480
verbal are pretty much the same thing

00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,430
right now I don't think we have too much

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,680
difference between the two but you could

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,540
if you wanted to we're working to kind

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,760
of break out some of the client side you

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,290
I so it's even more sense

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,990
simply with canvas right so canvas lets

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,750
you open it in kind of a maximized view

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:18,040
you can go change different views with

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:21,250
parameters set it back home and then

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,810
example of a so if I subscribe in this

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,060
widget to the to the channel and I

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,190
publish it here you can see you know

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,190
client-side communications across an

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,810
open Ajax hub so that one's kind of fun

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,330
we get to do some fun things a binary

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,340
you actually use that for control flow

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,290
we enable and disable edit modes based

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:42,220
on that it's kind of neat to see just

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:45,550
all but Nyssa taneously pop a rib also

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,920
supports like I said the widget store so

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,140
you can come in here rate your widgets

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,900
you can comment on them add them to your

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,270
page so if I wanted to add you know the

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,600
current schedule i could see who's using

00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:04,780
it search for different widgets on the

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:07,300
store pretty simple admin interface so

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,710
you can manage your users the widgets

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,210
you can set different properties on them

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:14,140
and control whether they're published or

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:18,610
not to the to the wider user base set

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:21,520
some portal preferences and then we also

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,960
have a profile view which will have a

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,130
big discussion at the hackathon about

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,040
how we kind of make this a little bit

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:30,850
more generic and then this today but the

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,870
profile view is a kind of what we use

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,520
internally from writer for our phone

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,190
book right so these gadgets you can see

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,740
what I wanted them about this is the

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,570
rave has the ability to turn off the

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,610
chrome to turn off the ability to move

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,260
stuff inside of the different regions of

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,390
gadgets and it's all driven by the

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:51,580
database so so that's Apache Rafe in a

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:56,680
nutshell it's pretty easy to deal with

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:58,830
it's not a lot of conceptual difficulty

00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,830
there

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:11,160
alright so now the meat of this

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,690
discussion it better the experiences so

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,390
that has anybody have any idea of what

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,540
an embedded experiences is just raise

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,560
your hand other than correct right so

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,690
it's one of those things that's really

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,640
hard to name and when you come up with a

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,279
name like invited experiences it sounds

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,040
very buzz-worthy and it doesn't really

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,050
tell you what it does but for at least

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,610
four what I see it's one of its a

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,210
critical enabling technology for our

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,250
enterprise a lot of you should have

00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,350
heard from your users about the too many

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,550
tool problem too many tools I have to go

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,560
here for this I'm gonna go there for

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,360
that I've got to go you know like i said

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,370
it minor earlier we have about you know

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,500
200 different places to do everything if

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,000
you really you know count out every

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,730
little tool that everybody uses all day

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,720
long and it's just impossible to manage

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,920
all that in an effective way so we're

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,500
looking to a better that experiences to

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,630
help us that with that and to do that

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,260
you kind of have to embrace a stream

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,200
metaphor for your business so people are

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,770
our street-based right and we get our

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,690
situational awareness from a stream

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,800
metaphor you know very easily so stock

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,210
ticker sure we've had stock tickers

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,730
forever just you know flying across the

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,050
board and that's how everybody keeps

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,430
uploaded on what stocks are sure you can

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,160
go query it but a lot of times you just

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,860
look it up and seeing what's new email

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,300
is a stream based entity right so emails

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,310
come in you handle them you manage them

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,570
you move on Twitter feeds facebook

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,520
timelines all you can think of all these

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,800
different metaphors of how you you

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,300
interact with stream based data today

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,410
and then if you actually talk about you

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,330
know so what am i doing that I was

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,310
speaking at a conference right and if I

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,510
tell somebody that when i go back what

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,980
did you do last week I spoke at a

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,770
conference you're using that kind of

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,070
that event based model to describe how

00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:55,020
you interact with the world so if

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,779
businesses and developers were to

00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,310
embrace this fact then you can throw

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,770
applications to take advantage of the

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,750
users kind of natural model for

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,390
perceiving the world so farm bill right

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,740
so how did Fargo get popular everybody

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,360
started using it it showed up in their

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,370
facebook timelines and they're in their

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,540
facebook news feeds and then the whole

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,000
world uses farm bill

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,770
it's a time suck for half the companies

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,430
in the world is charging you know people

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,120
charged in time to play farmville and

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,940
you're starting to see a lot of

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,860
applications especially in enterprise

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,530
take advantage of the stream based

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,720
metaphor every major social network

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,360
using streams right so well that's just

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,220
what they weather is Pinterest or

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,810
Facebook or Twitter all of them have a

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,940
stream metaphor that they were dealing

00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,080
with and business business applications

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,700
are starting to as well but the business

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,580
applications are doing it an isolated

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,470
you know silos they're building the

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,090
streams and the stream based stuff for

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,720
themselves and that doesn't really help

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,790
anybody alright so i'm going to show you

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,460
this this is the fun part of the demo

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,410
listen to me talk is never fun so them i

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,000
don't thank you for bearing bearing with

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,310
that part but i'm going to kind of show

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,680
you what a traditional social network

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,440
kind of activity stream might look like

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,270
if i can get the demo to run so this is

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,930
running on my local laptop that is just

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,460
horribly slow so i apologize actually

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:21,230
does anybody have a mac charger that

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,230
they can swim in alright yep

00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:30,980
cool all right so right now I have no

00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:36,380
activities in my in my stream all right

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,670
so start on the love story here and this

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,370
is going to be a kind of a traditional

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,460
you know social networking interaction

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:50,780
model for for first streams so what

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:53,060
you'll see is mario here you know morrow

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,010
here gave a product to Jane Doe so you

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,050
know talk a little bit more motor

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,610
activity service is a format but you

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,160
know gay so get some flowers to his

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,170
friend Jane said let's go out right so

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,760
she's she hadn't it been Mario said

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,730
awesome we're going to go to go out this

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,110
is great and you can kind of see how

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,570
this whole place this all plays out in

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,070
this this canonical users stream view so

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,510
he's keeping us keeping track of what's

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,280
going on here yeah so you know for what

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,710
however I don't know he did but you Mari

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,700
satisfied a Jane which canonical said

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,330
that that's just you know not

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,550
appropriate we can't do that here

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,190
phrasing I think is what he said right

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:34,190
so amen Jane Doe cut off all day

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,480
sometimes with John Doe right activity

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,960
to draw something that apparently ruined

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,640
to her marriage with John Doe so but you

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,650
can kind of get the feel for how that

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,160
granted that was in an accelerated time

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:49,390
but you watch that I think I hit too

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,040
many enter keys but you watch that that

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,330
that kind of whole play out you know if

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,440
you took that over the course of a week

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,840
right you watched that whole scenario

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,420
play out inside of your activity stream

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,330
and you know Facebook or any social

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,790
network that you have alright so I'm

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:11,090
going to flip back a bit not hit the IDE

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:13,010
which i just opened but so that's that's

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,020
a very common pattern for an activity

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,850
metaphor all right what you see an

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,860
active activity streams today so what we

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,860
want to do is inside the businesses take

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,120
advantage of that same paradigm and the

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,700
format that we were pushing that in a

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,520
crowd is is activity streams in terms of

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,040
the specification so activity streams is

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,540
a new little speck that defines a

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,640
semantic way to describe activity data

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:42,660
let me see if I can actually pull it up

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,660
correctly here without opening the ID

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,720
all right so in this case it's adjacent

00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:07,510
representation of it but can you see it

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,920
all yeah so activity streams as a

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,910
specification just defines how you

00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,590
format data for an activity you have an

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:18,280
actor right that actors the thing that

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:20,680
is is doing the activity right so there

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,770
when it was John Doe he was Mario Rossi

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,470
Mario Rossi sent the flowers to Jane Doe

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,140
so he was the actor she was the object

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,030
in that in that particular or the

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,220
flowers were the object and then she was

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,100
the target so you have an actor you have

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,390
a object you know target and then you

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,340
know kind of a short description is the

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,440
content and then over right so that you

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,860
post is the default one there's other

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,540
verbs obviously like satisfy and another

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,600
hundred or so that you could there

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,520
possibly usable and actually the gadget

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,890
that you just saw that process that

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,170
activity stream doesn't actually have

00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,310
any you know beforehand data about any

00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,720
of these activities right it doesn't

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,160
know how to represent them and they're

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,300
literally represented in the format just

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,500
this way so then it's able to sit there

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,120
and parse it and say ok I've got an

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,550
actor they took some mob you know some

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,990
action via the verb against some some

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,920
object and then I can put the target so

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,810
you can really kind of put together

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:17,050
systems that that have a semantic

00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:21,910
understanding of this data so that's the

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:23,890
the format it's a it's pretty useful

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,460
right so OpenSocial used to have its own

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,890
activity data format and when activity

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,330
streams the specification was written

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,800
everybody in the community said why are

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,520
we doing this let's just use that

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,870
because it's been so from a business

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,490
perspective you know we want to be able

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,420
to take advantage of the street right so

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,280
if we're going to if we're going to

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,780
produce all of this and really kind of

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,090
embrace the fact that that stream

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,289
metaphor is useful for a human

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,980
terms of providing situational awareness

00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:52,600
we want to now be able to to take

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,159
advantage of the fact that we have users

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,409
looking at the stream to drive

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,809
functionality into their current context

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,220
so information aggregation is never good

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,039
enough right so portals are kind of

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,830
going away now in case anybody's has not

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,529
noticed portals are dinosaurs you know

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,880
big portlets or big you know gadgets

00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:11,980
that do nothing but pull together RSS

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,140
feeds and show information are fairly

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,850
useless loose is useless to your average

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,070
user because they may look at it once a

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,120
day all right your average enterprise

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,220
users not going to sit there all day

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,770
long and keep up to date via their

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,630
portal what you want to be able to do

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,429
though is allow them to work through

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,899
that environment and prevent the rural

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,580
tools and functionality so you can do

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:32,649
that by writing gadgets that are useful

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,419
that's good way but you can also take

00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:38,230
advantage of the stream to inject

00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:39,669
functionality into it so you need to be

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,649
able to deliver that functionality to

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,320
the user inside of that I created view

00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:46,240
and some form or fashion and then you

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,649
need to allow people who are creating

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,330
activities especially to distributed

00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:51,610
enterprise to be able to put their own

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,799
functionality in so that you as the

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,840
enterprise egg you know I tea shop tour

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,820
integrator don't have to write all the

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,649
functionality yourselves right so you

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,750
want to rely on them to since they know

00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:03,220
what their data are is they know that it

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,289
is and it with the service of a the

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,149
services they have are you can allow

00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:10,659
them to actually write their own gadgets

00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:12,460
and put it in so this is where

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,990
OpenSocial embedded experiences come in

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,580
OpenSocial embedded experiences are an

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,260
extension to the Activity Stream respect

00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,110
that are part of the OpenSocial

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:24,070
specification that define a separate

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,360
context for for delivering gadgets so

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,370
all you do is you reference the gadget

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,460
URL that you want to render and you also

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,320
give it the initialize or the context

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,080
that you want to have that gadget have

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,880
it start up and then the container is

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,529
responsible for launching it it's pretty

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,909
easy to do right so this is a very

00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:44,529
simple i'll show you exactly in the spec

00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:46,990
how we're doing it we order then this

00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:49,870
demo how we're doing it with a JSON but

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:51,940
it's also usable and email right so the

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,770
IBM guys went out and the Lotus guys

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,570
wouldn't register to mime type for

00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,240
didn't they end up doing a register your

00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,670
mime type yeah so that because their new

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,250
social business

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,410
four notes takes advantage of of

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,060
activity streams and OpenSocial to

00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,430
render gadgets inside their email client

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,840
took a now you can send them an email or

00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,000
you can send or can show up in their

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:18,900
connections feed either way you're able

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,580
to take advantage of the gadget so what

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,260
this looks like from from a data

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,910
perspective is so you see at least the

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,770
everything up here below or above

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,510
OpenSocial is all standard activity

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:30,810
streams and then there's just a speck

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,540
that extension here before OpenSocial so

00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,920
you have an embed property you tell you

00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,450
which gadget you wanted to do you tell

00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,250
it how you get some kidding to contain

00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,290
your hints on how you want that embedded

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,450
experience to be displayed so if you

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,550
want it to be a link text and this has

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,710
ADD comment otherwise the container is

00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,540
going to render whatever the default is

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,700
for that particular container and you

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,050
want to give it some context so in this

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,630
case like this for the first gadget

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,330
that's a it's in the context is a URL

00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,850
comments author it's an arbitrary

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,220
context and it's up to the person

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,900
producing the stream there are this the

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,640
actual activity entry to provide the

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:13,620
context to the container so what this

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:17,070
looks like and rave then is now where it

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,690
has has these other little links in the

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,740
activities so we're before just

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,630
destroyed activities you didn't see

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,940
anything now really says hey you know I

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,070
want you to I want to let you know as a

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,060
user you have the ability to do more

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,400
with this particular piece of

00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,230
information than you did before so in

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,240
the case of this you know canonical user

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:37,290
posted a photo at his photo album of

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,690
Boston for asking from the Charles River

00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:43,940
you can add a comment so what this looks

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,050
like get my laptop's a little slow today

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,940
waiting for local host that's never a

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,160
good thing so what this means is this is

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,090
a whole separate gadget that was just

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,300
launched write a whole separate

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,190
application where I can actually start

00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,020
to add a comment or see other people's

00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,460
comments for this particular picture so

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,730
now if you look at this rate of itself

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,920
knew nothing about the guy other than it

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,330
existed and it was published and allowed

00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,890
to be rendered that's the only two

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,780
things that have cared about all the

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,860
functionality for this was the stream

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,960
producer gave it the context

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,880
and put the activity stream entry in and

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,250
then broke the gadget for taking

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,900
advantage of it so now you know where is

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,400
it you you could do this with your own

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,570
application and eat order does this to

00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,830
some degree with with some of the

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,510
content they come through but it's all

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,549
custom handling right oh this is an

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,309
image this is a video you know this is

00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,900
something else I'm going to do this here

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:34,809
the contain yourself for the you know in

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,850
grave the main you I had nothing to do

00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:38,710
with the functionality of the gadget

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,840
itself that's really powerful because

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,610
that's a cool new metaphor forward

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:49,720
interacting with your users so if I say

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:51,160
here this is a horrible picture all

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,280
right come up with some you know

00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,410
comments submitted I close it out your

00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,570
user just interacted with some piece of

00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,299
content and never had to leave their

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,010
context so i can do that again with the

00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,530
you know video right so i'm going to

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,059
slide out a video here i'm going to

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,950
watch the video i can add a comment on

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,470
it again this is a whole YouTube gadget

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,820
that you know wasn't written by the

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,950
Apache great project wasn't written by

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,270
anybody other than I think was that BM

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,350
guys actually the head of burning it I

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:21,700
can play my video and add my comments

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,380
and then go back to what i was doing

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,380
without ever leaving that context

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,950
exploit its over here so what does that

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,630
mean from a business perspective right

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,350
so watching videos and commenting on

00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,250
pictures just not very compelling

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,260
hopefully shows you a little bit of an

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,669
example of how you could start to build

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,559
applications that could take advantage

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:45,730
of this especially I know if any of you

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,610
Cod you know Craig's presentation

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,590
earlier on Apache streams but what what

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,540
might is trying to do is is have a whole

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,070
bunch of public publishers of activity

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,299
streams inside the enterprise share

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,650
points you know L all these other tools

00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,030
that we use we want to be able to push

00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,040
activities and from any one of those

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:07,750
endpoints have aggregated and delivered

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:09,610
to our users on the portal a great

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,830
example of a business case here is you

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,290
know so Jimbo submitted a page and the

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,510
answer common her time or her time sheet

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:18,520
for approval any of you who are managers

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,130
that have to manage timesheets you know

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,050
this is a common case your employees

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,110
charge time you have to approve it

00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,299
before you can move on

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,620
now normally the way this works is you

00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,120
get some email notification you have to

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,470
go over to another application or you

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,940
have to remember on a Monday that you

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,620
have to do that but if it just pops up

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,940
in your stream and I can sit here and

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,640
say oh I'm going to view my view the

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:42,679
timesheet and hopefully they get your

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:45,500
loads right and so right so I can see

00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,290
okay so yeah we use clarity in case

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,790
anybody didn't know this right yeah I

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,100
miss it here and say okay so Jane Doe

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,179
she charged eight hours later okay she's

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,419
all sad i'm going to go ahead and prove

00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:59,570
it right very simple right again

00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:03,350
immediate interaction with the content

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,549
source back to her job so if you know if

00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,320
you're not just sitting on a proto but

00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,429
you have say you know we're putting

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,380
together nice is a project leader

00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:11,450
dashboard where our project leaders have

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,090
all the information they have to manage

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,850
about their projects there the the time

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:19,700
tracking the project information that

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,980
they deliver you know for the metadata

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,450
about the project and all the tracking

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,590
information and all their cute what we

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:29,450
call the quality workflow and also any

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,620
artifacts that that project produces or

00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,630
if you can give them a dashboard that

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,070
based on widgets that is able to

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,290
interact with all of that stuff and also

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,270
a stream of information when things

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,559
happen so there somebody charges

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,630
something on a project or somebody needs

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:43,700
travel approval or somebody is you know

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,750
made a comment on a particular document

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,309
that they're getting ready to produce if

00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,380
you can do all that and deliver that

00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:50,510
that V in the stream now you can

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,770
actually start to let them interact from

00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,020
one interface and not have to jump

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,150
around with 50 different tools so that's

00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:03,370
that's kind of the power of of the

00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:03,370
embedded experience so

00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,320
that's pretty much it so we'll move on

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,480
to questions but a couple resources

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:21,180
first if I can click without opening

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:22,890
random applications so OpenSocial right

00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,960
so open socials got a brand new website

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:27,660
they're always looking for more people

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,760
to get engaged activity streams check

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:36,560
out the specification Apache rave get it

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:38,880
on our mail lists but any questions I

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:54,990
talking like the for people who don't

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:56,400
already know stuff yep yep so activities

00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,740
rooms I think you you heard earlier your

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,620
activity streams are embraced pretty

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:05,400
heavily by atlassian so across a lot of

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,710
their products this type of model allows

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,930
you to deliver atlassian activities and

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,580
gadgets through a different interface

00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,560
right so if you had a project leader

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,970
dashboard you can tap it right there I

00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,350
don't know of any others that are

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,330
directly using the activity streams

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,240
format but there are a ton that have AP

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:24,540
is and where there's an API there's an

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,130
ability to really set up this

00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,540
integration in a lightweight manner all

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,130
you need something that's able to look

00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,660
at what's changing inside of it either

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,670
get event notifications of when stuff

00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,940
changes or poll for events and then push

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:41,500
it into your your activity stream from

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:44,520
there go ahead yep

00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,520
I think that

00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:54,210
more question though is because of the

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,180
fact that the information is all coming

00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,810
on shooting when you think about it from

00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,570
when

00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:05,580
users expected or you essentially are

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,710
there other clients instances when you

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,340
show us all of these demos easy right is

00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,340
there anything that

00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,480
but so really absolutely not because

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,400
robe is very spec based right so it's an

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,970
open source project there are certain

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,920
containers like jive where they have

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,760
specific api's that are only available

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,200
to that container so the general

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,420
recommendation is use defensive

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,130
programming write tests to see if a

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,900
giant library exists before you go for

00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,940
it and find something useful with in

00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,200
case it doesn't but there's a big push

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,510
to try to get people to use the default

00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,950
stuff because like you said right so the

00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,780
another thing one thing to keep in mind

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,820
too is the embedded experience gadget

00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,880
that you know you saw all those gadgets

00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,250
those don't have to be only used for

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,810
amended experiences right you couldn't

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,060
deliver them as regular functionality so

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,560
say the time card approval right I have

00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,140
to I don't have to write a time card

00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,100
approval ee gadget or e is short for a

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,280
better experience to hear you're not

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,870
java ee i don't have to write a time

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,360
card approval ee gadget and also have

00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,919
you know time card approval gadget on my

00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,270
page to write make them two different

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,919
things they can beat the same thing

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,350
that's that's what's awesome about this

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,510
is you know you just it's a context

00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,520
check do I have data do I have bootstrap

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,560
data or not if I do have bootstrap data

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,380
use that otherwise go with my API and

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,520
find out what approvals have to be done

00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,590
so that's where you can kind of get that

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,649
reuse capability across all the

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,640
different interfaces as you have and so

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:38,800
like my day we're going to have like

00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,030
three or four different brave instances

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,100
so the three or four different

00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,470
OpenSocial container is running and

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,850
there's also you know potentially places

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,250
where we have to shindig running and not

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,810
a fright but all of them use the same

00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,120
programming format all of them use this

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:55,899
model and all the news gadgets so

00:34:52,120 --> 00:35:00,190
they're able to do the same thing so

00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:01,540
that's pretty that's pretty neat so a

00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:05,620
good takeaway

00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:08,790
please for me that raised a good example

00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:13,540
of the standards-based container the

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:16,480
demonstrate the functionality but at

00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:31,150
least we're hoping so Peppa it shows

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:35,100
what all right so yeah it's not a very

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,100
good diagram but it is a diagram sure

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:51,119
yep so well yep right sure no problem so

00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,520
Rove the web application run it's just a

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,280
ward and it has you know persistence

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,260
layer some common services that do the

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,900
layout management and how you see the

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,790
widgets on the page it has an API that

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,010
work we're going to be shortly expanding

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,960
on right and then a UI layer that's

00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,020
that's there and then the OpenSocial

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,020
client is literally just a provider that

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,450
does nothing but map the pieces of or

00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:19,109
back to the pieces of shindig that are

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:20,700
necessary to render the gadgets so one

00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,470
of them is a security token right so

00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,300
generate security tokens for first in

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,770
dec another thing it does is get

00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,540
metadata and cash it on the rave side

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,280
for those gadgets so that it can

00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,109
pre-populate it in the common container

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,349
none of that is really important but

00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:35,580
it's it's very simple and lightweight

00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:37,200
shindig is another web application it

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,990
can live anywhere right so these two

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,310
brave and shindig don't have to be they

00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,480
just only have to be network accessible

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:46,310
to each other right they don't have to

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,589
live anywhere in a common location and

00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:52,560
then the wave has a shindig persistence

00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:54,359
layer that's maps to the the shindig SP

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,250
is right so that's that's kind of what

00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,619
that's trying to show and then there's a

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,990
whole shindig itself is really two

00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:04,170
different minds it does gadget rendering

00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:08,760
and OpenSocial API s right there are two

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:10,650
different things but they both exist in

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,250
the same limit location and then the

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,920
client runtime is theoretically you

00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,240
could build any client runtime or

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,760
hopefully soon build any client runtime

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,710
once we have some done summary work on

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,210
the api's on the right side but in this

00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,290
case that's the client runtime runs in

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,849
the browser so this is all JavaScript

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,740
the shindig common containers a

00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:31,710
javascript file that gets pulled out of

00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:34,230
shindig and then the Raven social

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,210
provider is again a delta me of the

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,339
delegated provider for mapping the

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:41,010
common container to all the rave you I

00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,839
pieces so I rave it has abstracted

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,430
although that open gadget open popup

00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,050
stuff that you saw that you can do

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,690
through the through the OpenSocial API

00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,280
is rave has a container level

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,780
abstraction of that so

00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,730
any JavaScript running in the page can

00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,610
kick up a new pop-up can kick up a new

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:59,610
slide out but when it does inside of

00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:02,870
that is up to the provider in this case

00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:05,310
the rail social provider excuse me I

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,990
know it's got some API wrappers and some

00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:11,340
core java script to manage the widgets

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:14,640
on the page that make sense anymore

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:18,110
questions own a bike I said it's not a

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,110
good diagram but it is a diagram

00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,240
who is it

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:35,189
so the way that authentication works is

00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:37,890
the web the road web app is out has a as

00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:40,619
authentic ated right so users login to

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,529
that web app and then if for the

00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:46,769
OpenSocial case what happens is there's

00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:48,059
a security token that gets all that

00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:49,739
really is this a symmetric encryption

00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,839
right so that there's a pre-shared key

00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:55,019
between the rave web app and the shindig

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,809
web app and the container will take a

00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:59,939
what they call a token which is just you

00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:02,669
know it's a data a property bag right it

00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:04,919
has the person who's viewing it the page

00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:08,130
the person who is owned the owner of the

00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:10,650
page some properties about the page and

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,299
then the container name and then it

00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,059
takes all of that and encrypts it and

00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:19,079
sends it across as a along with the

00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:20,819
gadget to shindig when it renders it and

00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,009
then shindig is able to say so then it

00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:25,019
for any authenticated API call like it

00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:27,599
to get person or to put activity streams

00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:29,999
in and that token will go with the call

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:35,929
and then it's able to figure out okay

00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:35,929
well this is the the owner is and you're

00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:54,210
to understand each gadget can see who

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,670
the owner and the viewer are of the page

00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,900
right so ordering them so they get that

00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,560
they can have that through the

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,560
OpenSocial API

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,040
say so

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:23,780
and you actually have access to people

00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:26,030
right so that's where Apache streams

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,220
fixes that right so what you need is an

00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,810
activity stream processor who's going to

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,590
give you the activities back that you

00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:35,180
can see in the case of this example we

00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:38,230
you know of the example code inside of

00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,370
shindig today or rave shindig and the

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,900
repository just goes out and queries

00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,600
anybody that you're connected to so

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,090
that's why in this example you can only

00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,220
see your activities or activities for

00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:52,130
people that you're connected to since

00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,980
since canonical is connected to Jane to

00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:57,950
John Doe Angie a Jane Doe he can see

00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,780
John Doe is really the only deciding

00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,370
factor in this case but he's connected

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,750
to John Doe so he can see the this

00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,640
activity entry he's connected to Mario

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:10,190
Rossi so he can see this entry he's

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:13,760
connected to John he's connected to John

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,050
Doe with this one as well right he sees

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,940
his own things and the Jane Doe he's

00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,370
connected to sue so he can see that one

00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,040
but in a real environment what you'd

00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,690
want to have is so you know like a real

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,400
enterprise environment so I'm if I have

00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,110
people underneath me right so I'm an HR

00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,600
manager I want to be able to see

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,300
activities that people in the report to

00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,740
me are able to produce right and he's

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,840
something like in time card approval

00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,130
that's only targeted at me all right

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,590
nobody else should be able to see that

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,630
so so the stream processor has to be

00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,820
intelligent as to the environment it's

00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,820
in in order to deliver the right content

00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,610
so that's a very hard problem and pretty

00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,560
much what we did is say we'll move that

00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,020
problem over here to the string process

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,160
I hit because that's going to be Emma

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,380
especially when you starting to talk

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,590
about high volume right so being able to

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:05,870
do real time you know essentially the

00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,490
lot is going to be how we index you know

00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,290
that's going to depend on / environment

00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,310
so we're going to have flexible index

00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,310
models and

00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:25,340
Yeah right yeah I think it's critical

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,920
that we're going to have to have some

00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,470
persistence that right now rave process

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,060
it to the database so there's a there's

00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:35,000
a finite number of activities that you

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,500
can have before it goes kaboom if you

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,010
use the MongoDB layer it's a different

00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,010
finite number but it's still funny so

00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,580
yeah so this is all apartment so the

00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,050
first time I was just kind of showing

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,340
rave and what it does right the second

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,350
demo was very much about the embedded

00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,850
experience right as long as we're

00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,380
talking about the same thing right so so

00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,300
this is actually the social page is

00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,430
actually just a different page inside of

00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,490
this person's context so I'm logged in

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,410
as canonical user here so I come in here

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,880
all of this functionality is still

00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,130
available to them and we use a lot of

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,750
this but the focus of this talk was to

00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:22,790
show the activity streams integration

00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:24,170
piece so when they cook the link the

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,000
witch that in this case it's

00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,170
specifically an OpenSocial gadget right

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,120
now we don't have the ability to launch

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,920
a w3c embedded experience but there's

00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,660
not really anything that would prevent

00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,630
that other than just making sure we have

00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,920
some common adapters but yeah so when

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,380
they click the link what's happening is

00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,140
the embedded experiences opening that

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,390
gadget so in this case so you see here

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,480
this is probably how I'd come to you

00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:50,300
know Canonical's profile and I can see

00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,430
Canonical's activities alright so if I'm

00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,380
going to go to to aarons profile inside

00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,260
of my dear I'll see something like this

00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,060
the things that erin has done and then

00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,190
these bedded experiences may or may not

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,690
show up depending on you so that's

00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,220
another security term that will have to

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,220
do that's very container specific but

00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:20,099
um so I would think that the anything of

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:24,150
producing the content would probably be

00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:26,460
making widgets they usually oh yeah last

00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,349
thing we could or it service so I could

00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,910
do it for for them right i could write a

00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:33,329
gadget it hits their api if they don't

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:35,760
have one but ideally the people who who

00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:39,390
have the data are also producing the

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,609
gadgets as well yeah they do have

00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,869
gadgets so so juror has all those things

00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:44,300
when you actually go use activities and

00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:46,140
stuff like that they're all gadgets but

00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,720
unless things have drastically changed

00:44:46,140 --> 00:45:04,619
that last scene was stuck on an older

00:44:48,720 --> 00:45:07,319
version shindig for what so I think that

00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,579
from the Apaches room side I'd expect

00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:11,280
that the people should be able to write

00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,750
modules to inject you know I embedded

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,040
experiences and strip them out as

00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,460
necessary to right so there should be

00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,230
because it might very well I'd love to

00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,300
have everybody that owns all these

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:25,950
different systems build the gadgets they

00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:28,220
just probably aren't so right right

00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,220
right

00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:49,430
sure yet actually so I'll show a really

00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:55,460
simple one and then I'll show a harder

00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:59,150
one if we have time so this is the

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,800
manifest it's pretty it can be as simple

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,570
or as complicated as you want it to be

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,180
we're trying to push people to the more

00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,220
simple or simpler you know gadgets back

00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,170
when they build them so you can see here

00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,310
you have a module the module preps kind

00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,490
of have all the metadata about the

00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,620
module or the gadget right so you can

00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,840
have some sub default with tight things

00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,920
like that description and author email

00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,750
all those types of things would be part

00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,910
of that that would be attributes on this

00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,590
node then I'm going to require some

00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,140
features alright so I'm going to require

00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:28,910
the OSAP I OpenSocial API I'm going to

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,170
require dynamic height would let which

00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:35,030
let me lets me call a utility function

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:39,110
to automatically resize the gadget I

00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:40,550
frame based on the content and then bet

00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,430
experience is right because I want to be

00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,360
able to load the context open views

00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,080
because it wouldn't be able to kick off

00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:50,060
in anything then you define content

00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,140
areas so though some other attributes

00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,970
can go in here too so you can define

00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,760
your OAuth services you can do i define

00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:57,080
pre-loaded images and contents and all

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,150
that kinda stuff like that there's you

00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,620
can define API calls that get called

00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,090
when the gadgets rendered and stuffed

00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,230
into the data context before it gets to

00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,910
the client side so it doesn't have to

00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:08,270
make an ajax called also all sorts of

00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:10,070
other next steps beyond just this but

00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:12,380
then the content piece is the the

00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,030
critical you know except for the views

00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,800
right so social has different the

00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,300
concept of different types of views so

00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,400
you can have an embedded view default

00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,830
view home view profile view these types

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,340
of things like that and you can have

00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:29,300
multiple content sections each one that

00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:30,470
you know matches a set of views and then

00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,540
in this case what it's doing is

00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:35,960
referencing the time you know at just a

00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:38,500
simple HTML file that's like really

00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,500
simple

00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:46,079
right so in this case this HTML file has

00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:48,329
a you know causal you till the onload

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,549
handler to press the function to get

00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:53,309
started this is the this is really how

00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:57,210
you're getting at the the e e data right

00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:59,579
so it's got a listener for data and then

00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:01,289
that gets called to get action that data

00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,359
out which is what the book gets passed

00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:04,859
in the initialization of the gadget so

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,869
this is where if you have the same

00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:09,569
gadget that's doing timecard approvals

00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:11,160
you probably have you know something

00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:12,690
that the checks to see if there's actual

00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,829
context or not and then goes off and

00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:18,989
makes an API call if it doesn't as you

00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:22,499
so as you can see were hard coding in

00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:39,660
the this was a demo gadget so we're hard

00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:40,950
coding in the data so ya know this is

00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,299
you know like the pay no attention to

00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,299
mend the man behind the curtain stuff

00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:58,650
yep right so you see he's got jquery

00:48:52,200 --> 00:49:00,420
here he's using handlebars yep it loads

00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,779
into lifer so each one of these is my

00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,779
friend

00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:12,369
the gadget is I brain with standard HTML

00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:12,369
CSS JavaScript whatever you normally do

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:19,190
yeah join us and then the additional

00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:23,000
benefit because these are OpenSocial

00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:26,420
gadget you get some extra JavaScript

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,030
libraries provided to you to do gadgety

00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,339
things way to interact container or with

00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:33,020
other gadgets right again you guys are

00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:36,200
so JavaScript library that lets you

00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,970
clubs up and the way you request those

00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,700
feature sets is through the module

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,130
perhaps it was when you talk about

00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,720
dynamically injected beach dress

00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,950
basically you declare the pieces of code

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:55,369
which you access to and those are

00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:58,099
provided so a more complicated example

00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:59,480
of this is the the activities your

00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:03,680
gadget so you can still see here that

00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:06,380
it's pretty simple from the the spec

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,180
perspective I have a couple of user

00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,680
preferences here to that get tracked by

00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,420
the container right so in this case you

00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,880
know how often you refresh to go find

00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:18,260
your activities and what the max number

00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,930
of items that will display are and then

00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,390
you get into you know in this case the

00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:28,430
this at HTML file gotta remember to

00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:31,940
confuse source it's really just a stroll

00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:33,770
HTML file with the handlebars templates

00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:38,270
that I'm going to use to render out the

00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:39,770
activity data so this is the activity

00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:43,490
stream gadget this is one that renders

00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,720
the activity streams so this is a these

00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,790
are just handlebar templates for the

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:51,290
different Kate cases in which activities

00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:53,450
can be presented if I come back here and

00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:58,150
then there's lots of JavaScript right so

00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:58,150
this is much more processing intense

00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:08,580
mmm right so here's a lot more code

00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:11,349
involved in making it a display pretty

00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:13,240
but this renders out the activities then

00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:14,560
to give you an idea of how you can

00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,720
action so any gadget can actually create

00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,460
an embedded experience to write so that

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,210
doesn't have to be part of a stream just

00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,210
makes it the heck a lot easier

00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:35,270
yeah I can you set up like a web socket

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,010
and connected over on Craig have you

00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:41,240
ever set up a connected web socket

00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:43,010
through the shindig proxy so it's a so I

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,150
don't know if do you guys replace your

00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,960
proxy or do you just run the straight

00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:51,290
shindig one yeah so so most of us do our

00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,210
replace the proxy right so with and like

00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,329
IBM delegates out to their IBM proxy

00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:59,410
they have like the uber IBM proxy but it

00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,820
is just an HTTP proxy so if if it's

00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:06,380
allowable through a proxy should be

00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:07,460
allowable for the gadget I've you know

00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,160
one of the things i want to do with

00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,130
OpenSocial is allow for convenience

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,270
wrappers on that kind of stuff where so

00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,940
we have a home you saw the whole data

00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,290
context right so to give you I'll finish

00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,970
this and go back to the file but so the

00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,380
gadgets views you know open a better

00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,990
experience right so this opens Oh

00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,839
embedded experience with the context

00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:29,630
from the activity stream entry very

00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:34,060
simple easy to handle and then you saw

00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:34,060
how it the utter file got the

00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:53,720
look at that Aaron's awesome code again

00:52:49,579 --> 00:53:19,190
I mean so to be fair Aaron Aaron did do

00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:20,810
this in like half an hour so yep yep so

00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,150
you hit the rave URL right so that's a

00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:25,310
web application that bootstraps the all

00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:29,150
of the chrome which we call chrome right

00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:32,150
so all this stuff is all chrome if I can

00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:33,440
get to the actual page but right so

00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:35,060
there's the rave you I pieces right so

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,609
all these pieces with the context menu

00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:39,710
and all that fun stuff that that is what

00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:41,570
rave does and then on the client side

00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,820
that goes off to the Nick common

00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,920
container and it you know loads out the

00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:49,190
gadgets which essentially means hit the

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,839
iframe point URL inside of shindig where

00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:56,390
it renders it out and then you display

00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:58,670
the iframe so yeah but go back to the

00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:00,079
context without what I'd like to do so

00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,390
you see here we have this whole

00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,250
OpenSocial data context thing and you

00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:08,300
can you can read register of listeners

00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:10,460
out of different types but to really be

00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,690
able to drive very easily from a

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,550
programming model like the whole

00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:15,079
real-time interaction or so I just

00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,480
handle you know listeners on a data

00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,599
context i define what does i say in my

00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,329
gadget spec which service i want to pull

00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,280
for to you know hit for that data

00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:26,869
context and then i can just you know

00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,630
open up a channel straight down or i can

00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:30,950
define a real time you know component on

00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,369
my server side that says hey this is

00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:36,890
this is going to listen to you know an

00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:38,660
active mq you know an active mq listener

00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,980
when it gets a new message in that its

00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,480
most responding to send it out to the

00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,810
client right through that data context

00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,250
listener with an open socket so and then

00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,630
did all the programmer on the client

00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,980
side has to do is just register for

00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,680
events in the data context and it's all

00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:54,670
handled by declare very declaratively so

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,670
i think that's bad be fun to do

00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:08,220
so too heavy right now to embed but that

00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:10,680
should be something that we are taking

00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:14,160
on very shortly to get rid of so when

00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,290
our wave has quite a few J his piece to

00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,090
do stuff hopefully within the next

00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:21,290
couple months there will be no need for

00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:29,580
jsps and it'll be pure rest services and

00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:31,230
client-side templates potentially I mean

00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,490
you could figure that out right yet so

00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,900
that's that's Chris in the back who

00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:39,990
wants to just throw in his osgi

00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:44,070
container and make it all work right so

00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:45,990
repositories are just interfaces that go

00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,100
get data right so it's like go fetch

00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,300
mean if you want to make it a hit a

00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:52,320
database that's great so right now we

00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,940
have two full supported repository

00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,740
layers currently that are independent

00:55:53,940 --> 00:56:01,620
from each other but there's a MongoDB

00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:03,540
layer and a JP a sequel layer we store

00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,940
that yeah really just the relationships

00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,100
of the widgets how they look on this

00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,130
page right so so in this case the the

00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,510
page has you know it so sing it tells it

00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,610
what type of layout it is it says

00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,170
there's one there's one instance of the

00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,150
activity streams gadget on the page

00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,480
right and here's all the preferences

00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:24,660
about that that are that are set so it's

00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,670
probably like light data is really but

00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,910
yeah so we're going to be refactoring

00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:37,890
pretty heavily to to support a much more

00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:40,430
embeddable model just HTML then v FF so

00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:45,239
the wages are sort of all that

00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:53,430
regret exactly so you have you somewhere

00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:56,099
anywhere in all ways or is that right

00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:57,749
and it's a light metadata about it all

00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:01,799
right so for us this miss this is a

00:56:57,749 --> 00:57:03,930
really huge for our ite ops so that we

00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:05,640
can reduce the complexity of deployments

00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:07,859
is what we have now is you know with

00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,170
this whole model it opens up okay we've

00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:12,029
got rave that is pretty generic it

00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,529
doesn't really care about you know

00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:15,660
there's a lot to change there so that

00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:17,729
doesn't that changes very rarely and

00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:19,619
then there's the the rest services that

00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:23,130
feed all of our corporate data whether

00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:27,259
it be you no clarity time you know time

00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:29,700
reporting or whatever and then we have

00:57:27,259 --> 00:57:31,349
gadgets and we can deploy any of those

00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,299
pieces independently of each other as

00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:35,309
long as we don't break the contracts

00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:37,259
between them then we don't have to worry

00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:38,700
about massive deployments and stuff like

00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:40,819
that it's really very very flexible very

00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,229
nice I mean we're world a production

00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:46,249
we've actually got into production with

00:57:43,229 --> 00:57:46,249
gadgets couple times a day

00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:06,270
hi management desktop security

00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:06,270
though and right now

00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,350
if you want to do that need to do at

00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,180
appointments over the weekend or at

00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:16,660
night or something and we get a place

00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:18,490
where the service providers gosh you're

00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:24,300
basically static religious

00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:28,180
and then or the

00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:31,480
HTML Javascript CSS so if they make a

00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,730
change people to make a change apply any

00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,340
time to deploy to their own apartment

00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,230
they deploy it and so users can get it

00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:42,490
Justin feedback you don't have to plan

00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:45,480
out and I could have really big value

00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,480
except

00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,940
right because if anybody's ever done a

00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:56,640
coordinated deployment before like over

00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:59,609
a weekend those are things to avoid with

00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,680
at all costs sharepoint SharePoint has a

00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:02,729
tendency to do that right massive

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,069
quintuplet on what we're going to

00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:08,700
upgrade sharepoint being everybody take

00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:10,499
the weekend to get ready stuff all right

00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:18,019
any other questions are we all ready for

00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:18,019
