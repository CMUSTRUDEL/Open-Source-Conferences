okay good morning everybody and welcome

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:13,200
to Apache con North America 2013 very

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,910
happy to have you all here for those of

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,190
you who don't know me I'm Steve Holden

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,510
and my company the open bastion was

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,140
selected by the apache software

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,289
foundation to run apache con North

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,960
America this year and I'm very happy to

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,990
say that we've we betted to report that

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,059
we brought you to Portland a place where

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,219
I myself have lived for the past two

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,050
years well i say i have lived in

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,780
portland for the past two years but in

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,640
actual fact until fairly recently my

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,250
life was typically three weeks at home

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,559
five weeks away three weeks at home two

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,559
weeks away a week at home for weeks away

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,840
so although i have actually formerly

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,180
resided in portland for two years i only

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,239
actually spent about a year of it in

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,160
portland so having arrived back from a

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,710
fairly lengthy trip over the Christmas

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,530
period I am now in the middle of a

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,560
luxurious eight weeks uninterruptedly in

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,659
Portland and it's reminded me what a

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,280
fabulous place Portland is to live it's

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,619
also by the way a very good place to

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,630
work in open source and you're probably

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,990
aware if you've read your program

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,650
introduction that Portland builds itself

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,299
as the open source capital of the USA

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,850
I'm not sure whether anybody else agrees

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,210
with that billing but certainly nobody

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,909
disagrees and Portland is making a name

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,369
for itself as a great place to be for

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,150
open source so not only this year do we

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,860
have a patchy Con this year but also the

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,259
OpenStack people are having the

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,790
conference here our scones coming here

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,670
again there are more and more open

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,509
source conferences coming to Portland so

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,540
thank you for coming and we really do

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,770
hope that you have a wonderful time as

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,579
you might deduce from my jacket here I'm

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,500
I'm an escapee from the Python world

00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:07,500
most of my recent open source

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,520
contributions have been to the Python

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,120
world and so for me the Apache world is

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,010
is a slightly strange world

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,989
thanks to the foundation the open

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,720
bastion had the opportunity to help with

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,760
the organization of hepatic on Europe

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,530
towards the end of last year in since

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:32,190
I'm in Germany and I had the good

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,069
fortune to meet a very large number of

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,840
people from the Apache community during

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,879
that week that we had in Germany it was

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,340
a wonderful time never had a conference

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,459
in a football stadium before and while

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,690
it might not seem like an ideal venue

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,870
people did seem to like it had an

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,079
excellent time and so as far as I'm

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,620
concerned it's good to be back with the

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,569
Apache community again and to see at

00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,819
least some faces who've been able to

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,099
make the trip either made the trip from

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,129
from America to Europe last November and

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:09,180
are now here or have come over from

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:12,269
Europe so thanks for coming but I'm

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,480
aware that Python isn't perhaps as much

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:18,090
used in the Apache world as Java is for

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,980
example I know Java is one of your big

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,480
languages and I have to confess that I I

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:31,079
did once write a blog whose title was

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:34,319
Java is object-oriented COBOL and a lot

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,470
of people didn't seem to notice that the

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,849
publication date was the first of April

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,269
so I did actually have some rather

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:47,220
interesting dialogues around that around

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:49,500
that post and so there you know the the

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,220
python vs Java thing that this verse is

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,750
that so often in the world of open

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,780
source particularly in the world of

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,290
competitive and proprietary products but

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,250
even in the world of open source we do

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,049
get our our this versus that

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,650
controversies and the apache software

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:13,650
foundation somewhat unusual really in

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:19,380
that it's it's actually a unifying body

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:21,209
of sorts I was struck when I had to make

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,599
my assessment of the apache software

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,240
foundation as a potential customer I was

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,960
struck by the fact that I cannot think

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,819
of a

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:36,000
single software vendor that has anywhere

00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,039
near the product range that you would

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,990
get from from the apache software

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:44,430
foundation nobody else it seems to me is

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,310
managing such a diverse group of

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,949
projects and one of the interesting

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,479
things that I've noticed about the

00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,810
Apache community when it gets together

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,940
is that a lot of the talk focuses on how

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,349
these technologies can be better

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,419
integrated and so I think that the

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:05,789
apache software foundation is the the

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:08,400
oldest established software foundation

00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:10,560
is actually teaching people some very

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,130
valuable lessons and you may notice that

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,610
there's actually a kind of a theme

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,460
through the keynotes this week we're

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,770
really trying to emphasize the the idea

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,880
of community and to get the apache

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,139
software community itself to focus on

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,860
itself and I know a number of people

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,690
have suggested that it might have been a

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,340
different conference had we not for

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,190
example been scheduled against another

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,440
conference whose topics are big data in

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,970
the cloud but I think that's going to

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,530
make this a very interesting conference

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,960
basically it means that the people who

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,300
are here this week are the people who

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,360
will come to Apache con no matter what

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,120
else is competing with it so I see you

00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:00,780
as a very significant and a very

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:04,050
important bunch of people so it takes a

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,349
lot of effort from various people to put

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,750
a conference together and I'd

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,969
particularly like you to put your hands

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,370
together and thank our sponsors and our

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:16,110
exhibitors without whom the conference

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,610
wouldn't be possible so Citrix and all

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,900
the others thank you very much for

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,900
supporting Apache

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:32,390
so in the program it wasn't easy to put

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,430
the program together and I did have a

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,230
lot of help and so for everyone who

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,760
worked hard on the reviewers team thank

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,930
you very much for helping us to put this

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,090
program together you may notice that

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,120
there are what seemed to be holes in the

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,400
program bits of contact content that we

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,430
should perhaps have included that we we

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,070
didn't and we're certainly prepared to

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,750
accept input on that anything that you

00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,450
think we could or might do to improve

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,640
the conference please let us know any

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,250
ideas to the registration desk they will

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,800
not be filed to death knell we'll listen

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,100
to them and hopefully try and and action

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,990
them as well one thing I did notice that

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,030
we don't have in the conference when we

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,680
don't seem to have in the program is

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,660
testing and that's that's a subject near

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,170
and dear to my heart because I think the

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,780
second or third job I had as a

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,520
commercial programmer involved working

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,620
for I was working at the time for a

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,380
company that was in the fascinating

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,270
business of renting out scaffolding so

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,260
you can imagine they had 52 branches up

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:38,530
and down the UK and so it felt to me to

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,420
write the program that wrote the report

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,980
which was the report of all the movement

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,990
so this is back in the old days of

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,430
course of line printers and screened

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:51,980
listings so we were producing a 300 page

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,720
listing about all the interbranch

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,910
movements of the various pieces of

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,220
scaffolding and so on and so forth it

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,710
was a fairly primitive but nevertheless

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,890
effective control system and so the

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,710
systems analyst and I decided that it

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:10,280
would be a nice little piece of

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,680
humanization if you like in to put a

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,930
little addition into the program after

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,220
after testing was over of course so that

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,410
it wasn't actually formally tested so

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,510
that an extra line came out in the

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,180
headings in week 50 that red and a merry

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,910
Christmas to all our readers from steve

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,270
holden and andy partridge and he was the

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,370
the systems analyst so this was all very

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,620
well and good and

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,680
job mobility being what it was at the

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,919
time I actually left a mill scaffolding

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,800
before Christmas and thought no more

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,080
about this until about a year later when

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,570
I met one of my former colleagues in a

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,430
data center and talked felted wattle

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,140
what had been going on at Mills scaffold

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,960
and he said oh don't ever go back there

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,520
I said why not he said well the chief

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,830
programmer old skin you you know that

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,410
300-page report that you wrote I said

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,620
yeah the stock movement report he said

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,020
well the week before Christmas it wasn't

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,089
a 300-page report it was a 600 page

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,130
report on every other line in the report

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,760
read and a merry Christmas to all our

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:20,020
readers from steve holden and andy party

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,150
so I'm very very aware of the need for

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,060
testing I'm sorry that we we missed that

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,520
out of the program but as I say if there

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,820
are any other holes will will do what I

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:35,279
can what we can to make sure that we

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,279
