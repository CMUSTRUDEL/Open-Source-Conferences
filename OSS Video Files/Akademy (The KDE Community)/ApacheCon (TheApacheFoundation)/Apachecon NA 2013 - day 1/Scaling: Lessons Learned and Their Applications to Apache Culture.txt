	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,750
it is my great pleasure to introduce our

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,500
basically our first keynote speaker

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,849
today Thea lives very very close to me

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,230
and it was really really funny because

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,330
yesterday came up and said here is we

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,910
had to fly all the way across country

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,619
just to meet each other okay you'll find

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,420
it kind of common in a lot of you know

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,460
asf projects people will know the names

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,109
not so much the faces and even when

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,869
you're talking to each other you don't

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,929
get the opportunity unfortunately to

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,929
Europe so you want to play

00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:56,859
developers not presenters like I present

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,229
more than alright so everyone I'd like

00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:02,439
to welcome a CEO / Nagle he will be

00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:05,350
talking to us for the next 45 minutes or

00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:08,500
so will you be trying to tread time for

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:10,509
a Q&A at the very very end okay so if

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,220
you're our questions try to hold them

00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:19,320
off do well okay we're going to go and

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,320
switch the microphone real quick

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:50,070
okay all set all righty see I have to

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,480
accept the wireless internet connection

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:58,190
agreement hold on there we go Patrick on

00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,560
na all right so hi welcome to patch com

00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:05,340
I've been involved with the asf since I

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,780
guess 2000 I've talked at a lot of

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,160
Apache cons on on topics usually we

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,040
revolving around scalable systems design

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,410
that's what I do I make things grow

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,060
really big a lot of that has to do with

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,390
the performance some of it has to do

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,740
with scalability amazingly almost all of

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,360
it has to do with Apache so a lot of you

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,920
may have seen me before but I look

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,540
different so we'll do a little intro

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:37,260
slide of the various various issues that

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,890
I have these pictures are all taken in a

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,650
single 12 month time span and I have you

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,440
know my different different type of you

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,000
know moods that go with that do not try

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,120
to fly on airplanes in the last one it

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,440
did not work well I remember Barcelona

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,120
not so fondly so a scalable systems

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,640
design since that's what I do that's

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,690
what I know you'd ask yourself you know

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,739
what the hell does that have to do with

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,170
a SF it turns out that as long as you're

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,269
building software that gets deployed

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,220
everywhere there are people that are

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,570
running it at scale there are people

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,510
pushing the envelope with your software

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,180
some of the software at the asf you

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,220
really really see that with right I mean

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,010
httpd seems like a pretty good example

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,430
of a piece of software a piece of

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,100
technology that people have used and

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,590
abused and and made a fortune off of

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,600
right I mean it really powers a

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,269
basically all delivery of everything

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,160
they do on the internet and there's a

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,049
lot of newcomers as well I mean there's

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,549
there's the engine ix's of the world and

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,310
all the other web servers that are out

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,530
there but Apache still has a pretty

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,580
significant market footprint and the

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,640
reason for that

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,560
because as Jim said the people that

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,390
needed to build a web server they needed

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,600
to build it because their livelihoods

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,060
depended on it right they actually had a

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,870
job to do that they could not do without

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,030
building a piece of software so I I'm a

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,590
very very pragmatic person I don't like

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,840
to solve problems that don't exist I

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,820
don't like to code for the sake of

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,500
coding I like to code for the sake of

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,650
solving something that's real that

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,000
affects usually my life that ends up

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,370
affecting other people's lives as well

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,250
so if you look at all of the projects in

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,590
the asf the ones that go out and

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,810
actually make individual people's lives

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,330
better are the ones that are vibrant and

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,030
successful obviously it's a kind of

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,370
self-reinforcing cycle because the

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,810
community builds around that right if a

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,700
product makes your life better you

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,210
participate in the community that's how

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,970
it works so there's a lot of Technology

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,640
Apache has a lot of this technology and

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,140
a lot of it is really awesome right

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,720
there's a lot of technology that's not

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,340
at the SF that's really awesome there's

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,980
there's there's freebsd there's Linux

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,180
there's there's a Lumos there's mysql

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,600
there's postgrads none of which are at

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,490
the SF pretty awesome technologies when

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,460
you look across the SF we've got some

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,010
great stuff and then I come to the

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,810
pragmatic nature of things we have a

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,390
problem in our industry that things are

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:18,300
so awesome that we tend to lose

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:19,610
ourselves in the technology right and we

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,260
forget what the real world looks like

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,350
they come in and we try to find the

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,270
perfect solution to our problem so one

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,070
of the slides that the gym throwed up

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,870
threw up was really great as community

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,150
created code which is really what we

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,400
have the infrastructure the architecture

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,440
the organizational structure of Apache

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,390
really prevents anything else right so

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,240
you can't not have community created

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,310
coded Apache that's that one's easy

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,530
because Apache did all of the work to

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,460
create a structure that that only

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,530
produces that the other thing was codes

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,970
that that is exceptional and I challenge

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,490
you all to redefine what you think

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,410
exceptional is exceptional is not code

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,190
that's beautiful it's code that works

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,310
one of my colleagues wrote a

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,280
a blog article and one of my favorite

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,520
articles on our site which is your code

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,830
may be elegant but mine works

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,740
and it's a really good article that

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,110
discusses real-world issues around

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,090
writing code is that you do it to solve

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,740
a problem that problem solving it

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,660
tomorrow is not useful if you need to

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,940
solve it today so there are timelines

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,890
there are real situations the

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,430
technological world out there right it's

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,560
an ugly world the HTTP spec is a great

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,350
example of if you wrote an a web server

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,270
that adhered to the spec no one would be

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,030
able to talk to it right it has to be

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,610
incredibly flexible has to comply with

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,770
the spec but all of the shoulds it does

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,420
right it's be very tolerant on what you

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,730
accept and very rigorous on what you

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,500
give right so the idea of building

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,600
software that actually interoperates and

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,430
actually works is much more important

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,260
than solving the problem the right way

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,910
because in the end of the day it's not

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:03,880
right so there's a huge step that we all

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,120
have to take as we grow as engineers and

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,560
software developers that gets this idea

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,210
out of our head that code is our baby

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,160
right I call your baby ugly you can

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,830
punch me in the face if I call your code

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,350
ugly it's code right if your code is

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,210
broken its broken you have no loyalty to

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,890
your code it's just instructions for a

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,180
computer you can give it a different set

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,169
you can give a different set of

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,310
instructions in a different language

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:33,040
right that is not your baby and one of

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,300
the things that I see and we see this at

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,030
our company and we see this all around

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,940
is that people take so much pride in the

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,950
work that they do that they confuse the

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,320
work product that they have with their

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,780
own personal identity all right dumping

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,190
your soul into a project and creating

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,919
something doesn't mean that it is your

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,050
soul right you you can't crush it that

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,440
way take that feedback make it

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,520
constructive try to make it constructive

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,640
but even when you have destructive

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,500
feedback take it as criticism right just

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,540
look at the code reflect on the code and

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,520
say yeah maybe that does suck how could

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,650
I do it better right how do I do this

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,640
differently what real world problem are

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,650
not solving so I recommend you to not be

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,800
loyal at

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,199
all to code right be real l to the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,889
problems you're trying to solve instead

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:25,650
so we as engineers tend to focus on the

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:28,680
technologies we love as opposed to the

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,840
ones that that actually solve the

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,219
problems better right so fall in love

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,870
with the problems you're trying to solve

00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,880
not with the technologies you used to

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,060
solving them right so we see a

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,000
prevalence of Java in the asf there's a

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,550
huge amount of projects in Java nothing

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,830
wrong with Java but the idea of building

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,400
them in the Java because Java is what

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:53,400
you know is incredibly limiting to the

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,650
way you build product it infuses a

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,540
product with a mentality around Java and

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,490
it's not that there's a problem with

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,709
Java it's that it's a single frame of

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,260
mind so if you involve something likes

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,820
Kayla and and closure I mean they

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,230
actually all even run on the JVM but you

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,050
have this mentality of functional

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,000
programming this mentality of Lisp like

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,410
languages right and all of these things

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,270
come in and they change the way you

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,250
think about problems and you become more

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,880
creative about your problem problem

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,190
solving so awkward honesty is Apache

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,260
project suffer from this we suffer very

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,790
badly from this we're very insular so

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,380
all the projects that we have while we

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,209
have an incredibly good structure to

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,720
develop these projects the project

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:35,970
communities tend to be very insular so

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,370
I'd love everybody to think about we

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,540
have the best forum in the world for

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,010
solving this because we have so many

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,680
people together in one place to talk

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,860
right so we can use apache Khan as an

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,930
opportunity to stretch our communities

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,820
our individual project communities in

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,779
weird ways that make them much better so

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,910
it may sound like I'm saying

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,600
specialization is evil I would say the

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,490
specialization is not an evil thing but

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,339
if it doesn't have a strong balance in

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,529
your project it leads to awkward

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,589
situations for example a love affair

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,760
with a hammer right so there are a lot

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,560
of products out there that look like

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,770
this and i'm sure that board is not

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,110
going to come out that's great and I'm

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,880
really not a fan of perfect being the

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,150
enemy of the good but that's kind of

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,740
just crappy right so this is an

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,180
irrational level affair with a hair

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,680
hammer just because you know how to use

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,610
a hammer doesn't mean you shouldn't

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,180
figure out how to use a screwdriver

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,340
every once in a while and we see this in

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,580
the scalable world as an addiction to

00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,870
specific languages and frameworks

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,030
frameworks in general they're designed

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,710
to solve a person's problem and that

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,870
community forms around it and guides

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,330
that project and they solve a very

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,790
particular use case for a problem and as

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,820
you apply that to a highly scalable

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,800
environment you start to really see the

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,320
glaring differences of that person's

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,270
problem and yours right so they don't

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,830
map one to one there are rough edges

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,960
where you don't have full coverage and

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,610
those rough edges they they're you know

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,240
they're like a million lumen light bulb

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,550
blinding you so your job is really to

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,440
tell a computer what to do right it's

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,060
distilled to that as a software engineer

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,370
you are giving instructions to a

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,540
computer so all of these ideas your

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,000
functional programmer and you're

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,830
thinking about monads that's great but

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,710
at the end of the day like your stuff

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,300
runs today at least in assembly that's

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,730
that's where runs runs a machine code

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,110
your jvm helps you get there or your

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,430
compiler helps you get there or your

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,350
interpreter if you're running Python or

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,480
pearl by the end of the day that's

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,650
what's happening right it don't lose

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,630
touch with that because at the end of

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:43,920
the day anyone can get the computer to

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:46,860
do similar things so are our challenges

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,990
are really big and the reason is because

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,080
you don't as software engineers control

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,460
who runs your product we're so HD BD

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,880
would be a very different project today

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,400
if it only ran like personal websites

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,750
that get 100 hits a month it would be a

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,430
very very different project but that's

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,870
not the case that happens to do with the

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,020
way the project was founded and who was

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:10,770
using it but there are other projects

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:13,740
for example 80s which I in the Apache

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,630
traffic server that serves a lot of

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,990
traffic I would argue it serves more

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,400
traffic than it did when it was released

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,440
yahoo released that originally and and

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,630
there are some some sites in China that

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,700
pushed some pretty insane workloads

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,700
through that product and the things that

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,990
they find out about that are really

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,240
exciting and really healthy for the

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,880
community and they also make us look at

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,320
our code and realize that man its pilot

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,970
right so you're looking at it and and in

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,120
there's you know pride will only take

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,710
you take you you know pride is a good

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,840
thing but but at some point you just

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,370
need to say okay we have a real world

00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,950
problem and we have a solution that's

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,290
not meeting it how do we get there let's

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,300
forget about perfect so it's about

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,610
compromise it's about making products

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,640
that really work because somebody's

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,530
business does depend on it so with the

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,940
growing scale and performance demands

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,800
and all these companies you have

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,570
companies that are running hundreds of

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,770
thousands of servers in each data center

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,710
that they have or two or three hundred

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,940
thousands of servers and they're running

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,920
a SF code on there they're running

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,980
cassandra they're running Hadoop they're

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,960
running httpd they're running 80s

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,640
running all of the Java libraries all

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,470
look I mean half the stuff that you

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,370
installed it's Java is based on commons

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,550
right so that's all there and it's all

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,140
being exercised likely in an environment

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,660
that you have never seen before and

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,850
probably can't even fathom so trying to

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,040
figure out how to get those people into

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,780
your community to feedback how you can

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,990
change the problems you're trying to

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,370
solve is a really good thing to give

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,910
some perspective on this we did a little

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,140
survey of our customers and we took none

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,970
of that we have a whole bunch of

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,010
customers that are in the Alexa top 100

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,270
so we eliminated all of those and we

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,850
eliminated all the customers that have

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,160
less than a million users and we took a

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,830
kind of a swath of the middle our middle

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,080
tier customers and we we did some some

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,600
math and some averages and it turns out

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,490
that a normal medium site in this case

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,360
they have about 50 million users on

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:16,760
average they end up having about 30

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,860
different repos internally not open

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,290
source 30 different repos their teams

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,970
that work on right so they've got your

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,740
your web front-ends when you're back in

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,660
middle where some your finance i'm your

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,770
bi some of this that the other right and

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,150
it ends up you look at it you're lucky

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:34,520
we have 30 repos six different

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,770
programming languages represented so the

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,460
idea is that I run Java because I know

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:42,770
Java it's one of six most likely in a

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,210
medium-sized company so if you chose one

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,830
of the other five you would not have

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,820
actually shaken anyone's tree right so

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,520
the idea of making these things

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,050
interoperate is really really important

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:59,620
and what's really exciting is that we

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,240
see on average 30 put backs into open

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,490
source projects not alter the asf but a

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,340
good number to the asf just because they

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,500
have so much infrastructure there but we

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,500
see put backs into into post grads and

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,030
cassandra and to into mysql not so much

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,170
mice ql anymore I think Oracle did

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:19,480
something but we have we have this and

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,960
that really tells me that the Apache

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,260
model this idea that people could make a

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,390
livelihood off of it it's not GPL not to

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,400
get into a into a license board but just

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,910
the mentality of the apache software

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,310
license it really works it really

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,040
encourages participation and across all

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,470
the the companies that we work with we

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,380
have some companies that are really not

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,210
open source companies and they are

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,400
absolutely fine with every bug fix going

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:51,970
right back to the community so it really

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,440
makes sense to companies three different

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,000
operating systems three different server

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,950
vendors two different networking vendors

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,630
and four different database technologies

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,250
and the first one I think is the kind of

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,810
the weirdest because back in the day

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,970
when I did this you know it started out

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:09,520
15 almost 20 years ago it it was one

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,710
right you you ran MySQL or you ran

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,710
Oracle and you figured out how to do

00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,500
everything with that database and it

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,630
sort of looked like a piece of wood with

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,850
a screw bed and a hammer next to it but

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,400
people are really embracing this idea of

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,010
let me use the right tool for the job

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,320
and the interesting part of all of this

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,440
is that it ends up being provided by a

00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,030
really big team sometimes by a small

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,300
team but these teams are made up of

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,940
smaller teams right so you have this

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,190
large community given a company that's

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,240
got maybe two or three hundred engineers

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,160
nobody has a two or three hundred member

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,510
team right you have a seven-member team

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,430
or five-member team sometimes a

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,010
two-member team that looks a whole lot

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,300
like a SF and you've got this enormous

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,740
community of people that will

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,630
like-minded on how they want to develop

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,290
software and everybody's got these

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,730
little groups so it looks a lot of like

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,650
and these people are addicted to the

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,820
technologies that they know if I go and

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,470
no it's in the hackathon yesterday

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,690
and I could see these tables and it's

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,720
all talking about Java or it's all

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,010
talking about HTTP or and that's you

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,329
know they're just talking about their in

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,470
their zone and that's a really great

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:19,690
thing but yet again if that's only

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,339
that's the only thing that happens there

00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,620
are a lot of products that look again

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,510
like an addiction with a hammer and are

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,570
all too common result of irrational love

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,390
of sync product so stretching that

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:34,330
community and making it more diverse and

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,010
who participates and I'll get to who I

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,930
think really needs to be in that it's

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,680
not really cross-pollination between the

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:45,310
communities as much but this leads to

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,980
really unhappy customers is that is the

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,230
truth right the reason that our products

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,630
at the asf are successful is because

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,000
people use them to deliver value to

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:58,270
other people why we build infrastructure

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,590
products occasionally there's a

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,090
developer product right there's a

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,100
product that's really designed to

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,260
deliver value directly to the person who

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,880
uses it but almost all of the products

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,890
are leveraged in a way where someone

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,110
takes the product and delivers value to

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,820
yet another person so you they are all

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,530
of the real value generation of the

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,980
products being run is is a second

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,790
derivative and we have to be focusing on

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,470
that end user experience that's that's

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,120
where that value is that's where you

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,410
change lives that's where the world gets

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,320
better and the interesting part is that

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,990
unless you're that person serving that

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,150
traffic to that end user your

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,530
perspective isn't good enough so

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,660
technological complexity is evil right

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,340
everybody says so old rule keep it

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,760
simple stupid right everything should be

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,710
as simple as possible this is a rule so

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,030
don't ever violate this rule please I've

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:58,600
looked at some projects and it's like oh

00:18:52,030 --> 00:19:01,660
my god however in our current systems at

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,820
scale technological complexity is an

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,770
emergent behavior of the business

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,810
requirements that drive them our

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,730
businesses are changing quickly we're

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,210
adding new features and functionality

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:16,390
not too soft corporate to business

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:21,470
screams all right did it cut out yep

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:23,600
okay oh it's back okay good all right so

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,850
it's it's an emergent behavior of the

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,260
way businesses run and if you don't

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,730
think that your business runs that way

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,899
then just wait and it'll probably go out

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,200
of business and you'll hire somewhere

00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:37,580
else but the way we deliver on the

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:41,779
internet today is incredibly hostile II

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:44,649
competitive so this is going to happen

00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:48,100
that complexity one of my one of my

00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:51,289
friends Brian Cantrell he described this

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,289
this aquarium emergent behaviors of

00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:58,789
failure so I went to aquarium and the

00:19:54,289 --> 00:20:00,770
Sharks kept dying right like sharks

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:02,330
don't have predators really I mean they

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,659
just really don't have predecessor in an

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,490
aquarium it's like everybody's puzzled

00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,539
you're looking and although all the the

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,500
biologists are there and they're like I

00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,929
don't know what the hell is happening

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,940
like this every I come in at night every

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:16,940
week we have like a shark that's just

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,309
dead and floating in the aquarium like

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,559
what's going on this is set up cameras

00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:24,350
and they're looking at it and completely

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:27,529
unexpectedly this octopus would get

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,659
pissed off and strangle shark and it's

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:30,950
like why would you why would you do you

00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,049
don't eat it right i mean it was just

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,260
like I don't know is it ornery all right

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:38,690
so it was this really weird behavior and

00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,090
and he likes to say that you know when

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,460
things go wrong octopus man just came up

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,899
out of nowhere and a lot of times that's

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,179
that that's what technical debt looks

00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:48,890
like you know you're going along and

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,409
then suddenly you realize oh that

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,950
mistake that's now now I feel it right

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:57,020
that's the wound and complexity works

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,760
exactly that way so as your systems

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,230
become highly decouples you're running

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,399
for different database technologies in

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,490
six different languages and they're all

00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:07,370
talking to each other that complexity it

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:10,429
exists because your velocity to deliver

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:13,039
business solutions would be too small it

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:17,840
would be too slow to compete without

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:20,539
them so relative correctness just a real

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,630
quick detour on on relative correctness

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,350
we worked with a company that sold stuff

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,610
online

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,780
so probably sure you've heard of

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,230
companies that sell things online is

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,299
really popular they sold a lot of

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,770
different things there were it was kind

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,809
of an auction site sort of thing we're

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,450
so we're as a user of the site i can

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,830
upload my goods for sale so when i go to

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,360
the front page of the site they're

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,190
promoting new items they always want to

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
see the newest items you know what are

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,220
the newest upload is the most popular

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,110
right so they had been dumping this

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,919
stuff into a technology that uses

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,150
leucine underneath and they're looking

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,010
at it and there were two things that

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,890
happen here one the leucine search

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,080
engine was not quite fast enough and

00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,270
they were looking at the graphs and it

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,220
was like ha you know it's doing it's you

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:09,440
know doing was it 800 I ops a second on

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,590
the box and this was before the time of

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,390
SSDs and we're looking at we're like

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,679
okay well they're like it's it's taxed

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,240
we need to grow the cluster we need to

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,179
buy like 16 more machines we only have

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,640
four bump it up to 20 will be set we're

00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:24,049
looking at it I'm like okay how how much

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,830
data do you have and they're like well

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:29,600
the leucine index is 18 gigs I'm like

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,850
okay well how much bram do you have well

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,549
we have 16 gigs like okay well you know

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,750
if you had 32 it all fed first you'd

00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:37,520
never hit this so it wouldn't be a

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,830
problem not a infinitely scalable

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,720
solution clearly but that'll work but

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,799
800 I ops like what kind of boxes are

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,809
those and they're like oh they just have

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,200
two drives in them what kind of drives

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,280
can you get that will give you 800 I ops

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,870
and they're like well I mean that's what

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,210
the system says I'm like ice not what

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,830
physics says dude right that's not how

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,230
that works like they're not that fast

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,640
you can't buy drives like that and they

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,480
look at it and then looking at the graph

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:06,200
and like it says 800m dude 800 million

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,000
if's a second right so there was a Miss

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,130
Reed there but there was this like

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,409
detachment from the full stack of the

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,960
system all right the person running the

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:16,309
the the loosing code there the person

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,140
responsible for search index saying

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,320
they're looking at this problem and

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,450
they're not accepting of the fact that

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,220
computers how do they work right you've

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,260
got all this stack everything you do

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,179
runs on a computer runs on storage it

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,000
runs on spinning disks run on SSDs they

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:34,309
all have parameters right and everything

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,659
that you solve has to fit within those

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,820
parameters or the big

00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,999
red flag a comes up and goes

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,950
hey there's something wrong and keeping

00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:46,200
that in mind is really important so the

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,999
funny irony is that you know so the

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,369
search index guy as soon as he was you

00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:52,739
know reminded how computers work oh yeah

00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:54,450
look at that we're not text still not

00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:56,399
fast enough right so maybe it's not an

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,109
eye ops issue but we don't have the

00:23:56,399 --> 00:24:02,279
latency is too high or throughputs too

00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:05,639
low we have to serve this search query

00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:09,509
on every home page load that's like okay

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:10,739
well why well you know it has to be up

00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:13,139
to date it has to be the most recent

00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:14,639
data now if anybody's ever worked in

00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,139
distributed systems you realize there is

00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:20,399
no most recent data there is no truth

00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:22,799
right nothing is ever correct so what do

00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:25,109
you mean it has to be current like well

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,330
if someone uploads the you know the the

00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,950
thing to the site like they need to be

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,419
able to see their own stuff I'm like

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,399
well first it only needs to be correct

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:35,220
for the person who made the change but

00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,479
but how correct does it need to be so

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,759
well we talked to the business and we

00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:41,129
said we want to cash it we want it to be

00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,659
out of date and if it's out of date we

00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:44,639
can save you a lot of money it's like

00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,049
okay well did you define out of date and

00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:47,940
they're like well not current

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,849
everything's not current or going in

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:54,479
loops so went into the business and said

00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:57,960
if I can serve that page one second old

00:24:54,479 --> 00:25:00,479
I can take your 20 servers instead of

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,070
going to 100 I can go to two and they

00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:09,179
said one second is now and then you like

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:12,779
this light bulb right so you have this

00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:15,419
issue where as technical people we think

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,179
in gigahertz in nanoseconds and business

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,489
people think in days or hours or minutes

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:22,440
very rarely seconds so this idea of

00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:25,109
things being old there like five minutes

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,269
is not old right and then you're

00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:28,769
thinking about caches you put 80s in

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:30,539
front of it and I can do three hundred

00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,700
thousand requests a second and you know

00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,049
it's like done next problem right so we

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,720
didn't even solve it we just removed the

00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,239
problem so and that has to do with

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,519
people building technologies and trying

00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,989
to solve problems without going to the

00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,539
people with those problems to better

00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:47,369
understand them right so as a community

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,809
that's developing your product the

00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:50,100
engagement with your community is not

00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,490
just to get bug reports

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,280
right it's to understand what what is

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,870
your motivation why are using this what

00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,549
are you doing with it what are the

00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,770
problems that you still have how does it

00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:03,390
hurt when you use this product and you

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,340
can build pretty exceptional products

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,760
it's called an engineering pie of pain

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,620
it's good then so this technological

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,179
complexity has to be accepted it has to

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,039
be understood and managed and the

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,660
companies that do this are the companies

00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,330
that really have good technical

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,580
competitive advantage and this is

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:25,289
extremely difficult for specialists to

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:27,210
handle so that's that's the problem with

00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:29,010
being over specialized is that it's very

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,580
difficult to deal with technological

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,820
complexity I gave a talk last year at

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,039
surge and the closing plenary I talked

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,809
about this horrible production problem

00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,429
which I won't go into here because I

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,460
don't want to turn into a therapy

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:47,700
session but it was like a three day long

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:51,030
troubleshooting event where I was in the

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,890
c compiler I had to debug CPP because

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,380
somebody decided would be funny to put

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,960
utf-8 comments in the pearl source code

00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,539
and it stopped compiling for us with a

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,190
compiler upgrade and it all had to do

00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:04,710
with an SSH library that wasn't working

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,570
right and openssl needed to be upgraded

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,880
which changed his api's so like

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:12,120
basically it was the one thread that you

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,570
pulled and the whole you know a blanket

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,679
just came apart it was all three days of

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,159
trying to put it back together it

00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,659
involved hardware Nick bugs with check

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,360
something errors because we couldn't

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:26,549
publish the fixes that the Box couldn't

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,059
send it and the interesting part of that

00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:32,309
was that it took three days because we

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,559
had two people that didn't care about

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:37,580
boundaries and technology they were

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,929
looking at AC problem and live ssh2 and

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,880
then they had an open a cell upgrade

00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:43,500
which didn't go well because then it

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,929
required a pearl upgrade which had a

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,240
problem with cpp and they didn't have to

00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:50,789
say let me gr assign that to another

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,530
team that cares they didn't isolate

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:54,030
themselves right so they were able to

00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,380
cross those boundaries they were able to

00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,320
dive into the kernel they were able to

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,210
dive into the Java code to c code to

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,630
libraries to linkages all of that stuff

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:06,570
they were able to do and it took what at

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,860
at a big company if you look at when a

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,130
many companies but there are a lot of

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,600
large firms that don't make a tremendous

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,480
amount of money but have a lot of

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,420
technology think global 2000 that's not

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,860
finance and they have these huge stacks

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:25,860
that is a 12-week project because I need

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,270
to upgrade to ssh to open a cell and

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,070
that's a security team security team

00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,080
does that oh we have a compiler issue

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,240
hands that to a compiler team or tools

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,650
team hands it back hands it back hands a

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,800
bag somebody is on vacation another week

00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,150
delay that's a 12-week process and you

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,100
have a competitor that can do it in

00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,960
three days you have you have really good

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,600
things happen so that's the value of

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,730
generalists Apache this actually the

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,560
first picture that is Apache the

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:54,840
user group I think yes so we have these

00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,130
isolated groups and they really love the

00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,510
technologies that they have and they

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,390
would like to solve the problems that

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,460
they understand the interesting thing is

00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,180
that we this is not I couldn't find a

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,890
picture so sorry this is not the Apache

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,900
this is a desktop conference but we have

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,700
a lot of people like that we do have

00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,360
pictures from Apache con I couldn't find

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:19,260
them so we have a huge group of people

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:23,780
with an incredibly diverse set of

00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:27,930
knowledge so the inconvenient truth of

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,400
things is that process is required a lot

00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,980
of people really don't like that I see a

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,880
lot of issues on internal mailing lists

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:42,330
yes uh you know your process you're in

00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:44,280
my way process is really really

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,930
important anybody who denies that they

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,210
have processed just refuses to write

00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:51,240
down what they do right so process is

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,950
critically critically important and we

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,500
have it here at the asf and I feel like

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,360
we have just enough which is a good

00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,850
thing so as much fighting this happens i

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,020
think that the process is really

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,760
fine-tuned to the right amount that it

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,530
can get out of your way and still let

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,110
you work within a structure that can

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,680
help you but we do have strong

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:13,590
isolations and awkward honesty ASX is a

00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:16,590
highly dysfunctional but i would say

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,340
that any really positive high velocity

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,380
relationship

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,030
is dysfunctional those tensions between

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,620
all these different groups are the

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,830
unfortunate way we learn from each other

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,300
right so when infrastructure has issues

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,220
delivering something for security

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,990
reasons you just got educated on why

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,050
there are security issues with that sort

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:36,120
of thing so so the way that the asf

00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:38,460
works might look dysfunctional but

00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,130
having seen a lot of organizations both

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,320
commercial and nonprofit I think the a

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,060
sf's dysfunction is not higher than the

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,920
others and it's much much more

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:53,490
productive which is exciting so on the

00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,020
scalability side specialists don't live

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,670
on the high scale edge of applied

00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:01,770
computing you can't do it it doesn't

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,230
work when you're out there and you're

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,840
running software that serves three

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,970
hundred thousand requests a second or

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,330
has two million connected users to a

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:15,750
single box you are pushing on technology

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,340
in ways that your software is not solely

00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,400
responsible for you're going through a

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,890
very very deep stack of and it's

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,840
all the way down right all the way to

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,850
the firmware firmware it's always buggy

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,700
the hardware's buggy on top of that you

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,320
have an OS that's horribly buggy if

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,030
you're lucky you can at least get kernel

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,190
panics and core dumps from it right and

00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,390
then you go above that and you your jvm

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,630
I don't know how many people have their

00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:41,640
JVM sex all at least once a day but we

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,620
have we have segfaults just popping all

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,750
the time in production on JV ohms right

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,790
so like as awesome as the JVM is

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,710
what doesn't work right and that's a

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,540
reality that we have to work through and

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,370
understanding that whole stack I like to

00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,020
think of technology as this big layered

00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,790
cake right you've got your hardware

00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,890
you've got your firmware you've got your

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:06,210
OS you've got your apps you've got your

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:07,980
networking your api's your protocols all

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,480
of that beautiful thing it's really

00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,130
beautiful and we tend to live in our

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,200
little layers but when you go to the

00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,630
edge and you start pushing on things in

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,240
a highly scalable way that layer cake

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,760
gets squished and all the layers mixed

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,370
together and it really doesn't pay off

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,950
to refuse to live in the others right

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:28,530
you have to acknowledge they exist so

00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,110
we've had some really bad 80s stories

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:34,660
and horrible product don't you

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:38,710
so so we we run that and we have these

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,970
weird issues with Malik and I'm going to

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,910
the Mallik issues they're kind of

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:47,830
traumatizing so the IP issues we run 80s

00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:49,750
and it's interesting that we run our 80s

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,760
instances some of the bigger ones on an

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,070
operating system called a Lumos which is

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,940
the you know forgotten child of the

00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,680
opensolaris world after Oracle killed it

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,000
so Oracle took opensolaris and decided

00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,650
that solaris 11 would be closed source

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,080
after they had opened it's the second

00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:08,140
project in the history that that that's

00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,620
happened to very very sad the beauty is

00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,150
is that the open solaris project was in

00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,740
the state where it could be formed it

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,290
was open enough that you could fork it

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,880
move on the ilume most foundation I

00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,440
think they're a foundation now or

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,030
they're in the process of becoming one

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,110
before that there's a whole bunch of

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,400
operating systems about six or seven

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,450
operating systems that are built off of

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,910
illumos we're kind of like Linux really

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,500
interesting problem that turns out that

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:35,020
when you run on the edge you push on

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,660
things that other people don't so our

00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,280
80s instances they peak it not even that

00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,500
high maybe fifteen thousand requests a

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,559
second on a single box but it's

00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,970
incredibly diverse content so we have IP

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,820
addresses coming from everywhere in the

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:51,790
world all over mobile so in a given day

00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,710
we will see somewhere between 30 and 60

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,679
million unique IP addresses coming to

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,890
these systems and it turns out that deep

00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:03,340
in the colonel there is a cache that

00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:05,230
stores path into you so when you make a

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,610
tcp connection and your MTU is smaller

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,679
than what you thought you do this thing

00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:11,320
called path MTU discovery and then you

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,250
say oh you're infuse not 1,500 it's 1440

00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,179
or 14 20 or 1460 or what have you and

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,020
then you have to remember that because

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,850
you don't want have to do all that

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:22,389
process again and there's a cash for it

00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:25,750
and the cash we found up is a 256 bucket

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,940
cash which means that when you put 60

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,159
million elements in a 256 bucket cash

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,980
you have very very long lists in each

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,330
bucket and we were seeing a TCP

00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,850
connection come in and it would take

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,560
four and a half seconds to complete

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,450
where the colonel would do nothing but

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,770
go find to see if it seen that IP

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,020
address before and figure out what its

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,250
path into us

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:51,669
so this idea that i work in 80s and I

00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,350
can make 80s high performance is a very

00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:56,020
incomplete thought process without

00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,550
saying I'm willing to go up and down the

00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,080
stack I'm willing to look at compiler

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,430
bugs I'm willing to look at the assembly

00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,560
the compiler produces I'm willing to

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:05,020
look at the the kernel stack the IP

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,120
stack the networking all around me those

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:10,510
are critical parts to delivering part of

00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,090
the vision of what a DSS so we're very

00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,050
fortunate in the 80s community that we

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,850
have a whole bunch of people who run

00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,640
this and make money off of it and

00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:21,220
have to fix it so we have a very very

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,470
pragmatic group of people and I think

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,480
that when you push the envelope like

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,000
that it's really important to have

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,920
generalists involved in the community so

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,420
it's not so much pulling on all the

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,640
other communities here but finding the

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:39,220
generalists that use the product and

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:42,160
really understanding their feedback so

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,660
your survival depends on these projects

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,090
that run at scale survival depends on

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,560
recruiting generalists now I'll have a

00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,960
caveat and say I think that really

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,580
developer focused tools don't have this

00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,990
issue they don't operate at the same

00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,900
scale they don't need to that's not

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,550
their purpose but i think the other

00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,230
option is to lever leverage the

00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,740
collective intelligence of the asf for

00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,800
this and this is probably the most

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,210
important slide when I wrote it I looked

00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,180
at it and couldn't find a problem with

00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:13,230
it which is pretty rare my opinion is

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,970
that the brain trust at the asf is

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:18,970
unparalleled in the software industry

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:22,270
there is no other community that has the

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:25,180
diversity of brain power that the asf

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,470
has we have and it's not mainly because

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,790
of the diversity of the different

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,290
projects that we work on the different

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,390
languages the different levels of the

00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:34,090
stack from developer tools to production

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,790
traffic service right all of that is

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,220
very very unique we have so many

00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,470
different products and so many good

00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,330
people that produce them we have a brain

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,250
trust unlike any other so the question

00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,850
that I hope that you guys can answer

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,490
over the next two days is how to do that

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:54,220
because I don't have an answer to that

00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,870
but I feel like we are the people to

00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,770
solve that problem you cannot collect a

00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,840
better group

00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,840
people's on the problem and that's it

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,690
thanks very much do I presume you're

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,559
prepared to take questions I could I

00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:28,470
mean I have answers does anybody have a

00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:31,160
question with regards to combating

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:34,200
specialization and creating tools to aid

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,900
generalists are there any technologies

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,609
asf projects or better yet the problems

00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,020
that we could fall in love with that

00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:43,950
they would make you happy if you saw

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,940
more energy dedicated towards that's an

00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:49,619
interesting question I think that

00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:53,280
becoming a generalist is a rather

00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:57,240
personal mission and I think that from

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,760
the very basic level to never take the

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,190
old-school windows IT admin approach to

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,619
any problem where it froze all rebooted

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,869
and it fixed it so we're all good that

00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:09,210
idea of that acceptance of not

00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:11,359
understanding the root cause of a

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,380
problem the pathology of that failure

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,230
you don't always have the time to do

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,150
that you have a product schedule but the

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,500
idea that I mean don't want to tell

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,930
everybody to do everything at home all

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,400
the time but when i leave work and i

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,010
solved a problem and i didn't understand

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,230
the solution to it I don't go to I can't

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,930
sleep like that right I have to

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,220
understand why all right that question

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,130
that that two-year-old three-year-old

00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,839
question yyyy like you should be asking

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,569
that and you shouldn't really be

00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:42,119
satisfied with that answer so we have

00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:44,220
the tools like I said I mean literally

00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,140
the entire software stack is all

00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,579
the way down so you have the tools right

00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,520
in front of you right here this thing

00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:53,220
never works to have problems that you

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,859
can explore right so every product that

00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,809
the asf produced has bugs will have bugs

00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:00,990
and every product it runs on does so the

00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:02,579
problems are there and I do think the

00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,990
grabbing was one of the challenges with

00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,520
open source is grabbing someone else's

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,309
bug report is a lot less compelling than

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,990
finding your own just because that

00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:12,420
question of why wasn't your question of

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,180
why but but figuring out how to bridge

00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,770
that gap is somewhat important so really

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,770
just not settling for an unanswered why

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,590
coming across

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,980
introducing myself i'm steve hathaway

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:38,580
I'm my primary employer is Oregon State

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:42,060
Police and I've in charge of the data

00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,380
security and networking for Oregon

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:47,280
criminal justice and law enforcement

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:51,060
access throughout the from Oregon

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:55,380
throughout the entire continent of North

00:39:51,060 --> 00:40:01,020
America and Canada and in my employment

00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:02,880
I'm i'm also a committer for apache but

00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,420
that's not part of my employment that's

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:13,859
my avocation I'm trying to find some

00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:16,980
answers to some big data problems and in

00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:21,140
wrapped around some security problems of

00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:25,290
confidential information that can solve

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:28,950
future issues that will be coming on my

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:35,130
table in the near future one of my data

00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:39,780
systems is about terabytes worth of data

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:43,619
logging and a basic index in sequel is

00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,589
about 270 gigabytes I'm trying to find

00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,630
some architectures where I can refactor

00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:52,890
the data and put it into a different

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:56,490
type of database and improve the search

00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:59,460
performance if I do a basic crawl

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:02,310
through the log files it takes maybe two

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,210
weeks worth worth is searching before a

00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:09,030
fine dancer if I do it through the

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:12,359
sequel database it takes maybe 12 to 20

00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:14,790
minutes I'd like to get the I'd like to

00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,119
be able to have the search be able to be

00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:22,170
done on a key database that I expect to

00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:26,640
grow to about 15 terabytes worth of

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:31,080
index data with a response time of about

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,109
10 minutes are there any Apache tools

00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:37,440
that kind that I can use as a generalist

00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:44,690
to refactor a solution

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:47,760
it's a very specific question so I I

00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:50,010
would say that the confidentiality of

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,569
your information is only a problem if

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,839
it's a confidentiality of the problem

00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:58,410
you're trying to solve so disclosing the

00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,760
architecture and the schema of the data

00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,190
you're storing as opposed the actual

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,349
data you're storing it would likely be

00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,880
enough information for any of the

00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:09,119
projects to understand how their

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,670
solution would apply so two terabytes

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:15,599
and 15 terabytes is is incredibly small

00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:19,079
change for Hadoop it's also small for

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,720
Cassandra really I mean that question

00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,849
you have to understand the scope and

00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,960
size of the data the access patterns of

00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:26,400
it and the questions you're trying to

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,020
ask you need to understand that really

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,359
well before you apply technology to it

00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,619
so at recommending the specific

00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:35,190
technology without understanding that

00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:37,109
would be folly on my part but but I

00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,510
would I would take that information

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:41,670
obviously not the the bad people are the

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,440
good people but the schema and the size

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,780
of them and exactly the questions you're

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,210
trying to answer and they're Layton sees

00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,980
22 like the Cassandra community and the

00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:51,420
Hadoop community because if you touch

00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,339
both of those and they don't have an

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,560
answer that says not me that person or

00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,579
yeah we can do that then you you're

00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:03,290
probably going to run aground anyway so

00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:03,290
it was there a question over here yeah

00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,210
you know the generalization I think when

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,849
you you know when you create an

00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:14,430
environment with the source code to all

00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:16,890
the layers of the stack and you have

00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:19,619
observability tools at different layers

00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:22,859
that are you know reasonably usable or

00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:25,440
approachable dtrace right well yeah I

00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:28,980
mean that's the kind of thing that that

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,390
makes more people generalist right and

00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,030
maybe you don't have the source code

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:35,400
maybe you've got this weird JVM thing on

00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,470
solaris and you know it could be solaris

00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,160
eight in solaris eight has trust that

00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:43,740
will do freaking everything right you

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,569
can start to solve you know you have

00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,569
your problem right but you can you can

00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:50,150
get information that allows someone that

00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:52,460
knows the JVM to

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,440
have something to chew on instead of

00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,329
just another user report right and if

00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,039
you have you have the source code for

00:43:56,329 --> 00:44:00,200
your whole stack right there in your

00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:02,660
development environment then you can

00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,930
take it a lot further right and if we

00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:10,039
can make you know on both sides both the

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:13,520
observability right and the easy access

00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:16,940
to source good structure for that ways

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,770
to navigate through it find things right

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,319
a lot of people a lot more people are

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,779
going to be empowered to solve problems

00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:26,180
across the stack because even if you

00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:28,130
know you can do that you know

00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,930
conceptually right if if they're all

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,730
these barriers to finding out what's

00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:35,119
going on at every layer right and you're

00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,910
hitting yourself on the head every every

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,559
time you go through or another level

00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:41,329
then it's just not going to happen very

00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:42,849
often because you you know you've got to

00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:46,760
find another way to solve your problem

00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:50,210
yep so so to two incredibly relevant

00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,829
comments on that are that the one of the

00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,329
best ways to learn how to use those

00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:55,069
tools is that when you submit a bug

00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:56,089
report ask the person you fixed it to

00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:58,160
walk you through the steps of

00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:59,510
remediation so there's a lot of times

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,069
where you submit somebody a core file

00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,319
and they just say oh yeah I fixed it

00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:05,029
like well how did you read it what were

00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:07,279
the commands that you use what tools did

00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:09,740
you use why did you make those logical

00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:12,559
steps in diagnosing the problem and now

00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:14,480
suddenly as a as a Perl program or a

00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,119
Python programmer you actually know a

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,880
lot about debugging a CBM right so like

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,220
the interpreter you start to learn by by

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,490
looking at that and looking at a bug

00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,380
report and the patch is not relevant I

00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,450
mean like unless you can repeat the

00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,640
process to get there and watch several

00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,930
processes like that that's how you learn

00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,029
is to watch that process like a

00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,950
mentorship in a lot of ways and most

00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:38,000
people are once they've solved a lot of

00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,049
people are not really interested in

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,420
doing that while they're trying to solve

00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:43,400
the problem because it's distracting but

00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,260
after they're done they're usually

00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,579
pretty happy to go through and say this

00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,900
is how I solve the problem people like

00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:51,230
to talk about how they solve problems

00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,299
and then the other thing about about

00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,339
observability I'm a big big fan of

00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:56,930
observability I talk a lot about

00:45:55,339 --> 00:46:00,020
monitoring and instrumentation

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,069
observability of products and i think

00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,560
the trace is one of the best

00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:05,590
technologies has been built in

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,180
20 years pretty fantastic technology

00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,330
it's Oracle's bringing at the lenox as

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:14,260
well so it really runs on every OS now

00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:17,200
and the interesting part that I found is

00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,850
once i had DTrace I did realize that

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,290
it's much like an Oracle if you ask it a

00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,870
stupid question you get an incredibly

00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,340
relevant and stupid answer so you have

00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,710
to be able to construct your questions

00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,390
well and that requires understanding the

00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,980
whole stack and seeing the source code

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,510
so you need to be able to see source

00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,240
code for your drivers and your kernel

00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:37,240
and your application which was the main

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,400
killer for me for for Oracle closing

00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,350
open solaris into solaris 11 is that

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,930
they just took the most powerful tool

00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,210
that has ever been created in the last

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,400
20 years for computing in my opinion and

00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,680
they neutered it for their own platform

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,810
which was cycle what are you doing right

00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,520
so but they're bringing it to linux and

00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,440
you have the source code to linux so you

00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,260
can really start to tailor incredibly

00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:03,040
intelligent questions to understand when

00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:05,110
your when your product does XYZ how many

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,360
minor fold hits do I get how many page

00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:09,130
swaps do I get when do I go to disk how

00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,780
far does it seek like all sorts of

00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,730
really interesting cross stack questions

00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:16,680
so it's a great tool for really

00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,680
exploring the world of applied computing

00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,850
okay one at the back of the room coming

00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,740
over Jim well I'm getting there Theo I

00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,790
wonder do you do you think that the open

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,930
source community can continue to scale I

00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:32,230
think it has a better chance than any

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:33,640
other community so I'll punt on that

00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:37,480
question but say if we're doomed

00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,850
everyone else is yep my question was

00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,160
basically I mean don't you think that

00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,630
part of the problem had been that it had

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,860
been kind of like impossible to be a

00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,930
generalist because you didn't have

00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,940
access to all the bits and pieces that

00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,370
allowed you to to look at all the

00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:55,470
different layers and as a corollary to

00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:57,940
that is that a really good rationale for

00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,880
baselining open source at all layers

00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:03,640
because it allows you to be the generals

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,040
that you need to be I think that having

00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,810
open source at every layer enables

00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,090
becoming a general was much better than

00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:11,700
than any other platform you're always

00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:15,130
going to be stuck with some little bit

00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,640
but it's actually amazing to understand

00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,710
if

00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,480
you know the Linux kernel well and you

00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,070
understand how its subsystems work and

00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,600
you've trouble you no trouble shots on

00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,210
the stuff that happens there it's

00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:28,510
amazing how you can intuit how AIX works

00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:30,460
where H bucks so I think even if you're

00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,110
not running the open source which I

00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,310
think if you can and if it fits you

00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:36,430
should definitely use it because the

00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:39,400
advantages are tremendous but even

00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:41,590
knowing the open-source counterpart to

00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,300
that so understanding how postgres works

00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:45,100
gives you an incredible amount of

00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,160
insight to how oracle actually works the

00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,930
oracle database so it's a database right

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,330
it's built off the same academic papers

00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,310
right all of that stuff is there so you

00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:56,980
actually see a manifestation of code and

00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:58,150
like I said it's when you build code

00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,400
you're just telling a computer what to

00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,380
do so the C code may be different maybe

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,910
in a different language but the data

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,860
structures and the approaches and and

00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:13,470
how it interacts with with a computing

00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:13,470
platform are highly similar who's next

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:28,910
one problem i found when I've tried to

00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:32,120
be a generalist is I can get out of my

00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:33,500
depth quite quickly and then I really

00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,060
don't know what I'm doing what advice

00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,800
would you give to people in the room who

00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,630
want to become more generalists about

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,760
how to cope with getting out of their

00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:43,040
depth when trying out new things and

00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:47,120
moving outside their comfort zone I

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,000
think that's a great question this the

00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,850
specialist will never die it will always

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,830
be specialist even a lot of generalist

00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,170
actually have a specialization in one

00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,760
place or another the best organizations

00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,200
that I see are a whole bunch of

00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,930
specialists that decided not to be

00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,580
specialists anymore and it's you can

00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,200
decide not to be but you're still like

00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,260
awesome at that one thing even though

00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,480
your broad so if you have a company that

00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,790
has a lot of people there is likely a

00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,520
specialist that can help you in that out

00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:18,710
of your depth moment and if not there

00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,870
are specialists in every community in

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:22,940
the asf there are specialists in that

00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:24,500
product so if I'm out of my depth they

00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,960
do there's no better place than the hoop

00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,390
community to go so there's a lesson

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,110
especially in the asf and other open

00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,210
source of organizations and projects I

00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,860
think it's it's not difficult can be a

00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:39,110
little intimidating and it can be a

00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,810
little sprawling to try to collect all

00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,370
of those things but they are there it

00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,800
helps when you have a rapport with the

00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:47,770
people so if you can do it within your

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,820
your own organization that's even better

00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:51,740
because then someone's going to come to

00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:56,180
you for the same thing and that's what

00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:59,140
collaboration is really good okay we've

00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,440
only got time for one more question ah

00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,440
yeah will

00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,890
for that for the record we talked a lot

00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,450
about being able to when you're a

00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,950
general generalist being able to find

00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,380
the resources of the specialist for that

00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,640
particular part a lot of this is

00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,840
available in open source because we're

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,910
all in the open we all have open e

00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,250
mailing lists but how do you ask the

00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,260
effective question to actually get the

00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:27,320
experts who you don't know in the Hoopa

00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:30,020
community to put sought and time into

00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,150
helping you out and answering you so

00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,960
there's my other business actually sell

00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:37,910
magic eight balls no I don't have the

00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,440
answer to that I mean when you're out of

00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,960
your depth to the point where you can't

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,160
formulate a question it's probably

00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,100
better to formulate the problem

00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,420
statement so the problem statement which

00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,730
is slightly different than the question

00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,650
so I'm trying to solve this problem and

00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,910
I've gotten to this point and I'm just

00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,800
stuck I don't even know the next

00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,810
question to ask because if you give

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,980
someone enough context then then likely

00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,420
they'll be able to assist you to

00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,650
construct that that more specific

00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:06,640
question maybe one more if anyone has a

00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:09,620
question otherwise we can take out

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,320
coffee break okay ladies and gentlemen

00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:16,030
will be moving into individual tracks

00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,170
after the break coffee served next door

00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:20,780
if you need to know where anything is

00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:22,970
it's all on this floor apart from lunch

00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,980
will be going upstairs for lunch if you

00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,640
need to any location the signs outside

00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:30,050
every room ask at the registration desk

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,260
Theo schloss nagel's thank you very much

00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,260
indeed

00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,160
