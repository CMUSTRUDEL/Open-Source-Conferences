so thank you for the client interaction

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,589
welcome to my presentation on I was

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,260
voted to be a committer now what I'm

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,170
really happy to see a few longtime

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:21,150
tomatoes and members in the audience is

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:22,800
really i guess i shouldn't so i'm

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,900
happy to see a few members and

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,180
committers here to help me out with any

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,859
questions that actually i might have in

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,940
the presentation so it's going to be a

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,040
little bit more interactive Who am I to

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,649
tell you something about committee ship

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,420
I am software engineer and Nokia working

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,640
on Nokia Maps if you go to maps nokia

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,579
columns which work at categories that's

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,230
what my team does apart from that I

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,160
member at the apache software foundation

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,050
I am co-founder of the Apache mahout

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,960
project whose goal is to build scalable

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,090
machine learning algorithms I happen to

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,020
be co-founder of Berlin Apache Hadoop

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,120
get together as well as Berlin buzzwords

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,430
main reason for that mainly was it I

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
don't like traveling too much so I also

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,729
half the geeks come to me and the other

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,770
way around coming to the interactive

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,750
part how many of you are using apache

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:22,380
product okay pretty much everyone how

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,930
many of you have contributed patch how

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,450
many of those of you have still one

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:33,090
laying around that's waiting to be

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:36,390
polished anyone for those of you who

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,710
wait too long I've got a nice rule for

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,750
you and that is yonex law of patches

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,680
yannick assay is low solar losing

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,180
committee and he has the laws that a

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,520
half-baked patch in JIRA with no

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,979
documentation no tests and no backwards

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,369
compatibility is better than no patch at

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,280
all so better get your patches in very

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,740
early to get feedback you will have to

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,189
change them anyway and you better learn

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,409
how to change it early on before you've

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,440
spent a lot of time on polishing and

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:14,650
making it perfect to your knowledge

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,910
how many of you are commuters okay quite

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:23,410
a few how many of you are PMC members

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:27,459
still money what about PMC chairs few

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:32,410
what about asf members okay so we have a

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:36,070
few new people but not too many I'm

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,650
going to cover four dimensions oneness

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,739
on administrivia that you will be facing

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,970
when becoming a committer I will be

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,980
covering some infrastructure questions I

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,160
will highlight that becoming a committer

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:55,060
is not only about coding but also about

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,300
lots of other talks and finally go

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:03,610
quickly over how to stay motivated and

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:07,450
how to sustain your energy before going

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,390
into detail when you do become a

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,430
commuter you may have lots of questions

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,290
some things may be confusing not all

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,019
those processes of your project may be

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,320
documented don't be afraid to ask

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,239
questions if there's anything unclear so

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,959
far I haven't met a single person who

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,299
wasn't happy to answer questions see use

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,400
a few websites that are helpful to get

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,560
started those are the ones that I got

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,380
sent to me when I became a converter

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,760
years ago one explains how the

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:43,000
foundation in general works that's most

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,430
of the stuff is covered at Apache con if

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,440
you've been earlier to Benson's

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,140
presentation on how the incubator works

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,579
on Nick Burgess presentation on the

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:58,840
Apache way that's mainly what you should

00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,900
know there's special pages for people

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,640
who start contributing there's

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,190
documentation for new computers as

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,730
guides on how to get started and where

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:14,040
to find links to more documentation into

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,350
your infrastructure ok let's get started

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,599
administrivia the first thing that will

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,040
happen to use that someone asks you to

00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,840
sign and a so called I CLA

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,720
a individual contributor licensed

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,180
equipment essentially what that does is

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,700
give CSF the right to use your

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,430
contribution in your code in their code

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,940
reader distributed as part of their

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,620
releases long gotcha here if you are

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,990
contributing to the project during

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,360
working hours your contract may say that

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,450
anything you do drink breaking hours

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,760
belongs to your cooperation we do have a

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,310
special contract here that you can hand

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,110
to your employer to sign it which is the

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:59,030
CC LA and then essentially you're good

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:03,110
they have been people who had issues

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,450
getting sexy CLA signed if you happen to

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,190
have one of these employers don't be

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,040
afraid to talk to you as a committees on

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,950
how they got things settled out on how

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,600
which arguments worked out while I know

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,480
there's even companies who have

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,070
published blog posts on wise a submitter

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:24,740
design ccla so that may help you a lot

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,330
eating that argument especially if you

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,860
are the first person coming up a set

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,390
documents that may be a little bit weird

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:35,900
and as Benson explained earlier today in

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:38,390
historic on the incubator don't even

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,760
bother to ask was a he said you can add

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,890
special sections or remove special

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,660
sections there won't be any changes to

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:50,900
that document if you do have legal

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,030
questions there is a legal mailing list

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,500
post for internal and external questions

00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,710
keep in mind that someone's published on

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,470
the mailing list list they tend to be

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,680
open and archived so your questions will

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,350
be public as well however these archives

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,960
to provide lots of documentation on

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,220
previous questions asked so it may be

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,350
worthwhile to check these out on mailing

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,500
lists that i have found being greatly

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,300
under advertised so many commuters that

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,060
I a pumped into didn't know about it

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,660
it's party at Apache torg it's nowhere

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,910
published it's not archived if I found

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,760
it very handy if I go to a foreign city

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,890
and I don't know any

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,230
to just send an email to that list

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,120
asking who's out there who is happy to

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,270
have a beer or coffee with me and

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,560
usually people will answer so I went to

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,960
Australia to Sydney last autumn I sent

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,030
an email and it took half a week to have

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,490
an Apache dinner set up was five to six

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:59,560
people attend so this mailing list does

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:01,840
work speaking to getting in touch

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,210
personally there are a few events that

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,670
work really well all of you are already

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,980
at Apache corn so that's a very good way

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,640
to get in touch with other commuters and

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,290
to meet people face-to-face it does help

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,990
to be able to put faces to otherwise

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,480
unknown names such encounter just on the

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,150
mailing list and suddenly you understand

00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,150
how these people sort of work and how

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:32,740
things that they tell you on omelet on

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:35,320
the list are meant so get in touch in

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,900
these face-to-face meetings and spectral

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,730
told us earlier is that anything that

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,980
doesn't help them online and on list

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,930
doesn't have hasn't happened that

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,360
doesn't mean that you are discouraged to

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,150
meet other committees personally you're

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,310
just encouraged to get all the

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,930
information that's important for the

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,420
community back to the death list and

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,100
takes a final decision there it doesn't

00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,170
mean that you're forbidden to go out and

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:06,790
have a drink with someone you develop

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:09,690
code with speaking of a next step if you

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,730
are committee chances are is that

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,890
sometime later you do become a member of

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,560
the foundation essentially what that

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,690
means is not much more than getting

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:26,130
another to mailing list to your inbox

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:29,290
being members that embroidered correct

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,150
whether you want them or not in addition

00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,760
you get access to a few internal lesbian

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,830
modules containing contractual stuff you

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,290
do get to vote new members in you to get

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,000
to vote on the board you do get the

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:44,420
chance to become actually a board member

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,889
and get yet more work to do so how do

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,990
become a member how do you get these

00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:50,149
more mailing males into your inbox you'd

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,260
simply stay with a project to cross

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:56,029
project work helpfuls infrastructure and

00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:01,940
usually it happens very faster than you

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:06,860
ever imagined ok speaking of helping

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,990
with infrastructure see once you get it

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,029
become a commuter essentially you get

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,190
commit access to your project either

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:16,190
through as we are nor circuit depending

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,500
on what you work on you get a very fancy

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,730
email address being unit username at

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,310
Apache torg right thing you get ssh

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,279
access to people at the patchy org which

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:31,190
is a service that's at the u.s. west

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,970
coast favor member correctly so if you

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,240
ever need a server outside of whatever

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:42,260
your company networks it might be handy

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,470
someday you do get a nice rapper to us

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,800
if you needed people Apache dog / your

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,839
own username depending on your project

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,880
you may get access to continuous

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,370
integration systems like Jenkins for

00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,079
instance you may get elevated privileges

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,760
on 0 so that you can get new like and

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,640
needs so that you can Adam can

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,260
administer the project all stays the

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:13,910
same essentially is your jira or

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:16,519
bugzilla account your accounts etc who

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,910
provides that infrastructure there is a

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,630
team of volunteers and paid people

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:25,820
providing all the infrastructure you can

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,970
find more find out more about the team

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,430
if you go to the webpage it and you can

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,890
check out in for a volunteer to find out

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,850
more or you can check out infrared

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,120
Apache talk I have been tools that help

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,120
is always welcome Benson mentions this

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,740
morning's that just say I want that new

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,970
technology and I'm going to do it

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,970
doesn't really get you some new

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,339
technology but volunteering to put some

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,769
work into it at least raises you your

00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,600
chance

00:10:52,769 --> 00:11:00,029
to get stuff done just going there to 20

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,559
and saying I want the technology and I

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:07,170
wanted two morrow probably isn't going

00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:09,540
to get it done there is an infra part on

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,329
Twitter's it shares details when stuff

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,369
goes blatantly wrong is mailing lists

00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,649
that inform you on what's going on

00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:18,929
there's a web page that's usually

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,999
helpful which is monitoring Apache org

00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:27,689
to find out if Gio eyes were really down

00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:33,239
or if it's just your connection um so

00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:34,589
topic it's not only about coding the

00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,749
first things that you can help your

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,749
project worth is to help get the word

00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:42,649
out that may mean if you do have

00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:46,019
connections to your local press help

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:49,829
gutsy release and change log messages to

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,670
those publishers it may be worthwhile to

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:56,129
coordinate that was present Apache dorg

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:59,339
celica dairy who is at the Patrick ones'

00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,829
time is usually very open if you go to

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,899
her if you either have someone who has

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:06,509
general questions on the foundation or

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,970
if you need help was writing a press

00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:11,249
release like finding out what's what

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,089
belongs in to the press release how to

00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:18,029
do that and help you out if you do have

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,799
a personal blog do use it post about new

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:24,809
releases post about features about

00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:29,879
design and help spread sees news in the

00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:32,459
community also getting a bit frizzy

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,499
cheesy coding level it's not only about

00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,749
writing code anymore when you are

00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:39,559
committed you do get that special

00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:42,449
commitment but there are still

00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:46,009
contributors set of ear i'm sending in

00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:50,939
jira set ascending in patches ruggiero

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:52,889
so it's important to give some feedback

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:55,619
on their code it's important to give

00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:57,269
some feedback on your design it's

00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:59,939
important it's important to give that

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:04,899
feedback rather rapidly to take a patch

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:09,459
to apply it to your code base to test it

00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:14,050
and to give feedback in a timely manner

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:17,290
if I work on a work project I do a patch

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,019
I send it in and half a year later I may

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,939
get feedback on what works and what

00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,559
doesn't work I may already be assigned

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:26,379
to a different project and have no

00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,119
longer the cycles to do what needs to be

00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:33,869
done to get that patch in so it's really

00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:33,869
important to get quick feedback to users

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,600
helpful documentation as Noreen pointed

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:43,360
out earlier in the trek helpless writing

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,869
books blog posts on the questions on the

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,819
mailing list and in general an able

00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,970
people by pointing them to the right

00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:54,610
documentation it's not helpful to give

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,069
some the complete solution over and over

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,619
again such as this additional work on

00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,540
your side but it's also not particularly

00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:04,420
helpful if you tell them to redefine

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,749
manual because they may not need know

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,939
which page to look at so it may be very

00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:12,129
important to point them to the exact

00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:16,089
point page or to tell them how to get

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:18,910
there and while you are at it it may be

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,309
important to ask them what's age right

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,160
to find that documentation in order to

00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:28,149
fix your ways of accessing set

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,629
documentation you can help out was

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:35,920
moderating mail of mailing lists you can

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,990
help out in the incubator so essentially

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,929
sharing your knowledge of the foundation

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,230
to new project teaching them how things

00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,230
work

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:54,640
so on motivation first and foremost so

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,709
that relates essentially to Deb

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,230
Nicholson's presentation earlier today

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:03,370
it's very important to know when to

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,200
delegate so it's important to keep in

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,440
mind that you should enable your users

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,610
you should provide documentation

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,430
essentially not only on the code but

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:15,310
also on the processes how do you do pet

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,370
reviews what do you do before releasing

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:21,130
what do you do in order to release these

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,860
kinds of documentation help others who

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:28,029
want to take over your work at a later

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,040
stage you can save some work because

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,680
there's a patch evite documentation just

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,300
usually applies for cross-project

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,220
policies just linked to it another thing

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,140
to keep in mind is to keep the build

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,630
simple and fast so that people that are

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:47,829
new to it to your project can easily set

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:50,829
up and can get started so set something

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:53,199
to work on you can work to encourage

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:55,660
people to submit patches if someone

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,449
comes along and say say there's a little

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,310
typo in the documentation encourage them

00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:03,459
to provide a first patch which usually

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:07,570
is their first step into your project

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:11,260
and which usually is your first way of

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:14,560
getting a new helping hand there if you

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,540
quickly of course delicate try to get

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,459
delegate work to others instead of

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,910
volunteering over and over again and

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:24,760
probably over-committing and one thing

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,649
that usually works so at least at my

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,019
hood we gets up very often is that

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,810
people come to the list and ask hey I

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:33,940
want to help out what can I do on things

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,519
that helps out there is to have a list

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:40,510
of predefined issues that are marked as

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:44,769
appropriate for beginners so essentially

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:47,980
in when was the 2011 after Patrick on we

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,740
did a Hadoop hackathon in Berlin and we

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,670
had Jacob home and come in and a few

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,440
others both committees users so we did a

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,630
list of stuff that people would want to

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,550
work on

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:04,680
essentially some bucks to fix some

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:08,819
components that people wanted to use and

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,550
Jacob made the proposal to teach people

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,220
to submit a patch teaching people to

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:18,449
submit a patch in that case meant

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:21,360
nothing Wars and taking beginners issues

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,970
in the issue tracker and those issues

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,180
really were just about please fix the

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:30,600
typo in that documentation please fix I

00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:33,570
don't know a very little thingies that

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,600
doesn't break see built if you make

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:39,720
anything wrong what was interesting to

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,930
see was most of the attendees were

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,270
either seasoned software developers all

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:49,170
they came from university working on

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,680
their PhD studies they were very

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:54,300
interested in going through that process

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,040
so you may be certain open source

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,080
developers sometimes we forget that

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:03,570
there are people out there who have no

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:06,570
clue on how the tool patchworks so some

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:11,010
of them even don't know how to submit

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:14,490
that patch to a project let alone know

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,680
how the process afterwards looks like

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,600
like what does it commit or do in order

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,990
to get it in what does the release

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,090
process look like afterwards so it may

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,520
be worthwhile to teach people who do

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,950
have decent coding knowledge to

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,370
understand how we work and to teach them

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,770
I mean after all it's not very hard what

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,510
we do it's not very complicated so it

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,490
may just be vers well to teach them how

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:48,030
it works another thing to get motivated

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,760
us to get in touch with others use local

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:54,600
meetups use conferences go for a beer

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:58,290
after hours just get to talk to people

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,020
who are in the same situation would also

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:04,730
develop free software also contribute

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,730
say to Apache projects

00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,690
don't work away in your lonely offers

00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:15,279
but do you have some people to bounce

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:18,009
idea of ideas of so it helps a lot to

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,850
either meet in person or at least posts

00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:26,730
easy online also if you do need help ask

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:29,559
early if you do need help in person and

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,529
say there is no meet up near you create

00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:34,690
one of these meetups usually at least in

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:37,330
my experience they tend to explode

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:40,409
pretty quickly so I've seen a few meters

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:43,210
in Berlin start with 5 to 10 people and

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:45,429
after three months they will like 30 to

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,940
50 and after years they may turn into

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:51,580
your conference Oh made maybe that's

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,259
just my experience but that kind of

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:58,149
Rick's there because they have a very

00:19:53,259 --> 00:20:00,570
vibrant startup so scene if you don't

00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:02,740
know anyone near you at trust me

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:08,830
likelihood is very high so there is

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,690
someone at CSF at sikh community

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,820
development projects there is a

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,480
committal maps that you can use that you

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:19,149
can query with your exact location and

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,950
query for commuters that I near you so

00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:26,409
that may be helpful to find like-minded

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:28,570
people also keep in mind that what

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:30,070
you're working on is not a product

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,129
that's going to be shrink wrap wrapped

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,539
and shipped to customers it's a project

00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:37,600
so it's important to keep in mind that

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:40,950
if there are issues use the opportunity

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,600
to motivate people to contribute back

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,869
patches welcome may not be easy most

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:51,429
inviting sentence so it's very commonly

00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:54,059
used what does help is telling people

00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:56,379
that come with issues such as what is it

00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:00,129
implementing that very feature would be

00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:03,940
a very valuable contribution at least if

00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:06,759
you do mean it so it doesn't help to

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,730
promise new features as part of us a

00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:14,200
road map if you don't cannot stick to

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,909
that very roadmap and at least open

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,770
source projects that I know have the

00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,630
tendency

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,610
not sticking to the road map because

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,940
essentially you are not the boss of

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,560
these people so they decide on what they

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,200
want to work on during their free time

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,690
say decide on which features they want

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,870
to spend their free time on if you want

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,820
to impose work on them it's very easy

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,430
for them to say okay that's just my free

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:42,720
time that's not fun anymore goodbye then

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:45,990
is that doesn't give you anything so do

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,970
hand off work but keep in mind that you

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,640
what you are dealing was essentially is

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:56,220
not subordinates but it's equal

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,710
volunteers what does help people draw

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,980
people in we've had that earlier in this

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,190
track is to say thank you over and over

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,170
again thank you is the one currency that

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:12,540
comes for free so essentially it's like

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:15,060
money printing often times then saying

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:19,320
thank you really is all you can hand out

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:22,230
as a reward I once was offered some

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,360
itunes whatever vouchers for patch I did

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:30,120
but that was just one time not in the

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,980
asf though but really more Elm playing

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,100
thank you publicly as much more volume

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,710
motivating than any monetary reward that

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,630
you may get so you can give credit in

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,970
the issue tracker tickets you can give

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,520
credit in publications in the commit

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,170
message you do have release notes if you

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,820
do have a new section on your website

00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,710
and you do have someone who contributed

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,740
a major feature put their name next to

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,620
it so it was very scary but also kind of

00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:01,200
nice for me to see my name next to Tom

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:03,240
kept patch years ago also when you do

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,770
give credit series the difference

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,190
between saying good job and specifying

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,840
precisely what was good about it if you

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,820
are precise it's much more believable

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,740
for the one who did contribute that

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,740
patch said what he did was valuable

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:29,410
one morning don't take on more work than

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,860
you can accomplish we are all volunteers

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:35,140
we all would love to help we would all

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,390
love to fix all the bugs in our issue

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,880
tracker however there is limited time

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:43,450
unfortunately the date only has 25 now

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:47,260
24 hours also I would of course love to

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:49,450
have it more hours don't go forward and

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,580
commit you're fixing bucks or adding new

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:54,760
features said you don't have super

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:58,960
interest to work on what happens if you

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:02,350
do that is a you get overloaded with

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,170
work but be many others will refrain

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,150
from even looking at that issue because

00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:10,570
essentially you volunteer to do it and

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,750
essentially because you want to do it so

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:21,610
they will not want to stop you from

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:23,920
doing it if you have happened to have

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,840
stepped up for something and you don't

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,210
have some rentals anymore either you've

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,890
committed to too much or your life has

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,810
changed and you don't have the time to

00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,630
do it anymore don't be afraid to step

00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,280
back to tell the community hey I've want

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,530
you to do that I don't have the painful

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,980
anymore please can someone else take up

00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:44,260
the thread on the other end of the

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,020
spectrum if someone in your community

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,350
goes and say is that they don't have the

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,670
benthos anymore don't go and punish them

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:54,100
essentially what they've done is to

00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,900
unlock some of these issues and give

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,970
them back to you for someone else to fix

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,540
sure it would have been better to get

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:04,990
that patch in but it's much more

00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:13,390
efficient in that in that situation to

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:16,270
kind of nourish a a feeling of you don't

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,630
get punished if you do make a mistake so

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,760
it's much more rewarding to motivate

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,130
others to do the same if they are in

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,540
that situation instead of making the

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:31,049
problem much more grave essentially

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:36,529
that's about don't overcommit doing

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:36,529
don't fall victim to volunteer ages

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:44,309
sometimes it may be necessary to simply

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,700
get out get some fresh air it may be

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,739
helpful to go offline from time to time

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,779
it might be helpful to tell any

00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:53,519
communities that you're offline now so

00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,429
they don't expect you to react for the

00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,879
next three to four to five weeks

00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:03,929
otherwise they may wonder what happened

00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:07,019
we've had males go to New father's where

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,809
the sender would worry about what

00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:11,580
happened to him well usually it takes a

00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:17,789
while until they get back online and

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:20,429
it's just fine if life changes a lot and

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:23,639
maybe you are no longer too interested

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:25,739
in the project or you are no longer you

00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:28,139
no longer have the cycles to really

00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:31,769
spend time on that project there's a way

00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:33,570
out you can go Emory toes it's handled

00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,299
slightly differently for each project

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,220
but usually it means that you get your

00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:42,929
commitment taken away at least

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,119
temporarily you may vote to still remain

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,999
active on the mailing list or at least

00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,919
read it and have access to it

00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:52,769
essentially at Apache we do have such

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,749
rules that merit doesn't go away so at

00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,460
any point in the future where you decide

00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:59,159
I do have some time and I do have C

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,480
cycles again it can come back and you

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,340
can continue contributing to the project

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,859
so essentially my message to use that

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,080
there's a lot of fun waiting for you

00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:12,570
this is an amazing community to help you

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,230
and you can meet some of these people in

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,210
the coming two days however you should

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,080
make sure to keep a sane work-life

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,999
balance and for that i would like to

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,799
invite you to come part of see Apache

00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:27,960
community become a committee of some

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,419
project if you do have a problem with

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,970
some apache software and if you do use

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,149
it i'm pretty sure that you'd have one

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,580
more another problem with it just

00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:41,970
scratch your own each is the best way to

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,910
get involved just take the libraries

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,100
that doesn't work quite as well for you

00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,410
as it could fix the issues you have with

00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,620
it even if it's just documentation

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,330
issues get these fixes Beck that's the

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,170
safest way to become a committee over

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,420
very soon usually maintaining your own

00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:02,690
Fork is way more expensive than getting

00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,480
a patch in yeah sure it is some work to

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:09,170
polish stuff yeah sure it's work to get

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,240
feedback put into your patch but in

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:14,710
general it's much much it's much cheaper

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,570
to have such patch maintained upstream

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,250
also it's very valuable to get reviews

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,890
and feedback from people with a broader

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,930
understanding of the project so your

00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,480
changes may work now but you may not

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,820
have an idea of seeing plication Zhaan

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,430
the project as a whole so you may not

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,860
have taken into account some of sea side

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,750
effects that your changes have so

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,270
getting that feedback may be very

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,550
valuable in to stabilizing your changes

00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:44,510
and into not running into surprises

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:54,080
later on and with that I'm happy to take

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:59,930
any questions no questions yes I'm can

00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:04,880
you use a microphone please so going

00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:07,460
back to the it was providing mentorship

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,550
for our patches that come in something

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,010
that came up for today at lunch with a

00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,530
couple of people was just that you can

00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,050
assign people who promised to mentor a

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,100
particular issue through to completion

00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:22,050
what do you think of that as a strategy

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,660
as opposed to having say some of use

00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:27,900
a community of people that sort of

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,450
promised at on Moz I think that's a very

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:34,530
good idea speaking of mentoring is also

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,750
and so first of all having a mentor for

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:40,350
specific back patches may be very good

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:42,480
to get feedback quickly it's all so

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,850
having that concept concept of mental

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,550
mentorship auto also helps to get new

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,890
people in this into the project we've

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,340
seen good success with google Summer of

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,200
Code and summer where essentially you

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,420
get a student and you have a dedicated

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,960
mentor assigned to zed student not

00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:03,420
necessarily was the same technical

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,060
background but essentially helping them

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,920
through the process navigates a project

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,770
navigate how working in that project

00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:14,340
works so having that kind of dedicated

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:21,000
one face assigned to you may help get

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:24,780
you across the first boundaries yes when

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,440
it comes to patches a different apache

00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,780
groups have different ways on

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:35,040
administrative patches if the two that

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:38,490
I'm acquainted with that we prefer that

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:42,700
we prefer that they submit their patches

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:46,600
to jireh and then

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,870
then provide the mentorship back to the

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:55,870
person that is requested Patrick as the

00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:58,410
issue okay so see it was essentially an

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:03,370
addition to the questions there's

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:05,440
multiple ways to multiple multiple ways

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,330
a tas after deal we'll see reviews so

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,250
what you've seen that is that some

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:16,990
projects have assigned my mentors to

00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:19,780
provide feedback for patches not

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:22,570
necessarily aside measures but it

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:25,480
commuters on committees that are

00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:28,570
interested in all of the chairperson

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,670
okay usually also okay so as usually

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,800
sits like a dedicated group who was

00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,800
interested in proving okay yep yep

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,260
that by making this promise as part of

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,720
the

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,420
as part of the issue itself that

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,740
encourages people to participate

00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,540
otherwise would say probably don't

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,450
understand enough about you don't

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,160
understand about the process and so

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,920
these people would actually volunteer on

00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,230
the issue so if anyone I'm fairly

00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,630
certain that if you respond to an issue

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,510
at moose a passion projects that you're

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,520
going to get a response eventually count

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:10,340
somebody but the thing is taking that

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,210
initial step of actually studying on is

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,940
my think

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,490
we're suggesting there's more likely to

00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,350
happen if there was someone who had

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,030
promised in advance care about you

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:27,120
Walter yeah well walk you through this

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:30,630
yep make sense yes oh do you have any

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:35,480
advice on for someone like me who's on

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,480
the PFC and probably chairs

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,080
human advice on how to avoid becoming

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:47,060
the PMC chair I don't have much other

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,190
than telling people that you don't want

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,190
to be and finding someone who's better

00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,790
so what about the other members what's

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:16,640
your 20 so what is it about it this

00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:21,890
here's you know you know the idea is

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,390
that the PMC chair is there at citizens

00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:27,320
before as the eyes and ears of the board

00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,970
basically is the PMC healthy is it

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:33,470
operating and in it in a healthy manner

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:35,510
I know it's a you know and if it is your

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,100
job is simple your job is basically just

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,320
you know every quarter or so sending

00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,120
email to the board saying these are the

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,660
releasees these their contributors and

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,190
stuff like that if you think based on

00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,220
your experience in your background that

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,110
the PMC is not healthy then the board is

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,080
there to help you you know you need

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,810
advisors like that so so big the PMC

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,220
chair is is is some additional

00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,630
responsibility but it's not

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,460
responsibility that you

00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,140
you take one by yourself because there

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,210
are a lot of other people there who are

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,270
able to help you you know associated

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,820
with that you know so don't be scared by

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:13,690
a lot of ways is really into its own you

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:17,030
know to really good indication of your

00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,669
status in the community that they feel

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,159
that you're you know the community will

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,850
not be doing the project well enough

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,330
that they trust you to be able to

00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:33,530
basically be their liaison between the

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:36,230
project and one of the note was for

00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,129
everyone in the room about p.m. CS and

00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:43,520
pse chairs from the point of view of

00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:45,919
running your project a PMC chair in the

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,470
best practice doesn't have any more say

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:52,550
that a BLK pmc everyone still has one go

00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:54,860
on releases and nuclear so if there's no

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,260
additional that there are some projects

00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,620
that should use that as a spokesperson

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,080
in some cases which is you know okay you

00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,480
agreed but that's not the point the

00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,320
point really is just the university to

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,670
make sure the board gets reported it

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,140
bakes

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,470
and then if the board has a question

00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:17,770
they will ask the chair to make sure the

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:21,430
pmc answer the question so I really

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:31,530
that's that's most impressive you know

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:31,530
he'll good that people thank you

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:45,550
it kind of allows than good yes how do i
