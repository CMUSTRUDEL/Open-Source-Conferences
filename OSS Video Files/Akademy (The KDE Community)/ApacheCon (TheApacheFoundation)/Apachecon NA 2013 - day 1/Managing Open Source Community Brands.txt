saudia morning I see we have a slightly

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,200
smaller crowd than NICs famous Apache

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,660
ways to talk this is about managing

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,929
Apache project brands so this is very

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,370
specific to how we do it at Apache in

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,780
with the experience of the past 10 years

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,670
really past two or three years when

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,900
we've had enough projects that have big

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,910
enough brand that really needs thought

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,300
of how we treat the brains of our

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,189
products so I am shanker crew I'm the

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,810
vice president of brand management for

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,300
the apache software foundation so I'm a

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,430
legal officer of the corporation which

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,290
is important later on this is a

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,239
volunteer position appointed by the

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,610
board of directors although I actually

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,649
report to the president at the asf so I

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,940
don't know if Nick had a an org chart of

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,550
the asf but that's another interesting

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,550
little side thing that is a we can go

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,410
into later so my responsibility for the

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,500
past two years is to define the brand

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,329
and trademark use policy for all Apache

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,420
projects and paddling's so this is a

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,059
requirement for all projects to meet

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,710
basic brain requirements so that we can

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,329
defend the brands on behalf of the

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,979
projects which usually is not an issue

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,650
but when it does become an issue it's

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,680
very important to do it right so we have

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,510
a questions to trade marks at Apache org

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,880
this is a privately archived mailing

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,040
list that only members are allowed on to

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,659
because when we're discussing legal

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,820
issues which trademarks often get into

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,180
you can't necessarily have those in

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,619
public well we might want to any time we

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,479
ask the lawyers about it they all start

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,720
shaking and we say okay well well do

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,909
privately thank you and I personally am

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,530
NOT a lawyer I'm a came as a software

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,200
developer and then a volunteer here at

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,790
Apache so but the experience of this

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,460
position has taught me that I could play

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,130
one on the Internet so stay tuned for my

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,729
upcoming TV show and I've posted the

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,409
slides online here in Fletcher so what

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,560
are we to talk about today we'll do a

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,939
brief overview of what trademarks are so

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,280
this isn't this isn't a talk about

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,930
branding and marketing and how to get

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,600
people this is a talk about the

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,430
logistics of trademarks and we have to

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,380
understand what they are before we can

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,340
have an intelligent conversation because

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,489
the understanding varies widely

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,289
especially with engineers the bulk is

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,150
how do we manage

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,349
brands how do we deal with trademark use

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,150
and make sure we do it right well

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,400
there's really three parts that I think

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,019
are important for people here most of

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,109
whom are making on an Apache project

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,090
what PMC's need to do themselves and we

00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,650
have some education and this talk is as

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,170
part of the education that we have for

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,310
PMC's so they can understand there are

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,170
other things that you really need to do

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,269
together with trademarks that's with me

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,700
and a number of other Apache members on

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,620
our private mailing lists to say okay is

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,010
this okay did can we do this permission

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,840
can we change this and there's some

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,420
things that you have to let me and the

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,519
trademarks lists do on your behalf for

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,290
legal reasons for efficiency reasons

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,790
there are a few things we have to do for

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,840
you which which is a good thing trust me

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,239
we're talking about how apache those

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,790
things how can the other side is how can

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,530
your company who uses apache projects or

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,019
consults or trains how can you

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,000
respectfully use apache brands so we can

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,560
get value out of it but that the

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,620
project's the communities who built the

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,849
software get the credit they deserve so

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,269
that's an important part and some

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,979
resources so if we look around the room

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,290
now if you look at your fellow people

00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,239
anybody who's flinching it's probably a

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,010
lawyer because they understand that you

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,569
cannot possibly describe anything

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,290
worthwhile about trademarks in 30

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:32,879
seconds but we're trying so what are

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,220
trademarks I ended up writing which

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,109
sound very blase but are very I think

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,540
worthwhile trademarks are the legal

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,370
instantiation of your brand so we know

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,870
what instantiate an object is well

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,409
that's what the trademark is is it's the

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,319
legal bit about it it's really about

00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:51,269
preventing consumer confusion about the

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,090
source of a particular good software

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:58,680
product or box of tissues or computer or

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,530
podium to within a specific field of

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,060
commerce so tissue boxes and computers

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,650
and podiums are different field of

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,400
commerce so the sort of different worlds

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,819
for trademarks the trademark itself is

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,459
the specific name or logo the legal

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,039
detail definition really liberal that

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:22,560
somebody associates with that good so I

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:23,490
have a thinkpad branded laptop so we say

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,199
I have a thinkpad but really

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,580
a thinkpad brand laptop so the the hard

00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,590
thing that for all people to understand

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,110
is trademarks are not about protecting

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,030
us they're not necessarily directly to

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,979
help us as Apache projects or as

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,979
companies to sell our things trademarks

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,349
fundamentally are protecting consumers

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:46,259
so that when consumers buy a thinkpad

00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:48,960
product they know it comes from IBM and

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,819
not from somebody else or excuse me they

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,220
know it comes from Lenovo and not for

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,340
somebody else because they expect from

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,289
past history that IBM and now Lenovo

00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,970
makes a certain type of product with a

00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,550
certain quality with they have certain

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,500
expectations when you hire you know

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,300
services from IBM you know you can just

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,430
call up and they'll send somebody to

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,069
your office the next day that's part of

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,069
the brand of IBM so trademark protect

00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:16,289
you when you're looking for a service or

00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:18,960
product that you know you're getting it

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:21,030
from IBM and not from somebody else so

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,380
that's you really have to change how you

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,560
think when you get into the details of

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,229
trademarks it's not what we think of

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,349
things it's what a new user coming to

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,610
our project who wants to know wow I need

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,349
you know some really simple servlet

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,229
container and I've heard about tom cat

00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:38,789
they're looking for tom cat that's the

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,940
trade market associates hopefully with

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:45,810
tomcat Apache org and hopefully with the

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,330
software product they download so a

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,949
brand there are lot of elements to

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,810
branding and marketing and we other

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,880
people can talk about that it's the look

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,650
and feel the names you use that the

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,530
tagline and the phrases and so on for

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,449
the minimum purposes we have the

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,610
trademark part of your brand is really

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,830
the specific name or logo that people

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,069
associate with your software product or

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,330
service so in most Apache cases it's the

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,009
software product it's what they get when

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,300
they download something that's the

00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:17,009
primary trademark now your project name

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,080
so there's the apache tomcat project

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,630
that produces the apache tomcat software

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,759
your project name is not necessarily a

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,650
trademark we can we can say it's a

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,240
service mark because when you go to the

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,330
tomcat project you expect helpful people

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,250
to answer your questions but those

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,849
aren't necessarily in our case as strong

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,849
as the

00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:38,099
product marks we have but those details

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,289
service or product and you clearly brand

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,539
it are important when you start to talk

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,830
to trademark people we all know what

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,379
they mean but remember this is from the

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,509
point of view of a new participant in

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,919
our project or even just a new user of a

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,889
project that's what trademarks are

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,089
really about so I'll just do this

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,429
quickly because it already hates this

00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:59,369
one trademarks should be adjectives or

00:06:56,429 --> 00:07:02,909
rather legally trademarks are adjectives

00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:05,189
a trademark describes the goods that

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,319
you're providing for sale or for free

00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,419
download in our case so i buy to the

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,610
next brain tissues which strip I prefer

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,679
to myself because I expect a certain

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,990
kind of tissue we run apache Lucene

00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:18,929
software we also run apache hadoop

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,949
software Hadoop is a registered

00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:25,949
trademark of the ASM but in common usage

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,599
be able to say we run Python that's okay

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,399
that's fine you don't need to sprinkle

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,809
little teams and ours and so on

00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:36,959
everywhere but it is important to

00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:40,229
establish our use of trademarks in key

00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,649
places to use them as an adjective so we

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,930
should not say that Hadoop runs massive

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,180
big data we should say on our homepage

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,949
and the download page the two really

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,879
critical parts from a legal point of

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,860
view are Hadoop software runs big data

00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,769
and that's an important distinction that

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,490
we think is silly but trademark lawyers

00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:03,539
get antsy though so it's important let's

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,490
let's throw in other places we don't

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:10,860
need to worry about it beyond our main

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,089
public front so you can't do all these

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,339
things are trademarks what can you do a

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:17,669
trade mark well everybody else besides

00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:20,610
us can talk about our products so that's

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,249
called nominative use and it's the idea

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,409
is kind of like fair use for copyright

00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:27,779
but it's not legally the same so don't

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:29,819
don't ever say that to a lawyer people

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,419
have to be able to talk about your

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,909
product people even have to be able to

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,069
talk about your how do you build because

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,899
the latest a new build really sucks at

00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,370
performance and it's so slow here let me

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,219
show you this chart of Hadoop versus so

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,960
and so with performance that's okay they

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,940
can say that that's not infringing

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,030
trademark they're clearly talking about

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:55,230
our product which is what trademarks are

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:57,270
for so an important point is personal

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,550
blogs newspaper articles software

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,070
reviews places like that where somebody

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,500
is talking about software products those

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,880
are almost always known her to use and I

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,710
have had a number of places where

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,970
commuters or PMC's come to me and say

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,580
you know all but they said this about

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,830
like yeah but they're not they're

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,300
talking about your product they can see

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,980
we would never confuse it for their

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,760
product it's a review it's obviously

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,360
about apache hadoop so infringement

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,520
which is a serious issue is when a third

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,950
party uses your trademark in a way that

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,380
could confuse a consumer where the

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,030
consumer would get that particular

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,600
software product in our case software

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:41,010
products so recently someone else said

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,210
so and soco is Hadoop and then went on

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,660
to talk about how they have this great

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,910
Hadoop stuff with nary an Apache around

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,770
that is close to infringement because

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,080
you know i am hadoop if i start

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,480
marketing myself that way and providing

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,790
software that people say hey shane's

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,530
it's great to dupe expert no i might be

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,000
an expert about Hadoop software from

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:05,580
Apache but I'm not Hadoop can only be

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,410
gone from the new project so it's really

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,240
about how the consumer sees the

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,820
perception of getting the software

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,930
product if if you notice the subtle

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,640
product over there and they're talking

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,770
about something about the product that's

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,810
fine if they're talking about it as if

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:25,260
it's their product that's not okay so

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,790
registered trademarks this is a regal

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,790
detail we probably don't need to worry

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,500
about hopefully we won't need to worry

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,400
about it because nobody will complain

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,790
but if they do most Apache product names

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,200
and rather project or product names are

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,250
not registered registered trademarks in

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,610
various jurisdictions around the world

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,320
your active use in commerce ie we put up

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,700
a website that's publicly available and

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,860
it provides a software product for

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,560
download that shows that we're using a

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,910
certain trademark to associate with

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,710
product that accrue

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,480
common law trademark rights if you do

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,690
that for a while the course recognize

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,040
you are there first you're doing it if

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,590
you want you can register that with

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,050
various governments it's you know the EU

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,240
has won the US has won all our other

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,600
countries have their own it's kind of a

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,280
hassle they do give extra protections in

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,560
case there was a problem and somebody

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,480
contests it if you have a registered

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,060
trademark you can get extra damages in

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
court it's easier to prove it and so on

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,150
that way doesn't matter because I don't

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,560
expect that we will ever get to a point

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:36,910
where that has to matter so we'd only do

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,160
about that other than if we do have a

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,780
registered trademark then the standards

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,730
of how you present it are more important

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,030
so the Hadoop pmc needs to be careful to

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,500
use the are so that when we show yes

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,770
we're doing it properly we can protect

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,540
it so a lot of people have said but it's

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,790
open source you know so you give it all

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,520
your stuff away for free we get away

00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,250
their advice for free sure it is open

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,870
source but if you read almost every open

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,360
source license you will see an exclusion

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,910
for trademarks so you can do whatever

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,750
you want with apache software

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:13,150
essentially but you can't take a name

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,170
that's really the only mean that there's

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,490
a couple other things you know please

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,460
don't sue us and so on brewery it's just

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:23,800
you really want to run you don't call it

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:25,540
Hadoop or leucine or hubcap so that's

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,420
enough to get started thinking about how

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,010
consumers see the name and associate it

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,120
with the software product that's what

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:36,700
trademark laws about what do PMC's need

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,130
to do so we don't need to be like

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,870
coca-cola or Kleenex and have you know

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,170
blending teams to do everything but we

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,240
do need to respect some things and we in

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,060
particular need the PMC's we need each

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,580
of your pmcs to do this kind of work for

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:56,230
your project really it's be responsible

00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:00,670
so it sounds trite but I can't think of

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:02,650
a better way to put it there was talking

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,910
this morning and the keynote about you

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,800
know everybody gets so excited about the

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,920
code or gets so but excited about their

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,810
same work we need to get excited about

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,880
the brand and the image that we're

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,860
presenting to the world so it's not just

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,900
that we all know what it is but you will

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,910
attract new contributors well new

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,160
contributors come from being new users

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,960
who are interested and the users come

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,330
from knowing what your software is so

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,820
thinking about your brand and putting

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:31,120
out to new people and then do it in a

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,890
proprietary Marx is fairly easy but be

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,720
consistent have a consistent project

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,280
logo make sure this gets on all the

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,130
different pages whether it's developer

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,070
face and their end user facing

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,240
consistent across your websites

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,490
understand that how people see your

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,290
brand so even really simple things of

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,690
asking people how did you find us if

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,820
there are newcomers or looking at our

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,410
site versus another product that does

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,870
the same kind of thing you know how

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,300
would a newcomer see it those important

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,030
things to do and one thing that is

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,120
important for PMC's is treat the Apache

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:06,100
name and the Apache feather respectfully

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,320
because those belong to the asf and

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,840
represent all of our projects so

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,890
consumers have a certain expectation

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,600
when there's a patchy food when they

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,800
download it they expect there will be

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,690
community support behind it and they

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
expect that will do what it says so

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,910
that's another important brand we need

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,760
to work around work on so being

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,530
consistent so you think we're software

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,990
engineers were consistent about making

00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,940
things compile but this is about

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:35,110
consistency in the presentation on the

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,720
website so your use of your brand your

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,750
use of how the tomcat logo appears or

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,640
how the Cassandra I appears is the

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,010
reference of movement implementation so

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,360
we need to show the world this is our

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,360
great logo and this is an area of

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,250
product and our product does this then

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,370
people will understand including

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:58,120
trademark lawyers that our product is

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:00,010
this thing and that's the name Fort so

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,510
we need to tell the world you attribute

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,630
your trademarks you annotate them with

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:08,530
the TM r the r or sm for service mark if

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:11,020
its service you're providing we need is

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,900
sure we're consistent the especially on

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,620
the

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,870
page and or landing pages and the

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,120
download page because most of our

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,220
trademarks are software products so the

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,540
trademark attorney will ask show me how

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,490
the world sees you your homepage and

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,500
show me how the world actually gets your

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:33,320
product so your download page needs to

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:36,170
have apache Lucene TM software here the

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,880
rest is not as important but those front

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,660
pages are important and trailer lawyers

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,160
have asked us about that the only thing

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,840
about being consistent is there's no

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,250
magic ruler for exactly how often you

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,860
have to do it trademark law is not a

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,070
compiler what it really is is that the

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,630
end effect on the consumer which you

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,010
know we can all guess that but we never

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,980
really gets decided until you go to

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,770
court but if you if you look through

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,390
your website with fresh eyes as a

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,310
consumer you can get the effect does it

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,260
does this no is it consistent be saying

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,460
we've seen is this software product what

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,850
we call the different things so we need

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,680
to make sure we show ourselves properly

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,950
pmcs as the experts for their software

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,720
need to make sure you are aware of how

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,820
the rest of the world sees you and how

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,660
the rest of the world talks about you so

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,550
trademarks the trademarks mean you

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,350
cannot do this so catchy as an

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,240
organization can't help you because we

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,850
don't have resources and you're the

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,860
experts but you need to be aware of how

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,430
other people use your product and talk

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,050
about your product so the important one

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,470
important thing that we need to address

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:49,910
we have to address legally is are there

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:53,060
third-party uses of Cassandra that might

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,730
confuse a consumer about the true source

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,830
of Cassandra software so if you read an

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,540
article and take a fresh mind and you

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,530
say wow i'd love to get Cassandra

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,470
software from joe's company wow that's a

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,060
problem those are things we need to

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,280
address because if you legally if you

00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,400
don't address those issues you can lose

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,240
your trademarks but really those are

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,410
very small percentage of the uses uses

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,150
notwithstanding the many people who said

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,580
oh really did you know go fix this

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,030
reference in a newspaper article like no

00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,290
it's a newspaper article

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,460
Cassandra software and so and says

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,460
software and which one does a better job

00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:33,910
of though matching personal again

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:37,120
partial blogs new super sites reviews

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,550
benchmarks reports most email on all of

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,650
our developer lists their nominative use

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,480
they're not going to confuse a consumer

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,760
where to get the software it might

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,990
confuse you about is it good software or

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,440
does it have bugs but that's not

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:55,590
important for tree marks one thing that

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:58,300
is critical is being fair so we cannot

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,100
give extra leeway to companies that are

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,560
favorable to us that provide lots of

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,880
support we have to be fair to all users

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,560
but that being said you're the most

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,360
experienced at knowing how people are

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,880
talking about your product so you're

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,950
know who's talking about it and the uses

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
there might be funny but given that most

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,900
of these is that you might complain it

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,950
out probably aren't infringement so that

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,550
would be where you would work with

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,140
pretty marks so we need to understand

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,120
how people are talking about us but we

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,730
need to make sure we're fair when we

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,370
talk about other people so when we talk

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,650
about microsoft windows operating system

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,270
you can say you let it or you can say it

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,890
sucks it doesn't matter but we'd be

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,340
respectful that it's microsoft's

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,170
trademark there's no place for a

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,230
charitable organization to infringe on

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,300
anyone else's trademark so new pod

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,550
things coming to the incubator have a

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,190
name search process so we need to make

00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,390
sure that when we accept a new name that

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,040
we're not going to have an Apache

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,750
project name that is going to confuse

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,490
somebody else's product that's that's

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:06,340
not never fair so we should be exemplars

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,780
of giving credit to all the other

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,610
software that we use all the companies

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,050
who have donated to us all the whatever

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,880
that's what we shouldn't be thinking of

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:20,320
competing with anybody else which would

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,400
be happy to give credit so this is a

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,460
little bit different from brand

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,250
management but this is a critical part

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,780
of how Apache works as Jim said this

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,650
morning there's no you can't buy

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,720
membership in the asf membership is by

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:39,559
merit elected members individuals

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,240
PMC's need to act the same way there's

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,250
an article on this which I urge everyone

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,289
to read you need to present an

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,539
independent face to your project so that

00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:50,059
affects the branding you need to show a

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,549
newcomer that you are Apache Cassandra

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,520
and you're doing crew stuff for daily

00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:57,110
basis and you're not working with this

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,090
company or working with that company or

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,320
doing something exclusive or you're not

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,600
you know hoping that somebody will go

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,320
buy this product you need to divide a an

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,049
independent software product that is

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,820
useful on its own you can't just provide

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,750
a framework that requires plugins to

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,630
work that of course come from this

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,600
company that's not that's not providing

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,360
the public good so both showing that

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,640
your project is governed independently

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,010
of commercial influence and providing an

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,710
independently useful product are

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,710
critical parts of how Apache works this

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:34,130
is not as important from the branding

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:36,140
aspect but but how we show the

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,909
contributors to our project perhaps is a

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,200
way they can show that we should show

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:44,450
that there are individuals contributing

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,950
not companies so I've you know said okay

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,630
how you need to help do all this stuff

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,220
for banishment and you're saying you

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,990
know geez I didn't expect to have to

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,740
have all this extra work well what can

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:57,169
trademarks do together with PMC's so

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:02,120
when there are issues then trademarks is

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:05,929
here to help so we do need to police

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,580
brand use so I get lots of reports i

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,740
have 0 so and so is is misusing your

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,419
brand what should we do or oh my god

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,100
they're doing this you have to stop them

00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:16,630
right away well that doesn't actually

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,760
help but yes I would look at it trust me

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,140
we need to work together and again we

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,730
have some guidelines which I've not

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,970
publicized well enough but I'm going to

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,250
work on that for all PMC's always work

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,140
with trademarks before contacting an

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,210
outside party if you think they are

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,380
infringing about something because about

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,270
half the time i'm going to say they're

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,159
not actually infringing and we don't do

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,080
anything you could put a comment in

00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,340
their blog and say hey you know I saw

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,230
you talking about this and bad

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,490
performance but I have other stats you

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:48,020
can respond that way but it's not a

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,840
trademark issue the few PMC's who know

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,950
how to do this

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,350
if you already know how to do this then

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,970
you know that but otherwise work with

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,330
trademarks before contacting anyone

00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,299
outside Apache we always contact people

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,010
privately some people want to go post

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,990
and some people have personal blog

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,580
saying you know so-and-so is bad company

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,630
because they're stealing our name bad

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:13,020
idea assuming ignorance rather than

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,640
mouse yeah it usually is that whether

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,570
it's ignorance by a marketing person or

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:23,010
just ignorance and general if we do it

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,630
in private everybody can say face that's

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,850
really important a lot of cases where

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,250
perhaps some you know corporate team

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,600
might want to edge in and after we

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,970
explained to them privately ethically

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,870
explain to the right person that no

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,730
that's not going to work with this

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,460
community that's not how we work they

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,720
change the rice and they get it but if

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,350
you have that conversation in public

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,960
that can blow up that can cause flames

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:49,049
and just having that the public can

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,169
damage their reputation there actually

00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,549
are legal issues if you call someone out

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:57,870
explicitly about a trademark and you're

00:22:53,549 --> 00:23:01,049
wrong you actually can be sued so doing

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:04,049
private to start with be professional

00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:08,960
and polite so you don't need to wear tie

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:12,899
fact I notice that nobody is that's good

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,360
but we're often going to be really we're

00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:16,950
contacting at some company it's often

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,110
going to get bumped up to somebody who

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,490
does perhaps at least in the divot world

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:25,830
where tie so we need to be professional

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,690
we need to be polite we need to make

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,360
sure that they understand we know we're

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,789
talking about this indeed is our valid

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:38,370
trademark we own it we can show you how

00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:39,750
and that we need to be specific because

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,510
you can't just say I don't like how

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,460
you're talking about Cassandra that that

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,669
doesn't help them what you need to say

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,289
is this use of Cassandra on your giant

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:51,299
banner that is now on your web page

00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,610
that's right next to your software

00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,669
company logo the duck doesn't talk about

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,320
apache that could confuse consumers

00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,270
somebody who doesn't know that much but

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,130
knows they want because

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,920
under awesome that's all they'll get

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,360
that company for Cassandra so you need

00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,370
to point out the specific issues and

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,610
usually pointing out a couple a couple

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,860
of the specific details that trademarks

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,170
legally could be used to enforce will

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,880
help get the conversation of we'd like

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:22,460
if you were you know better presented us

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,350
the great majority of infringing cases

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,270
or potentially infringing cases let me

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,630
be clear are resolved by discussion

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:33,230
privately and legal threats are never

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,060
the first step so I actually have had a

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,700
couple of times people sending me an

00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:43,160
email saying oh okay well to assemble

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:45,590
the CMD letter now no so speaking of

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,450
legal issues we need to coordinate legal

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:52,280
advice if there is a legal question I

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,450
didn't see anybody flinching earlier so

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,870
I don't think we have any lawyers here

00:24:53,450 --> 00:25:00,500
which means nobody here can give legal

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,720
advice don't do it we have pro bono

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,550
corporate representation for Apache

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,950
officially signed with waivers and so on

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,230
both the software freedom law council

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,690
provides general support and dla piper

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,840
which is a major international IP law

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,810
firm both provide lawyers for us so when

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,460
we need it we can ask them questions if

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:22,730
you do get legal questions or if you do

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,950
get questions from some VP or CEO that

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,460
sounds a little bit you know out of the

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,010
average technical realm then get help

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,620
trying to answer them trademarks is a

00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:37,360
private list for anything about plans or

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:39,710
trademarks legal dash internal is a

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,470
privately archive list where the Legal

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,630
Affairs Committee reads so if a project

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,040
has a legal question like you need to

00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,080
incorporate a new piece of code with a

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,880
different license you have reason to do

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,240
that you need that to say is this okay

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,730
go to legal internal we also have a

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,660
publicly archived list called legal

00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:02,060
discuss that is for general discussions

00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,050
about legal ideas you can ask your

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,240
questions there you might not get an

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,750
answer because lawyers are reticent to

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,620
give answers for hypothetical questions

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,270
so

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:17,410
never give advice and never give

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:19,180
explicit permissions or exemptions for

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,400
trademark use without talking to

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,750
trademarks so some people say oh sure

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,030
you can use that logo on your t-shirt

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,050
for the next event well yet did you

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,550
really think about the trademark

00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,600
implications because maybe they're

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,650
actually going to be selling that

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,150
t-shirt or maybe they're gonna be using

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:35,650
it for the next two years so you can't

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,530
projects are not empowered to give away

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,450
trademark rights only in this case I or

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,500
the president are so we're happy to work

00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,770
with you if that makes sense for your

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,850
project sure that's fine but we need to

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:52,150
work with PMC's to judge that fairly so

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:55,390
what should you not try doing and what

00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:59,350
will i do or other officers of the asf

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:02,140
do for you so first the reason we're out

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:05,680
of this is we set policy for all Apache

00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,600
projects this is not the core trave our

00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,940
policy is not optional this is a

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,530
requirement for projects and if fabrics

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,480
don't answer to me that I'm confident

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,100
that the only answer to Jim who's here

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,660
in the room all the rents of the board

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,360
was more than happy to talk to them but

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,430
beyond the minimums of respecting the

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,260
details of trademarks how you do you

00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:30,340
then that's up to you that just like

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:32,560
code is strictly for pmc strong what

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,390
your brand is how you promote it that's

00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,580
up to you i do not want happening

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,190
anything for that but i am happy to help

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,140
much like press at apache oil in phrase

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,810
here if you need other servers or if you

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,140
want to do a press release the asf is

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,490
here to serve the projects and the the

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,680
brand guidelines are just a better way

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,050
that we're doing that because many of

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:57,060
our projects are quite important brands

00:27:53,050 --> 00:28:00,730
in the world so this is the primary

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:03,040
workflow unfortunately for trademarks is

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,750
when we send someone to private note

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,670
saying hey you know you're not really do

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,580
is right we suggest you use separate the

00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:11,800
logos or put Apache over it whatever

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:15,820
when they say no or when they have a

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,310
lower right back to us then play work

00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:21,520
should be the one writing back so as

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:25,860
much as Apache we're in all

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,690
world of high-performing individuals

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,400
collaborating openly when we step out of

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,560
that world to deal with some company who

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,630
perhaps is new to Apache they look at

00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,270
individual names and titles in

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,380
particular very differently so nobody

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,790
actually really cares it on a vice

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,680
president and you know other with

00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,660
activity really good guy president

00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,770
really is not exciting other than he

00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,780
gets to do a lot of extra pay for work

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,020
but when you go out to corporate

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,250
companies they pay attention if you are

00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,740
you know so-and-so committed from this

00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,900
and I'm upset about this when it gets

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,880
bumped up to a lawyer or vice president

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,110
marketing that I said yeah whatever when

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,880
I like them a letter and I sign it with

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,460
my title and I point to the policy that

00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,760
has my name on it well on the apache

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,380
site they said oh okay I actually need

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,310
to pay attention to this it's sad but

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:20,470
true most important thing on this slide

00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:22,990
is patience so as I said earlier private

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,490
discussions that I don't want to call

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,780
the negotiations because we're not going

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,840
to get away trademark rights just

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,400
because but there are discussions and we

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,170
explain better ways to do things and we

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,830
explain knowit's but this takes some

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,240
time it Bo stakes time for me or other

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,520
members who are volunteers and list to

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,080
craft replies and it takes time for

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,300
corporations to work through perhaps

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,470
their chain of command so that's one of

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,510
the hardest things I have explaining to

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,950
projects is yes we are dealing with this

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,880
thing I know you would the website every

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,440
day and it looks horrible because

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,110
they're saying whatever about your

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,640
project your baby but we'd have patience

00:29:53,110 --> 00:30:01,780
and through this legal threats are never

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,270
the second step so at this point I'm you

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,110
know and I hate this guy I'm not

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,450
controversy pushed in I don't like

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,390
conflict but I'm writing back people

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,400
saying no I'm sorry that's not okay we

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,900
need to work through this I'm not

00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,860
thinking about legal threats I'm just

00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:20,980
talking to them well what if we do have

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,930
to have legal threats well as see

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,180
similar sis desist letter which is a

00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,630
legal form of the sort of first shot

00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:31,270
across the balance is not the next step

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,320
it's not a good idea even though you

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,889
might be offended or in

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,960
be a true infringement on our product

00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:41,750
name in a specific area think of the

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,610
public image of a non-profit attacking

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,500
someone else for the name so we need to

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,309
be careful about the public image of any

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:52,220
legal or other you know actions we might

00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:54,580
take because we need be careful always

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,139
to keep you know sort of the public

00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,830
thought of upper hand of a you know a

00:30:57,139 --> 00:31:03,529
do-good charity trademark litigation is

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,700
expensive and risky there are couple of

00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,559
lawyers or talk about 0f said you know

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,029
you know if this ever happened what

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,490
would we do and they just blocked me

00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:15,950
they said you don't like okay most

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:19,009
issues can be resolved with discussion

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,750
so that may require having Jim talk to

00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:22,549
them it may require finding the right

00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,379
person of their company they require

00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:27,169
setting for meeting with the CEO and

00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:28,659
with a SF counsel and when the lawyers

00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:31,039
on the phone then people usually think

00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:35,509
about their words a little bit

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:38,269
differently a few very serious issues if

00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:41,419
if these kind of things do not resolve

00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:45,350
it to our satisfaction a two hour at

00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:47,600
least trademark legal satisfaction then

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:51,830
we have other organizational ways to

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,419
deal with this so the asf is an

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,830
organization we have an org chart even

00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:57,049
though it's really slide it's PMC's

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,870
report to the board right well that

00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:02,179
means if we need to the board can make

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:07,190
changes within PMC's and in fact in the

00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:08,659
past the board has done so so if needed

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,820
we can make up of the case so there are

00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:12,379
cases where sometimes the public case is

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,350
the right thing to do we're very

00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:17,120
carefully no hey so-and-so is pushing

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,159
back on our brand they aren't really

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,129
contributors it's really our project

00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,779
here's why and I can't think of any

00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:26,539
companies that if we put that out as an

00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:29,059
official statement of the asf basically

00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:32,930
calling them out that they wouldn't at

00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:35,210
least notice so

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,190
so speaking Lebanese how can your

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:40,610
company's respect open switch brands or

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:42,770
in particular Apache brands because the

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,230
Apache band not just do projects but the

00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,930
Apache band is an important brand it's

00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,300
very important the SF and it is clear

00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,490
from the number of new projects in the

00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,370
incubator that it is an important one

00:32:52,490 --> 00:33:01,010
both for users and for technical people

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:02,330
we want to contribute so I always want

00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,770
to make slides that are really really

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,750
simple and then I end up buying all

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,990
sorts of other details but really it's

00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,790
the community's brand not yours so if

00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,730
you are a company that uses our software

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:17,480
contributes to our software services

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:19,640
training or whatever it's our brand it's

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,320
our trademark it is not yours and you

00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,460
should treat it as such imagine that we

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,680
are Microsoft when you do want to use a

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,110
brand aware you do want a sponsor a

00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,240
conference where ever asked first we're

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,240
happy to work with you the key point is

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,640
give us plenty of lead time we're all

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,280
volunteers here and there are very few

00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,020
of us who are volunteers in very marks

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,270
so make sure you give us plenty of time

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,880
to review it before your marketing

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,590
question wants to go out speaking of

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,210
marketing people ensure that your

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,970
marketing department understands your

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,340
company's strategic goals I cannot count

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,780
on my fingers and toes the number of

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,040
times we have had an issue of the

00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,140
company that has been so modely serious

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,210
and let it all comes down once the right

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,040
people have been talked to that yes the

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,420
company gets the CEO gets that the

00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,980
engineers get it I mean there's some

00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,170
awesome energy is react how can I help

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:16,100
Apache and their marketing department

00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:18,740
has gone off rogue and after its

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:22,670
explained to them by the CEO it's all

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:25,430
fine but market departments can do that

00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:28,400
sometimes apparently so and we only

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,980
notice the asf Apache is here for all of

00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,310
its public communities so don't think

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,960
that just because it's some small Apache

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:41,030
project that it's not going to get love

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:43,130
it will so you need to create your own

00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,210
brand I mean if you're a company you

00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,970
should have your own

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,669
Marketing thought and so on so quickly

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:52,599
burn because this is our thing this is

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:56,960
the community's brand it's not yours so

00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,040
talking about ways to you want to get

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,650
some benefit because you're building

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,800
something on top of Hadoop so big co

00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,420
super thing powered by Apache Hadoop

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,460
that's probably okay it clearly

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,920
separates the two things it says Apache

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,680
Hadoop which is a big indicator to most

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,089
people the consumer patchy that were

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,950
happy to do because there are so many of

00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:18,770
our products there are surveys things

00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,470
that get added onto but all the other

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,510
ideas anything that takes Hadoop or

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,790
Apache through the food and puts it

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,820
Mexico name no those are clearly

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:31,760
infringing and we will not tolerate them

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,910
so selling pmcs have extra logos like a

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,220
powered by logo there's the powered by

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,830
httpd logo which is ancient but out

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,750
there a lot if you can see is going to

00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,780
do that that's great and will help them

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,099
but if the PMC doesn't provide that then

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,290
assume that you need to treat it as a

00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:51,380
completely separate print if your

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:55,150
corporation so a great thing is give

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:57,650
credit to the community so hopefully

00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:00,440
people running these corporations are

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:02,030
thinking they're competing with the rest

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,190
of the corporate world they're not

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,359
competing with the Apache project if you

00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,410
think you're competing the Apache

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,480
project then I'm sorry I can help you

00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:15,020
but being liberal with praise and

00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,990
attribution and giving credit to Apache

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,760
food project your bill discreet stuff

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,010
and then rebuilt amazing stuff on top of

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,589
it that should be an easy thing for

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:27,859
corporations to do and it's a great way

00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:29,540
to some the Apaches point of view if you

00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:32,570
are marking your thing part of your

00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:35,060
marketing includes of impact ours that

00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,500
brings potential users to us but more

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,960
importantly potential contributors to

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,890
our projects so that's critical for our

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,390
projects and that's something that

00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,890
should be easy for corporations to do

00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:48,080
while they're also trumpeting their own

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:49,970
horn of course because most important

00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,470
asset to our communities are our

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,270
contributors so we want to make sure

00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,770
that the the people who build our

00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,410
projects get the credit so that's part

00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,040
of what branding at Apache should be

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,020
about is

00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,760
sure our communities get credit and

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,250
whatever you are do with it that's fine

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,300
but know that the first thing of leucine

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:11,600
was built by these people here so thank

00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,940
you and resources and questions so I was

00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,440
like to end with the thank you obviously

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,900
basically thank you to everybody room

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,760
and ivory at the conference for

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,770
contributing to Apache both code and

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,150
documentation especially documentation

00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:29,510
and organization and whatever it is

00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:33,920
thanks to our pro bono counsel sflc and

00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:42,140
di Piper and thank you for coming and

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:43,940
listening to my talk so I can answer any

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,830
questions if you do have questions by

00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,810
email please send them to the trademarks

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,950
list so that every lesson that list can

00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:53,860
see it and we can get back to you an

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,860
appropriate way so we have one back

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,569
public lashing projects doesn't believe

00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:04,730
thank you for doing the stocks been very

00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:06,470
enlightening could I've always felt that

00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,980
there's there's lockable mystery to

00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,980
trademarks

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:18,790
website wanted to specifically sausage

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:21,339
no comments on why there is this

00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:24,170
specific

00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:28,380
departure from from unity but applies to

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:31,750
most projects when it comes

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,340
okay so the question is why why why are

00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,840
incubating projects treated differently

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:39,640
Berman wise then top of the projects

00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,470
because in the Quran sir is because

00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,180
they're not a factory projects yet so

00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,760
while they all make it betta we provide

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,430
them a home the asf does not stand

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,090
behind them as an example of what we

00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:53,760
expect projects to be so that's the fund

00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,690
mental reason the realistic reason is

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,010
they've just come into the incubator

00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:59,410
they already have their own way of doing

00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,960
things and we understand that you know

00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:04,870
you need time to change so from the

00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,150
branding perspective at the minimum I'm

00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,620
happy for them to do whatever they want

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,870
as long as they include incubating

00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,220
because we for the Apache land that's

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,830
important to understand this is not

00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:18,460
necessarily Patrick Patrick yet then you

00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:20,740
want as long as the full graduation that

00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,320
they comply with the Apache blending

00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,820
policies and any trademarks with that

00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:30,880
project are being donated to the asf so

00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,890
topical projects the asf must have the

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,110
trademark rights to the name and logo or

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,120
whatever which usually is simply the

00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,800
company or individuals rebuilding of it

00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,570
they want to come here so it's very

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,610
clear but for example there's a

00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,370
registered trademark we have to have the

00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:49,240
registration we you know the SF hold

00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:50,830
trademarks on behalf of all projects but

00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,590
you're like that there isn't enough

00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,930
documentation and solve it is you can't

00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,970
understand the rationale for some of the

00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:01,240
documentation without a few bits of

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:04,840
trademark background so any other color

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,760
del note is there are parts of how we

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,840
implement trademark policy that are not

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,040
on the public web pages because there

00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,860
are some companies who think of this as

00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,890
a competition and we'll try to find ways

00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:23,080
around the policy to maximize their gain

00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:26,140
at everyone else's detriment so that's

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,520
not a wild thought actually I've had

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,350
someone specifically come to me saying

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,090
can I see your documentation because I'm

00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:34,870
going to find a way around it that's

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,460
rare that that's not common but that's

00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:39,960
that's also part of why we do all

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,760
enforcement privately so if you also me

00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,980
what's the risk that's going to happen

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,510
if such and such company tries to use of

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,060
our brand and I am NOT going to discuss

00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,730
what we will do because those are legal

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:55,070
issues and we don't discuss those in

00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,070
public so is that a question over here

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:06,450
yeah god Zach cos staff does a great job

00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:11,070
of trademarks so we have a lot of people

00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:14,160
that are doing events now yes when they

00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:19,950
want to do the events after the costly

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:22,830
señor in our ppm c or some day we want

00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:27,480
them to get permission for their events

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:30,240
and cream works or just for the time

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,660
being desk aankhon we we we can discuss

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,220
that later with Rick but events are very

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,080
specific it sit there are different ways

00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,280
you think of silly branding an event

00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,830
whether it's on the slides or whatever

00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,960
then other uses so content was the right

00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:47,820
place for that so the question was about

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,890
if if projects have somebody who wants

00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,599
to run events about their project and

00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,580
you know cover you else to use logo then

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,410
ask con-com for permissions and we

00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,480
actually have a detailed if you make a

00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:01,880
run an event here the things you must do

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:08,490
once you do them come and ask us so okay

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:10,170
thank you yeah I'll be here all week

00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:13,640
I'll be wearing a Hawaiian shirt that's

00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,640
