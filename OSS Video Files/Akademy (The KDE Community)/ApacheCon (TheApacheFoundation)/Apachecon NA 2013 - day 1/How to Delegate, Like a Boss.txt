it's great to be here I save you a lot

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,460
of work and free open source software

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,410
communities around the community

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,900
organizing part I came to this this

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,369
place not from a computer science

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,189
background but from a political

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,199
organizing background so when I first

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,939
got here is like what do you mean we

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,160
don't take notes at meetings or all

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,869
these other things that to my political

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,849
organizing background Lauren atomo it's

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,140
like how do we get anything done what

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,540
how do you make sure we don't have the

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,730
scene tedious awful meeting every week

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,350
then I found out actually we just have

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,129
the same tedious awful meeting every

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,300
week sometimes and then you know I

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,730
feeling my way around I found not

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,370
everyone was beyond redemption and so I

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,590
started giving talks on how we could

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,320
enforce some of the things that I know

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,410
from the political organizing community

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,230
into free software communities hopefully

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,079
to their benefit so um some of these

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,329
things I obviously listen to James

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,830
talked earlier it sounds like a lot of

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,390
these things you may already be doing

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,939
well you may be doing them some of the

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,950
time so this is more to kind of give you

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,580
a framework of like best practices for

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,049
all the time and you know so if I've

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,270
gone over stuff and you're like like

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,090
totally already do that I believe you

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,630
it's fine you may not do all of the

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,939
things all of the time yet so so before

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,960
I go any further I want to talk about

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,759
like what kind of a boss like in a

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,060
community's volunteers obviously like

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,659
bass is a little bit you might not call

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,880
yourself boss ever really bet if you've

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,210
been here for a while then you end up

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,380
being a facilitator maybe or a leader or

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,270
a mentor so um so first others i'm not

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,950
talking about this kind of a boss like

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,560
someone who plays everything close to

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,560
the chest strictly need-to-know might be

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,740
dangerous for you so not that kind of a

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,320
boss and not like as much as I like

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,770
watching was lemon on TV she's a little

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,500
bit of

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,479
panicky micromanager and she forgets to

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,610
tell people like I asked you to do that

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,200
thing I didn't tell you it was really

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,660
important and that the show wouldn't

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,190
happen I just asked you to do that thing

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,950
so I didn't really tie it into anything

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,680
so that's also not a great model for a

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,709
boss great for comedy not great for a

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,660
project lead for folks who have not

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,330
watched fringe I think Ingram Broyles is

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,269
a good boss he gets out of the way he

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,269
lets people make mistakes all the things

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,549
that I think as project leads and

00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,170
mentors we want to be doing so if you if

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,569
you ever find yourself like what should

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,340
i do maybe you want to ask yourself I my

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,890
name is limiting this or are my agent

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,390
Broyles in this so that might help you

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:54,989
as you think about things so delegation

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,459
is not magic it is it is great when you

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,239
do it better and it does help you a lot

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,310
with efficiency but it definitely is

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,269
also some work so it's not like

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,129
abracadabra and PS i love the internet i

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,480
just search for magic carpet and i got a

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,950
cat on a carpet which is great but so

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,250
some of the things that we think about

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,530
in projects as far as being efficient

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,840
like reusing code when you're delegating

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,209
or your mentoring if you can build

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,060
resources that you can reuse that's

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,579
going to help you be more efficient so

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,530
instead of like if you think of like

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,230
four conference management if you say

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,099
like well in 2013 we're in Portland

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,500
which has great public transportation

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,510
and everything went across the street to

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,280
the sky box it was around the corner the

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,470
person who is helping to organize next

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,239
year's event wherever that is is going

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,980
to have to start all over again so you

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,319
might put something more general that

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,019
says find a place that people can get

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,400
coffee recommended whatever it is just

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,380
you know make it a reusable resource

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,329
even better you'll be helping the person

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,760
who comes after you to delegate this

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,950
task to delegate so you might end up

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,690
being the meta delegator which is a

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,430
great place to be because that means we

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,239
have more people involved more people

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,580
doing things and I cannot emphasize this

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,850
enough don't wait until you're

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,820
to burn out to start delegating I do a

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,490
lot of work with well I don't call them

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,350
out specifically but the some of the

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,090
older projects that have worked with and

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,190
they're like so there's two of us it's

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,480
been two of us for like eight years I

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:36,960
hate it I never go on vacation how do i

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,180
delegate I'm like you really wait it

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,410
like you kind of waited seven years too

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,450
long at least maybe seven and a half so

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:50,090
so don't wait so where are the things

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,380
when you're thinking about volunteers

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,210
you want to know what motivates

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,880
volunteers people ask me sometimes

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,800
they're like so when people leave the

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,960
project do you know why that is they

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,210
were asking me like do I know why people

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,830
left their project and I say well when

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,470
you did an exit interview what did they

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,820
say and they're like a what so you know

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,560
even this is more general and we'll get

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,410
into more techniques for finding out

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,690
specifically but we tend to do a really

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,720
good job of this one self-actualization

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,050
and that's kind of the satisfaction that

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,540
you get from like accomplishment making

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,230
stuff solving new problems learning new

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,669
things but sometimes we do get stuck

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,770
where someone's been doing the same

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,140
thing for a while and we forget to check

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,060
in as a community like is this still new

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,980
for you is this stuff fun for you like

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,200
are you still getting something out of

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,750
this or do you feel like we hung this

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,730
title and an albatross around your neck

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,390
and now you have to do it forever so

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:55,410
don't find people stop you know being

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:58,590
fulfilled in that way the esteem and

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,620
this is when you're feeling respected by

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,900
your peers and I'm sure everyone has

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,700
like a general sense of like yes I want

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,120
everyone on my project to know that I

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,210
like them and appreciate them but

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,800
thinking people is the best free awesome

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,570
for your project that you can infuse

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,169
it's like having a license to print

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,800
money or bitcoins or something but thank

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:25,069
yous are like free money

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,560
and then the kind of thank you that you

00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:30,590
do like so one of the things i do

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,750
besides this is I play in a band and and

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,590
we're really loud so I have friends who

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,120
come and they're like oh great set after

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,030
the show and what they're saying to me

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,460
is I don't hate you I want you to know

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,530
that I watched that thing you did so I

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,759
said great set so when you think your

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,580
contributors and you're like great job

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,310
it couldn't move verbose something like

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,159
that is a really creative solution to a

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,550
hard problem I am so glad that you took

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:03,650
that on or wow you really got that whole

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,419
mess cleaned up I can't even imagine how

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,789
long it took you but I really appreciate

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,819
it it's so much better than great job

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,830
the only thing that is also free to add

00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,569
like another like really thoroughly

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,370
thanks someone is if you thank them in

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,650
front of someone else or on the mailing

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,289
list or on the website so if you

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,599
introduce like one of your mentees as

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:27,169
like this is says she's doing some stuff

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,779
for us or this is she just triaged all

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:32,120
these bugs it's amazing like Phil is now

00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:35,090
like we're a little glow unified like

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,469
super appreciated so it would have the

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:42,319
opportunity to do that take it so sure

00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:44,569
this is you know like obviously of great

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,659
in-person events oh did you have a

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,659
question

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:09,540
you look at their code and yeah more

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,250
detail is always great fantastic thanks

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,170
so as we kind of go down the stack some

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,570
of this stuff like I said social

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,360
whenever you can facilitate connections

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,560
like if you know that your projects like

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,140
maybe it's small and there's eight of

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,670
you and you happen to know like the two

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,170
people from your project are both going

00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,390
to be at the same conference but they

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:31,030
haven't met yet you might try suggesting

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,669
that they meet up like oh you know

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,860
George and Mary you guys are both going

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,930
to be at PyCon you guys are trying it a

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,970
coffee or something so that you can meet

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,860
in person and then just helps people

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,660
feel more invested in the project and

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,910
you know it brings the temperature down

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,700
on IRC if you have that kind of a

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,060
problem ever no one has that problem

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,280
right IRC is a lovely place okay and

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,260
then as you even like safety and

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,510
physiological this tends to be less

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,150
important unless you're doing in person

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,110
so this is like physical safety

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,090
obviously if you have someone on your

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,490
IRC channel that thinks death threats

00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,730
are funny you're eventually only going

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,520
to have that guy in your IRC channel so

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,880
and you which is like why would you

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,300
punish yourself in that way so you know

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,320
keep an eye on stuff like that and then

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,090
physiological like this is some of the

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,820
things that happen at events like making

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,160
sure you have vegan options and handicap

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,050
ramps and that it's not like everyone

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,630
must have a call and drive to the venue

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,770
that type of stuff so there's pointing

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,840
on the internet on how to run a

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,700
conference that's good and this seems to

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,900
be working very well so I won't dwell

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,790
not too much so burn in the community

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,430
where questions are welcome we've

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:49,840
planned for delegation questions welcome

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,640
one of the things that works great is

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,130
that as soon when you have new people

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,380
trying to encourage them to start asked

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,750
like answering questions as soon as

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,270
possible it makes them feel part of the

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,580
community it also helps diffuse the

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,889
burden so if you're like five years in

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,049
on

00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:08,119
a project your person who's like six

00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:09,709
months in can definitely or almost

00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:12,709
always answer questions from someone

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:15,160
who's like a week in and so like you

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,959
don't have to answer those 101 questions

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,329
the other thing about 101 questions like

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:23,559
if you are like oh this I have to answer

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:27,169
that all the time and like such a dream

00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:29,600
the more our kind of resources that you

00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:32,540
can point people to to help them help

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,579
themselves the less of a dream it's

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,829
going to be on you the more empowered

00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:39,230
that person is going to be some of those

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:41,600
resources are internal like your wiki

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,329
your mailing lists and your eyes your

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,189
IRC channels but similar external I

00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:48,679
happen to be on the board at open hatch

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:51,290
so we have training missions that are

00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,559
specifically designed to help people get

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,299
up to speed on collaborative development

00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,279
models and things like that so like

00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,259
there's a get training mission a lot of

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,819
times people come out of school like

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,169
they've learned like three programming

00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,999
languages but they've never worked

00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:07,249
collaboratively and they don't want

00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,839
their first message on IRC or on the

00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,329
mailing list to be like I don't

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,100
understand how to use get so you can

00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:14,689
come in the bat channel say like here's

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,669
this little training mission it's going

00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,230
to teach you how to use get then you can

00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,790
come back and you'll be good and you'll

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,489
be at the place where you can start on

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,860
things that you know how to do open

00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:26,929
advice stack overflows you probably know

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,279
of the things already that are specific

00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:33,410
to your project so as mentioned as much

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,449
as possible like keeping an idea of what

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,129
those resources are and be documenting

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:42,470
them on your wiki so that people can

00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:44,480
help themselves last on this doing what

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,789
you can to prevent turf problems and

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,829
having like a clear chain of command or

00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:51,019
maybe not come in but like who's in

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:54,799
charge of what parts or who's working on

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:57,499
what things one of the things you make

00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,749
one consider here is an automatic drop

00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:02,119
of licked cookies do you guys know what

00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:06,169
i mean by cookie looking I've seen

00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:08,689
blanks so of saline oh noes alleged

00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:10,039
cookie is when someone says like you

00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:12,199
know something comes up and they're like

00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,020
oh yeah I'll look into that by which

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,060
they mean

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,260
I have some big passing interest and I

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,850
will never write a line of code on that

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,710
they don't know that's what they're

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,990
saying I don't want to call them out but

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,480
that's the day of thinking like well you

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,360
know maybe my 15 hours a week in my

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,690
spare time could be 16 it usually isn't

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,000
the case so there's a great project that

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,690
does an automatic drop of that type of

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,780
thing a librivox which is actually its

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,520
people reading older older public domain

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,400
works and then putting them under a

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,260
Creative Commons license so people who

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,570
have hearing impairments I'm sorry but

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,150
visual impairments can hear the these

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,070
things being read so they have a really

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,010
nice thing they're like you can sign up

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:58,680
to read chapter sign up it's yours for

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,540
two months and then life happens that's

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,670
totally fine if you haven't touched it

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,100
in two months it automatically goes back

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,010
in the pool so for some projects that

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,870
have more you know doable than others

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:14,040
depending on the way that you splice up

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:18,450
your work so so documentation this is

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:22,320
not based on scientific data so this is

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,880
this is this all anecdotal so you start

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,640
on a new task for yourself you go from

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,560
how does this work touareg wow I am

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,330
awesome at this right so this is great

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,830
where do you think the best time to

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:36,630
document is anyone anywhere along the

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:40,050
line you go ahead and say stop when you

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,170
think I've got there yep oh good you

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:46,950
guys are great so cuz this is what

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,990
happens like yeah learning why can't we

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:53,670
automate this this is the wrong time to

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:56,970
document so total ugh so there's my last

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,650
super awesome graph so yeah this is the

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,990
best time to document your like I'm

00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:04,680
looking at it with a beginner's eyes and

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,020
I am like saying all the things and then

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,850
like oh yeah I'm getting pretty good at

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,640
this but I don't really remember how it

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,070
felt to not know what step one was so

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,350
you don't put step one in if you do end

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,090
up having a document here has someone

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,740
else look at what you did and make sure

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,740
that they can replicate your steps

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,490
because everyone misses step one when I

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,680
started

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,510
free software like I got like I was like

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,700
oh I'll take a look at the Emacs manual

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,490
in the morning it seems that chapter one

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,050
is missing they're like whatever knows

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,800
how to do that stuff and I'm like no I'm

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:41,540
telling you chapter one is missing so

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,220
this again worst time to document so

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:49,230
good i hope rua well on the stand there

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,870
so setting great expectations I don't

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,790
mean overselling it if really it is

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:59,610
going to be sleeping outside than tell

00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:03,230
people so great expectations mean like

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:06,029
very realistic and thorough expectations

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,959
so there's a couple of different right

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:11,880
kind of points on there do your best to

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,209
be realistic about the time that will be

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:19,230
involved if you can will give people a

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:21,180
sense of like okay this is doable one of

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,310
the things that I've noticed with new

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,550
contributors is that they're like I took

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:30,060
me five hours to write like 20 lines of

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,890
code I'm like well yeah sometimes it

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,990
takes a really long time especially if

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,970
you're working on something that has a

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,430
lot of moving parts and interacts with a

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,209
lot of other things and this code base

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:44,160
is new for you so yeah that's okay but

00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:46,200
also like so they know like oh I

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,700
shouldn't take on a 50-hour task and

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,709
then move to Australia the week later

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,430
because i'm not going to actually have

00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:56,190
time to finish this thing if you can

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,950
also communicate the complexity of the

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,740
task that is also helpful so if it's you

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,360
know if you're like oh we think this

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,670
will probably have about like seven

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,160
different moving parts that also gives

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,589
people a sense of like is this something

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,320
that is a good test for me to take on or

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:17,010
how long will it take me personally to

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,930
do this also telling them who else might

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,029
be involved like who's going to be doing

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,620
patch review things like that so that

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,120
they're not they don't feel like they've

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,890
done something wrong when they get an

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,260
email out of the blue from someone else

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,120
that's involved like oh I screwed up

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,579
someone else is checking in so that

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,430
they're not surprised like oh yeah Jim

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:37,300
is totally

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,860
note about that like Nori's so talk

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,589
about what they can do when they get

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,020
bottlenecked and so they're empowered to

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,390
do more so if they hit a bottleneck let

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,060
them know like it's it's not that you

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:52,450
took a wrong turn or you are doing it

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,810
wrong come to me or go here look here

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:58,300
ask this person whatever kind of a thing

00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,520
they need to do to move on but what you

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,880
don't want is people like sadly thinking

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,439
like I did it wrong I'll just wait cuz

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,630
that's not good that's like a crummy

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,089
feeling like oh I was moving along at

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,160
this greek clip and now it's like mmm

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:16,089
like someone shot my horse and i'm like

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,089
stuck in the desert so another thing you

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,449
can do ya is to model good like your

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:25,030
ideal delegate behavior for yourself so

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,819
um asking polite questions when you need

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,080
clarification and having people model

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,420
that on the mailing list for they're

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,059
like okay I forget like you forgot to

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,460
tell me what that acronym stands for or

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:38,470
maybe you want to remind the list like

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,830
how come you're not doing it this way or

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,510
something like that and taking on more

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,750
when you can without stepping on toes

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,460
we're also stepping back when you have

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,040
taken on too many things and showing

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,370
folks that that's okay and then it's

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,650
really really important um if you can

00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:00,400
like folks who come to your project know

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:02,410
that not finishing something and just

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,320
sort of burying it and sitting on it for

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:08,650
weeks and weeks is so not the good way

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,500
to do it and that handing something off

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,860
or handing it back is like yeah we love

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,309
you gold stars all that stuff just be

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,740
sure that is kind of like baked in so

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:24,400
you know so say that and then like have

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,350
people snarking an IRC like Sally didn't

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,690
finish the thing and like you know so

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,050
make sure it's like oh okay well it's an

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,000
opportunity someone else can seek it on

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,710
so the more of an idea that people will

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,639
have like what's going to happen going

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,919
in the more happy

00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:44,539
are going to be as the their task or

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:47,989
their mentorship by you goes on so

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,609
people good were like I don't know if if

00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:54,399
people other if you guys have other

00:18:49,609 --> 00:19:00,079
questions feel free to dig in okay so

00:18:54,399 --> 00:19:02,089
mad girls versus micro um it's I think

00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,129
everyone here has a mission statement or

00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:08,239
like a overall goal for their projects

00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:11,179
right maybe okay oh all right in your

00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:13,009
mind if you can't say what it is and it

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,879
should be on your website anyway but

00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:18,109
that's a whole other conversation but

00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:21,799
sometimes people are doing like a little

00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:23,570
micro task and they start to feel like

00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,259
they've been given the take out the

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:30,529
garbage task all the time so if you can

00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:33,409
try and tie the micro task to the macro

00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:37,009
goal and let them know like how it works

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:39,950
its way up to the macro goal that is

00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,570
very empowering for people there's a

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,899
couple of things that happen there like

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,979
you might want to sort of think of your

00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,379
tasks that you have within your project

00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:51,109
as a pyramid so you have your goal at

00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:53,719
the top and then you have like maybe

00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:55,159
like various broad strategies like we're

00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:56,989
going to build a client side and a

00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,609
server-side thing of whatever it is

00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:01,099
you're trying to do and then you have

00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:03,739
specific tactics or parts that make up

00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:05,959
each of your strategies like so plugins

00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:08,989
or user interface or you know smaller

00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:10,820
bits and then the you know you get kind

00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:14,539
of do the things that are a lot of like

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,729
bugs and triage and documentation and so

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,589
maybe sure that people understand that

00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:23,119
those things all kind of feed into the

00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:25,219
goal is great and also making sure that

00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,889
folks understand that the smaller tasks

00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:30,049
lead into the bigger tasks like nobody

00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:32,029
starts in at the top like writing a

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:34,279
mission statement and then expecting

00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:37,729
people to fill in they they did all of

00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:40,190
the little bits along the way you know

00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:42,649
so you can one way to kind of really

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,650
drive this home is if you you know have

00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:46,480
someone like wow this is

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,730
like three months on this bug triage and

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,130
just let them know like you know Jim

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,030
started here too so you're going to be

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,800
good or whatever it is it's just making

00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,650
sure that people know the micro in

00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,090
aggregate really makes them macro happen

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:11,200
so that they feel important right okay

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:14,590
so um let's talk about it so how are we

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,810
on time okay all right so we talked

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:20,560
about what motivates people in a general

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:23,380
sense but it's very important to know

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,310
what motivates your individual people in

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,760
a specific sense and the best way to

00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:32,950
find that out is to ask them it's as

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,090
sometimes that's revolutionaries but it

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,380
is really the best way to find that out

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,740
one of the things that I really like

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,600
from the world of organizing is doing

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,950
what's called a one-on-one so after

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,540
someone's done like that first little

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,570
bit of work or their first piece of

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,370
something you kind of find out like hey

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,550
how did that go how did you feel about

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,610
that how does this fit in with your goal

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,350
it's like your CS student or like you've

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,960
been working on another project before

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,270
or oh you're trying to build up your

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,570
resume because you're between gigs all

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,670
of those things will help you get them

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,130
into other tasks that will help them

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,620
with their personal goals so the more

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,960
you can align like work for your project

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,880
with their personal goals the more work

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,450
they're going to want to do for you so

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,370
that right that makes sense to everybody

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,440
you can also this is also when you find

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:30,370
out like that thing was really

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,700
frustrating and then you can do

00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,950
something about it like maybe your maybe

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,870
your bite sized bugs or your first

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:43,180
contributor tasks are too big and that

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,070
happens a lot because for you if you've

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,320
been there for years like it's like oh

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,090
that would take me ten minutes sometimes

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,130
the place to start is to delegate

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:54,040
something that feels like it's too small

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,240
to delegate which feels like it's taking

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,450
your time

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,250
but I don't think of that as have you

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,450
written like a technical interview or

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,630
they asked you to solve a little problem

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,760
at the end or they asked like for my

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,950
work like I get asked to submit like a

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,580
writing sample and that type of things

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,179
so think of like a bite-size bug or a

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,980
task that is too small to delegate as

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:22,770
fulfilling that sort of function but for

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,770
your unpaid contributors so oh yeah

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:34,600
right exactly and and that's yeah it

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,510
can't it can't be underestimated like

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,850
the just finding out if someone can do a

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,040
good job and a conscientious job like it

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,290
might not work but if they followed all

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,080
the rules like oh I did the headers the

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,300
way you told me and I did the bug

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,700
process that way you told me I submitted

00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,470
it to the person that you told me to all

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,970
of those kinds of things that lets you

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,220
know like okay I can work with this

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,870
person they're worth spending my time on

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,790
so another thing you find out that the

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,620
tasks that in your mind go together

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,900
aren't the tasks that actually go

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,390
together so a lot of a more mature

00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,179
projects have like that one person like

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,850
you know like Bob or Julie and they do

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,650
like all the things or they do like some

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,470
swath of things that because they've

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,110
been doing them together for so long

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,030
seem like they go together but it's when

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,429
you're looking for new contributors and

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,130
new folks for your project you're not

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:32,410
looking for like another Julie because

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,720
that's what's kind of weird but it's

00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,400
you're looking for someone who can take

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,530
on some of the things that Julie was

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,200
doing so you usually will have to pull

00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:44,650
them apart and and that is totally okay

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,720
it's you know what if it you know

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,580
instead of Julie you know have like six

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,440
new contributors that are on their way

00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,590
to taking on lots of things so that's

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,730
that's opportunity it's not a like man I

00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,670
sure wish we could just find another

00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:02,390
Julie so with these conversations you

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,180
may find out that

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,310
your project doesn't value the work that

00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,910
you actually need done and there's a

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:14,120
couple of fixes for that one of my

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,910
favorite examples of this is the twisted

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,800
project so they had this thing where

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,290
they had been incentivizing lines of

00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,420
code like rock-star style like so they

00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,460
had like a video game kind of you know

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,220
like top scorers and but it was like

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,380
lines of code and you know and they're

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,420
like yeah super cruel some more lines of

00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,520
code you produce like the higher up the

00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,140
thing you go and then we sort of looked

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,000
at like what their project wounded they

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,160
were getting all these patches and no

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,620
one was reviewing new people's patches

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,130
so what they did was they assigned like

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,810
a giant bonus on the scoreboard for

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,570
patch review and all of a sudden

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,760
everyone's like taking patches for

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,290
review just as soon as they arrive like

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,360
well I got that one I got that one it's

00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,830
so like they see you know the person at

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,290
the top is like spending more time

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:02,450
reviewing patches than writing code but

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,190
now they have more contributors so they

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,400
incentivize the behavior that they

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:11,570
really wanted to see you know and so

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:14,000
like on that vein like you think about

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:17,480
like how many people are contributing to

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,360
your project when you thank them like in

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,400
blog posts and things like that remember

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,890
to always thank like your translators

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,100
and your documentaries and like you know

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,320
even like I work on media goblin and I

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,720
had a friend sit down and have like a

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,520
two hour lunch with me to talk about

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,320
like user experience stuff and like how

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,910
we should start to approach that she's

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,130
on the blog post for that release

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,050
because I was like you know I mean I

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,970
didn't buy her a very fancy lunch so

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:47,150
that that counts his contribution to me

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:49,910
so incentivize the kind of behavior that

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:56,270
you want to see and that is super super

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:58,490
important so let's see the last thing

00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,000
we're going to talk about is what

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,890
happens when you

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,770
kinda all goes pear-shaped and you have

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:07,590
a troublesome contributor like maybe

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,540
like there is no boss but everything

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,120
that's facilitated through you or you're

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,230
like the private mediator what do you

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,850
get what do you guys do when that

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,770
happens you have someone troublesome

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:20,940
does anyone want to tell me what they've

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:25,740
done or tried no it didn't go that well

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,390
you don't want to share alright so

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,340
there's a lot of different things you

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,200
can do you can try and like get that

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,320
person will work on something different

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,080
find a better fit for them but sometimes

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,180
it is not you it is actually them so

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:45,210
we're going to go to the live delegating

00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:51,020

body part all right and one more a bad

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:39,660
project behavior bill dozing do you want

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,660
to tell us what bulldozing is

00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:49,279
okay yeah yeah everyone knows what that

00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:51,200
responding in a frequent frequently and

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:58,340
I show us being on time to a thread and

00:29:51,200 --> 00:30:03,230
then a negative emotion rage all right

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:05,360
oh hi I hope you can help me with

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,210
something as you know we're trying to

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,639
build the snazziest xml-rpc for plumbers

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,649
that the world has ever seen in their

00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:14,869
planning the localizer for 42 countries

00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:17,090
this month everyone is working their

00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:19,360
fingers to the bone around here so we're

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,399
engaging bulldozing and makes the other

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,619
contributors feel rage and that hurts

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:32,409
the whole project what do you think we

00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:32,409
should do about that thank you thank you

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:45,019
so oh yeah it's gplv3 sorry I couldn't

00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:51,619
find an Apache version so um okay and

00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:53,600
then yes all right so that is pretty

00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,610
goofy but I hope it helps you remember

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,450
that the best course when you have like

00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:02,720
a problem contributor is to is to

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,279
address it head-on there are people do

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,070
kind of know when there's like

00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,309
whisperings and witnesses like oh yeah I

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,529
like a super awesome pizza party or we

00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:14,269
didn't we forgot to invite you so they

00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:16,159
know that something is wrong when

00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:18,080
they're like kind of going against the

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,169
grain so go ahead and address them

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,259
directly and then you know don't be the

00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:25,659
cigarette man where you're like shadowy

00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:29,919
moving things around in the background

00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:32,600
honesty is always the best policy so

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,779
let's see those are only pitcher credits

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:39,169
and then if people have questions this

00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:42,850
is them when you shoot for don't look

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:42,850
like a boss thanks very much

00:31:49,570 --> 00:32:00,400
alright so questions on any of the outer

00:31:52,370 --> 00:32:00,400
delegating or maybe the moon Serena

00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:16,799
talking about I've been in that

00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:16,799
situation a couple different times

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:56,610
that has been the I can't believe it a

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,610
day before like first I have a new work

00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:06,610
right yeah so the run on one is a great

00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,830
technique for finding out that you

00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:12,960
actually aren't a good fit like if

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:15,549
someone says you know my goal is to

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,410
whatever snazzy up your website you're

00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:20,770
like oh we really already have one

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,990
person or like our website is so tiny or

00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,179
you know something like that like either

00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:27,179
the role is taken or they want to do

00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:31,179
something that you don't need done like

00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:33,100
so uh you know like oh I I thought I

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,929
would join this anarchist group of

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,640
coders and then I think we should do a

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,980
government edition of our code and it's

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,890
like I don't think you're in the right

00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,500
place so if you have that conversation

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:47,320
then you can find out like oh you should

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,020
find a government project and go work on

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,000
that so um not every contributor is

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,340
right for every project and those soon

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,350
you find that out and do it in a nice

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,020
way before it gets all sour and weird

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,270
with goodwill like maybe they'll run

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,890
into other in our case later in life or

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,110
they'll come back around after the

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,030
government project experience like if

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,520
you leave them with the warm fuzzy like

00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:11,980
you know this isn't the best place but

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,990
good look that's way better than like

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,020
those people just kick me off the

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:20,760
mailing list and I don't know why so

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,760
other questions yeah

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:29,690
is poisonous people video yep the

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,960
prisoners people video and Donnybrook

00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,659
cole says a talk on how [ __ ] are

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,639
killing your project and he recommends a

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,070
few books in there that kind of like the

00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,740
numbers bear that out like it's what

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,500
happens when you have like one person on

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,560
your mailing list or nirc that is super

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,629
poisonous other people see that if you

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,730
don't respond to it now I oh I've been

00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,409
looking for a place to be a jerk sounds

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,200
like this place is for me so eventually

00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,780
they outnumber all of your other people

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,200
and then you're like oh man I hang out

00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,849
with jerks all day and so you gotta nip

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,980
it in the bud while you got one and be

00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,660
like hey maybe you're not aware that

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,220
you're coming off like a drip but if you

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,330
are aware you're doing it anyway then

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,339
you got to go somewhere else because

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:19,580
we're not into that in fact i'll try it

00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:21,170
privately first especially given when

00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,630
you have a worldwide project in the

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:26,060
language barrier may be a issue or like

00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,560
just like maybe they didn't check and

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,450
see what kind of what the crew of

00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,030
connaught for your community is so like

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:34,430
you know you always assume ignorance

00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,290
like oh maybe thought that was funny or

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,320
maybe you didn't know that we're not

00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:43,580
down with that here and so like I always

00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:49,150
try that first so other questions

00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:49,150
comments sure

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,280
right so how do you know if you're the

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,550
person who is supposed to be doing the

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,980
delegating um so this is more like a

00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,810
mentorship model so I think like if

00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,460
someone comes into your channel and it's

00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,260
like I need someone who can help me

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,450
figure out what's going on with this

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,100
library and then it's like crickets

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,480
crickets crickets and you go in and

00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,730
you're like I know about that library

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:22,320
then you're the person in the do aquos

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:25,470
you've just elected yourself so other

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,320
times like you know maybe like if you do

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:30,210
have one of those poisonous contributors

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,950
maybe you don't want to you know take it

00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,480
on right away but you might want to

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,270
check in the back channel and say like

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,940
hey George do you know what's going on

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,190
with contributor X like has anyone

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,470
spoken to him or her about this kind of

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,630
behavior and then like meats shirt then

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,980
instead of having them get pig pile by

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,350
like three people like you're being a

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,320
jerk you can have a conversation with a

00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:54,420
couple folks and then be like hey so you

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,150
know I'm gonna send you no like you're

00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,770
being a jerk so if you're not sure you

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,600
can always ask and be like did someone

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,610
else people don't generally like

00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,950
confrontation so if you're like can I

00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,660
can I take on the confrontation like

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,520
most of the time people will be like oh

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:17,420
yes please thank you thank you thank you

00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:17,420
so I think yeah longer in the back yeah

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,860
right

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,690
they're quite passionate about what they

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,600
do painting for the project and that's

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,850
what makes us do things what they do

00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,650
second you know I think I think with the

00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,210
winning out specifically mayor's it's

00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:37,280
important to stay objective to the

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,280
behavior and not get that carried over

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,810
right so people don't want to be jerks

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,820
and then also making sure that you're

00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,420
criticizing the behavior and not the

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,720
person and that's extremely important

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,790
it's a nothing gets something someone

00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,670
more inflamed than saying you're

00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:00,030
whatever it is but to say like that

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:02,490
behavior was jerky yeah over ever

00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:05,160
appropriate adjective for whatever the

00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,190
behavior is I think the time for one
