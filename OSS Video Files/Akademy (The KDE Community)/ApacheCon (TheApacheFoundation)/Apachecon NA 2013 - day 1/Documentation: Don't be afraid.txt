yeah afternoon everyone my name is noren

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,919
Plunkett I've been writing documentation

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,370
for about a decade now which is you know

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,139
very long time in internet time I don't

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,940
have business cards but my usual title

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,850
at work is a geek to english translator

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,170
and more more recently I've been known

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,430
as a force multiplier this is the second

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,130
time we've had a patch econ in my

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,349
hometown in 2006 me through it in Dublin

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,279
and I believe in here in Portland for

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,950
the last year and a half I've been

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,670
working on documentation at Apache since

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,000
about two thousand five and although I

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,700
was always very interested in science

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,980
and maths and that kind of stuff English

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,200
was my absolutely least favorite subject

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,420
the only thing i liked less than English

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,870
was classics which was like English but

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,949
more writing and in harder languages

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,620
luckily you don't have to be a good

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,170
writer to write good documentation and

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,190
so that's why I'm here to to give you

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,129
some of the things that I've learned

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,900
over over my time a written

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,970
documentation everywhere from Microsoft

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:15,600
to google from apache2 to the irish

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,210
government and if you don't know why

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,360
documentation might be useful you may be

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,590
in the wrong room parks tomcat

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,420
clustering talk i can highly recommend

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,579
his nexon speaker but I had a great plan

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,439
for this talk I had it all written out i

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,500
had my citations i had all sorts of

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,329
research and then we hit a bar camp on

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,040
sunday and like so much an open source

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,479
you got together and you start talking

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,060
to people and suddenly the whole plan

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,950
changes so this is going to be a

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,740
slightly less formal talk than i had

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,689
planned so if you have questions feel

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,149
free to just raise your hand will get a

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,950
mic too please don't ask the questions

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,080
till you get the mic because that way we

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,910
can catch it all on the

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,620
writing and if you take your seats nice

00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,760
and quickly that way we can get me on

00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,850
the recording and not the back of your

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,620
head so good documentation saves time

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,509
for everybody it saves time for your

00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,970
users they learn what they need to get

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,710
what they want to do done it says time

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,530
for you you spend less time answering

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,940
questions on IRC so less time whining on

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,340
IRC about the questions you're having to

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,110
answer my IC spend less time having

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,260
group therapy about all the whining

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,760
that's going on and so on and so forth

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,550
the writing documentation will also

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,440
improve your code straight up a study

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,940
with documentation that's in the list of

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,870
sites and again these will all be online

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,060
later study from McGill found that

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,310
working on documentation actually led

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,550
directly to improvements in code quality

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,260
which i think is pretty cool but most

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,080
importantly if you write even vaguely

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,990
possible documentation you will win more

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,490
friends than you can imagine I've been a

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,080
professional writer for several years

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,350
and as I said I've been contributing

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,600
documentation and apache for longer than

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,130
laughs and I can honestly say that on

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,650
every mailing list I've ever joined

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,959
every IRC channel i've run out of every

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,510
conference I've gone to there is nothing

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:15,350
to making friends like saying oh yeah I

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:17,269
like the dogs but like a blank page

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,250
getting started on documentation can be

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,800
a bit scary so we're going to spend the

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,300
next hour so figuring out what you need

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,820
building up a little bit of a structure

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,860
to make things easier and looking at

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,560
where you can get quick wins and easy

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,690
starts there are some things though that

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,959
we're not going to look at their

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,380
important that's fine but they're more

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,489
on the formal side and really it's easy

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,489
to get bogged down in the details

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,970
generally don't worry too much about

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,280
your grammar if you're having an

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,720
argument that whether or not a sentence

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,150
is correctly structured scrappin Lee

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,920
it don't worry about whether your verbs

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,750
and your nouns are matching and all of

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,790
that that's okay just to write the

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,710
sentence a different way have those

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,690
arguments fine have them on English

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,790
doubt stack overflow that's great if

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,870
that's your passion brilliant but don't

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,100
let it stop you from writing

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,350
documentation and again these fees very

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,950
sort of deliberately written to be as

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,570
awful as they could be most of the stuff

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,230
you run against really isn't that hard

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,270
to read even if your grandma's a bit off

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,070
punctuation sale again if you're not

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,890
sure about whether a sentence is clear

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,490
rewrite it if the sentence is getting

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,080
long split it up that's okay if you

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,240
really want a background on basic

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,320
writing in good English I'm a big fan of

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,360
the Oxford guide to play in English

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,800
there are so many books and guides out

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,870
there you could be reading as long as

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,010
you like but please start writing so the

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,600
first question when it comes to

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,680
documentation who is going to write it

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,630
and the obvious answer is anybody can

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:02,340
I'm the most common corollary to that is

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,440
anybody but me and again the McGill

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,150
study that I was talking about earlier I

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,370
actually found that having a separate

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,550
documentation team led to a poor

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,440
experience for everyone the docs teams

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,600
and the users became frustrated because

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,820
Doc's tended to lag behind code more

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,640
severely than on projects for code and

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,380
docks were written by the same team and

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,180
the code quality suffered because of

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,250
that divided developers were less aware

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,140
of his birdie issues there were less

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,780
likely to thoroughly test their code

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,280
documentation was often written based on

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,780
what the developers said the code was

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,090
going to do before they wrote the code

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,350
and while the developers say the code is

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,430
going to do before they write it and

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,820
what the code actually does when they're

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:46,220
finished writing it are very rarely

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,050
same thing it's pretty common to use

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,780
documentation as an entry point to

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,030
contribution to any open source project

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,620
and that's great and it's how I got

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,620
started doing open source work and I'm

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,170
all in favor of it but you do need to do

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,690
some prep work if you're going to use

00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,270
that as an on-ramp have a list of dark

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,760
rugs have a wish list really importantly

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,760
have some mentoring have people who are

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,460
there and available to help out because

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,030
writing is great and it's ninety-nine

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,560
percent of what you need but ninety-nine

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,410
percent of the frustration comes from

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,210
how do i check out how do i make these

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,650
changes in the XML how do I build the

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,450
XML and make sure that I haven't broken

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,160
everything what do I do with that patch

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,400
do i send it in line or do i attach it

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,860
to nail those are the hurdles that are

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,140
so small and so easy to get over once

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,340
you've been doing it for a while but

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,930
they are huge frustration for newbies

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,450
the best time to write documentation is

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,370
right now and I give all that any of you

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,470
who have your laptop's open if you are

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,990
writing documentation you have my full

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,090
blessing to continue doing so keep at it

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,420
that's great I don't you consider my

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,130
talk and right away that's fine the most

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,570
important thing is to get the things out

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,100
of your head and onto paper or electrons

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:06,020
as long as the documentation is in your

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,210
head it's not accessible to anyone else

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,400
and that means your users can't get it

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,550
but it also means that other people

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,230
can't help you improve it whatever you

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,120
write doesn't need to be complete or

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,780
final and in fact it will never be

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,490
complete or final happily for us our

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,200
readers have access to the source code

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,200
the mailing list the IRC channel

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,730
whatever other resources we have but if

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,620
you write things down people will bug

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:34,010
you less often and they'll have some

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,470
chance to contribute back now I have a

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,390
question for all of you I'm Irish I've

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:44,210
been out this a while am i speaking too

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:47,000
quickly great just checking in so what

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,830
is documentation anyway back to the

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,120
formal part

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,270
the presentation that i have prepared

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,800
and written up since about october

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,990
writers often divided ducks into three

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,790
categories based on the needs that they

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,850
serve so we have conceptual

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:04,480
documentation task-based documentation

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,090
and reference documentation conceptual

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,670
docs are probably the hardest kind for a

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,290
newbie to start off with but conversely

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,360
if you already know the system you're

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,850
talking about they can be the easiest to

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,160
write they covered up why of the system

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,660
the overview here's the idea here's what

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,690
we were trying to achieve with this

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,350
project to a piece of software or module

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,240
or whatever it is reference docs cover

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,280
more of the wash therefore someone who

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,220
already understands the concept and

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,830
probably knows how to use the system but

00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,930
needs a quick answer to a question what

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,530
are the flags I need to use to ontar

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:43,770
this file can I use my old 60 watt power

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:47,110
supply with my new shiny 45 or laptop

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,890
what the argument I need to force s say

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,010
she is an ipv4 connection unlike

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:56,800
conceptual and task-based docs a lot of

00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,450
these can be automatically generated so

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,660
you can just have your Java doc or your

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,350
pie doc throw out this this reference

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,300
documentation a lot of the time

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,590
unfortunately we only have a little bit

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,600
of time today so we're not going to go

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:14,190
into all of those systems but I'm happy

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,210
to talk about those outside later I

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,610
remember third type of documentation

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,950
procedural docs are your how to's you

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,110
step-by-step through tutorials this can

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,430
also be your video casts in your podcast

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,340
so don't actually have to be written

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,050
text these are generally easier than

00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,030
conceptual docs for a newbie to write

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,340
and any of you who were in Deb's talk

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,560
earlier and saw that curve of where do

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,790
you write the documentation you know I'm

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,380
starting down here

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,650
I know absolutely nothing about the

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,850
system to have the whole thing done when

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,380
you're starting down here and have

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,680
absolutely no idea what you're doing

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,210
writing down every step you take even if

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,620
it ends up being backtracking and I

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,870
didn't need to do that or I did that

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,740
wrong or I got to step 6 and then

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,560
realized I should have done something

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,620
else at step three is actually a good

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,920
way of getting a procedural doc started

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,300
and where do we put our dogs again this

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,400
is another thing that I think has

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:13,030
changed yep sorry question grab a mic

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:18,840
please okay how can we persuade our

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:21,280
users to submit to us document to the

00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,400
trouble that they have reading our

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,380
documentation right up front how can you

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,700
persuade users to tell you about the

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,790
trouble they are having reading the

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,990
double agent the idea is that new people

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,930
are not afflicted by the curse of

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,500
knowledge and we want to exploit that

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,750
yeah and so in order to do that we need

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,850
new people to actually start writing

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,880
documentation or to at least give us

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,070
some idea about what is confusing yeah I

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,200
found hanging out on the IRC channel is

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,850
great for that because we've got we've

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,900
got the documentation written down and

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,180
somebody comes in and asks a question

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,890
that you think of course that's an easy

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,720
thing people do that ten times a day

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,600
that's no problem it's documented right

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,490
here and the user comes back she knows

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,110
but I can't and at that point it takes a

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,370
little more question you say but but you

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,230
can't what I had I used to work on a

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,270
tech support in the hospital and at one

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,200
point I had a doctor phone me up and

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,550
telling me that he couldn't read his

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,770
email and it took us a series of course

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,300
it took us probably seven minutes to

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,680
work out in his computer receiving in

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,960
three inches of water and he did have

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,540
the good sense not stretch on but what

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,730
he said to me was I can't read my email

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,600
and so that troubleshooting questioning

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,100
which is the same for you know sis

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,620
admin's troubleshooting why the system

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,540
isn't working is also what you need to

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,399
discover what's what's wrong with your

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,080
dogs okay what are you trying to do what

00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,660
does the dark side to do how did you do

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:57,860
that okay what went wrong what did you

00:11:51,660 --> 00:12:00,300
see that's how I'd suggest doing it um

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,390
so where do you put your document did

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,100
you have a question sorry oh that like

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,570
if if you have something that's one on

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,580
one do you have people read all the time

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,500
than putting a giant thing at the top

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,760
that invites people to submit life

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,320
improvement that's a great plan if you

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,110
have something that people are reading

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,050
all the time or particularly something

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,750
that's your you know the first my first

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,820
whatever my first deployment my first

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,830
webpage putting something at the top

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,540
saying please send us your comments

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,520
having a comment field at the bottom

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,709
saying did this work for you tell us

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,959
what did or didn't work having a call

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:39,839
out to say please email us here and tell

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,670
us how this went for you positively and

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,310
negatively because it's really great

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,250
feedback for documentation team to hear

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,880
yes I went through this i read this doc

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,990
and I got it working all too often we

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,350
hear the complaints are not the

00:12:51,990 --> 00:13:00,020
compliments so any of those kinds of

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:02,190
call outs are great to have yep I think

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,740
additional reading a bad thing in the

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,879
sense that especially authority

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,069
like I specially taken your doctor's

00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,750
examples in the phone call one I don't

00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:13,449
the other side of it like when I get mad

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,009
when they call simple person makes me do

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,899
all these temples are find a button to

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,430
figure out the power and a distance just

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,720
tell me call of my laptop I figure it

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,519
out they don't want them to tell me

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,920
where or what needs to put your finger

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
yeah so different audiences have

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,129
different needs for documentation and

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,129
we'll get to that a little bit later

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:36,279
before of where do you put your

00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:40,660
documentation has changed drastically in

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:43,629
the last even even in the last year when

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,089
I started writing documentation we had

00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:49,060
these silos we had you know the httpd

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,670
docs are on HTTP dude at Apache dot org

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,399
slash dogs if you want the PHP docs you

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:57,819
go to PHP website if you want pearl dark

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,519
it's it's in Pro and nowadays that's no

00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:03,639
longer where we look for information

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,980
stack overflow stop overflow is the

00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:11,259
canonical documentation for so many

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,750
open-source projects blogs so much

00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:16,779
documentation is on blogs we're no

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,750
longer really browsing the web so many

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,759
of us now are searching and that has

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,139
advantages and disadvantages but it is

00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,069
the reality we're living in right now

00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:30,519
and so where you put your dogs in terms

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:32,379
of a hierarchy is much less important

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,410
than it was how you arrange those docs

00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:39,069
among themselves still has great value

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,930
in use making it easy to find the

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:43,329
connections between the conceptual and

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,870
the reference stuff that goes together

00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:50,500
is great but whether it's on a wiki or a

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,470
static web page or wherever it is is no

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,509
longer worth spending a whole lot of

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,100
time agonizing over oh well microphones

00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:03,220
use far away but I'm pretty like

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,209
annotate up well I just wanted to see

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,980
off of your remark

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,769
everyone's searching that SEO is

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,929
important I've had a few experiences and

00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,929
patchy projects where relatively obvious

00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:16,420
Google queries yielded astonishingly

00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:18,490
unhelpful Google results yeah and

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,800
definitely that's not that's that's a

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,179
certain black heart of its own yeah so

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,429
the comment was that if everybody is

00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:27,029
searching then SEO becomes important and

00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:30,249
I think the Apache dogs team have had a

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,740
change of heart in the last few years as

00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:34,600
we've realized that yes everybody is now

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,800
searching an SEO some degree is

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,779
important I would say if you're if

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,619
you're going to go for that kind of

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:46,420
thing please don't search for SEO go to

00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:48,519
something like Google's webmaster tools

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,699
and look at what they're suggesting make

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,759
sure you have in the metadata your

00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:57,369
canonical docs represented as canonical

00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,490
use redirects that actually send a 30

00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:04,929
code rather than a 200 and just redirect

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,779
you yes that stuff is important but

00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:16,179
someone outside the scope of this talk

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:18,100
yep yes all contributions are valid and

00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:20,170
much-loved and if you can make that

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,059
stuff work infrastructure will be happy

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,980
to talk to you the docs teams will be

00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:31,809
happy to talk to you let's get it

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:33,040
working the slight exception to it

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,709
doesn't really matter where you put it

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,869
is probably conceptual documentation

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:41,019
which tends to be most useful if it's

00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:42,910
well curated it doesn't need to be

00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:46,689
updated terribly often usually the

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:50,769
concepts behind your technology tend not

00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:52,269
to shift as rapidly as say the specific

00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,600
API calls you might or might not be

00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:56,550
making and it's usually

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,699
easy to tell if a task-based document is

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:05,189
out of date because you start stepping

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:06,720
through the tasks and it fails but if a

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,150
conceptual doc is out of date that's

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,890
harder to recognize as somebody coming

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,750
in and reading it and so that stuff

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,419
needs to be reviewed by somebody who has

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,020
the expertise on hopefully a relatively

00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:20,819
regular basis ideally of course all of

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,819
your documentation would be kept in some

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,799
kind of a version control and ideally

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,569
you would have copies of it somewhere

00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,210
that is now I'm going to disappear at

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:36,270
the whim of you know it fell off the

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:41,880
front page of hacker news but we do what

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:43,650
we can and task documentation again

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,409
because it's nice and easy to see when

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,289
the task documentation stops working

00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:51,000
should ideally be easy to update and I

00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:54,390
ideally easy for newcomers to contribute

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,940
to or to change when I can when I come

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,880
into a project I'm you know I come to

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,100
get repo I install whatever I need to

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,350
install I realize that package no longer

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,570
exists or has a new name I find what it

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,460
is I need to install uninstall it would

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,039
be great if I can just very quickly say

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,710
here's a patch pull requests send an

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,020
email whatever it is and the only thing

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,740
I would encourage anybody who is already

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,659
in a project to do is accept bug reports

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,750
in whatever form they come in if

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:27,240
somebody sends you a tweet saying this

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,260
thing on this page is wrong don't send

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,470
them off and make them go through

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,289
bugzilla because honestly and I say this

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,270
as I I'm pretty confident I'm one of the

00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,030
younger people in this room the other

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,410
may have

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:48,040
find when you were my age we have new

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:51,430
expectations now so accept bug reports

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,380
on facebook on Twitter people Navin you

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,210
in the hallway it's fine if somebody

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,730
nads you in the hallway to say to them p

00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,320
send me an email or write it down I have

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,960
occasionally written bug reports on my

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,280
hand because if you just tell me and I

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,590
haven't got anything written down it's

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,420
not going to happen but if it's written

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:12,820
down take it a bug report really is the

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,800
first contribution and it's great to

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,690
encourage those people and get them

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:21,640
hooked so again the how was there was a

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,580
lot of sort of writing theory in here

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,730
involving different ways of getting

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,710
started and so on but get started write

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,120
it down talk to each other when you're

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,440
talking to each other somebody pull out

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,090
your phone cuz now we all have phones

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,670
that can do this and just record

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:40,000
explaining the new module to somebody

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,980
else just record it and if you want to

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
make a podcast great we have people who

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,270
would be love to talk to you about that

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,520
if you just want to type up what you've

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,360
said put it down in some kind of slop

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,460
dog get started one way or the other

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,150
where you whip us up the doc sprint at

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,610
Google by the other the other great way

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,380
of getting started is copying copying

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,420
stuff that's that's already out there

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,490
that's on blog posts that's on

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,350
stackoverflow is on be carefully a

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,040
little bit about the license but by

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:15,580
using this a team of twenty four of us I

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,710
think we were six full rightful writers

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,060
and 20 engineers managed to write for

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,470
books in three days last October so so

00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,990
thank you do

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:31,419
great way to get documentation done the

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:33,460
information is largely out there the

00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:34,870
first principle of good technical

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,970
writing once we go from getting

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,510
something down to getting something good

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,610
is to make it simple good technical

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,919
writing should be essentially invisible

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,870
we do should be thinking about the ideas

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,880
about the technology about the solutions

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,980
about what they're going to do with this

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,620
cool new stuff and not about your

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,840
writing nobody is going to curl up in

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,600
front and fire with a cup of cocoa and

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,549
the technical manual actually that's not

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,429
true i have writers tell me this all the

00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:05,230
time writers are the only people who are

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,330
going to curl up into the morrow in a

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,309
cup of cocoa and respect nathaniel and

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,809
it's very important that we have our

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,780
communities to do that and i'm fully

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:18,220
supportive of that but the rest of you

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,289
are not need to do that it's not that

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,740
your audience can't understand complex

00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:26,049
writing it really isn't we have some of

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,299
the best and the brightest here they can

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:33,220
understand the worst things that i can

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:35,200
write but they shouldn't have to the

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,549
second principle is that no document is

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,710
ever finished that's okay creating a

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,630
document in theory happens in three

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,850
phases you think about it you write it

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,220
and you revise it the problem is that

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:54,850
then you revise it and you revise it and

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:57,490
you revise it and don't bother trying to

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,200
get to the end get it good enough don't

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,440
even necessarily bother getting to good

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,419
enough get to okay that's fine somebody

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,559
else can come along and somebody else

00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:10,270
will do a better job than you can by

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,710
coming along later and looking at it

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:16,570
with a fresh set of eyes at my day job

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,510
and I hope I won't get in trouble for

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,760
saying this but

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,190
day job we discovered just before our

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,220
last release but there were two sections

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,160
in the documentation that had title I

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,870
mean they had a meaningful title the one

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,620
I remember off the top of my head was

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:38,050
creating a user password and the content

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,050
for that section was content goes here

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:44,990
that can't be mean our user manual for

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:49,250
at least one major version and like

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,720
several minor revisions with me mad and

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,220
nobody would spar with it because the

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,500
right had gone right we need a creating

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,270
user password section they had made you

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,560
know the boilerplate for it they had

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,240
gotten busy they've gone off and done

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,600
something else the same writer had

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,640
reviewed their work but they knew that

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,300
they were going to write that they just

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,070
haven't quite gotten so it's okay leave

00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:16,030
it put it down let someone else to look

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:18,770
at it so when you're getting started

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,450
again we're back to sort of slightly the

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,430
more formal stuff there are some good

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,310
questions you can start off with for any

00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:27,020
document I learnt them as who is my

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,090
audience what is the purpose of this

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,980
document and what will my audience be

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:35,120
able to do after reading this document

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,830
when you're doing formal technical

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,610
writing you often have an identifiable

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:42,380
audience you have a contract to provide

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,240
you know a document for the end user

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,320
who's going to be putting the batteries

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,660
into the toy at Christmas or the

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,220
electrician who's going to be installing

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,490
you know the fuse box in the house or

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,380
whatever it is even within IT you

00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,540
sometimes have reasonably clearly

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,260
defined audiences end users developers

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:06,050
sis admin's implementers various

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,000
permutations is that writing for open

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:13,190
source you often don't have anything

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,020
that clear and a lot of people will come

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,300
looking for different things in the same

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,070
Docs and they'll come looking for things

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,790
you never intended them to come looking

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,160
for the best suggestion I can give you

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,750
is pick an audience pick one make one up

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,880
in the same way the product

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,790
teachers have their user stories you

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,340
also need your user stories decide who

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,080
you're writing for right for them link

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,270
off to other things that say if you are

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,920
not already at this level here's where

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,930
you can get started if you've already

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,480
got all this stuff down here's where you

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,700
can find more information but don't try

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,340
and write for everybody in the same dock

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,620
it'll end up annoying you and annoying

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,720
your readers you'll find out soon enough

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,980
if the audience you've picked is the

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,420
wrong one or if you need to write a

00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,200
second document for another audience

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,190
people are really good at complaining

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:07,880
especially people who are getting

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:14,960
something for free so do you have any

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:16,790
more questions I can yep or anything

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,680
like the developers out there they could

00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,630
go to the Kings but use this one was

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,910
quickly get it get there by staying in a

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,500
short time span like sometimes you see

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,540
three clicks someone doesn't want to

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,730
keep looking until you find what they

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,890
want so based on the audience or

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,600
anything which we keep like up a website

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,750
up prominently we need to give a quick

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,090
introduction okay so the question I

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,930
think is are there any best practices

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,550
for where you put the document or how

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,410
you allow people to navigate to the

00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:50,060
document based on the audience of the

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,920
document and I think I go back I go back

00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,260
partly to my assertion that nobody

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,820
browses anymore people just search I do

00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:01,310
give the caveat though that coming into

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,000
a project new and i still find this with

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,590
the httpd docs i have great trouble

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,330
finding where is the developer's guide

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,030
for the software and where is the

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,460
developer's guide for the dogs and so if

00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:16,580
you have projects that are different

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:21,320
that operate differently it's worth

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:24,950
making that very clear if it's all the

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,230
same project then I think you don't need

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,650
to worry quite so much about it three

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,480
clicks is is great if you can do it but

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,070
if it means you have a page that's just

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,230
this big long list of links and and

00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:41,450
there isn't a sort of a narrative

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,450
guiding people through that it's no help

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,350
yeah make it clear make it clear what

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:56,960
they're finding perhaps more than

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:59,429
worrying about click click click okay so

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,750
this is just an example of some of the

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,690
questions we could ask for a

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:07,879
hypothetical document I think I actually

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:10,500
wrote this back when we worked together

00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:15,389
which is it's the facsimile a million

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,070
years ago but um are you writing for

00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:19,740
what background do they have what

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:27,500
background do they need what topics you

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:27,500
need to cover do you need to sorry oops

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,899
so yeah who are you writing for um what

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,610
background do they need do you need to

00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:37,529
teach them about the calendaring program

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:40,649
that you're using or do you need to

00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:42,299
teach them about scheduling resources so

00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:45,450
for example at my current job we have a

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,700
vacation calendar which in our current

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,100
calendaring system is technically a room

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,759
and so you booked the room for while

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,539
you're on vacation do you need to teach

00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,669
them about local local etiquette so for

00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,529
example people should block off certain

00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:04,470
times if their remote working and

00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:07,200
they're going to be sleeping say in the

00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,879
evenings I don't know when you have a

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,399
company that's distributed around the

00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:13,409
world occasionally you end up with 5am

00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,539
meetings and it's just about our

00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:17,129
somebody didn't sometimes it somebody

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,700
knows that they're doing that and

00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:22,440
they're just really you know that's

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,909
that's when it's got to be because it's

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,220
got to be at a bad time for someone and

00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:34,049
sometimes it's well I thought you were

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:36,960
in San Francisco oops is that is that

00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:42,990
actually readable or should I call out

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:44,460
those questions it is readable great the

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,429
other great thing about starting with

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,779
these kinds of questions is that if

00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,909
once you write down the answers to these

00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,340
questions you have a pretty solid first

00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:54,470
paragraph this is a trick I actually

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,570
write back in school that you have your

00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,249
set piece of questions you write down

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:02,029
the answers to those questions and then

00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:03,379
your essay has already started people

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,299
who find your doc if you've answered

00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:06,919
these questions can tell pretty quickly

00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:10,309
whether it's the document they're

00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:16,999
looking for whether it's suitably

00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:19,789
advanced to advanced what they need on a

00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:22,129
less formal level before you get too far

00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:23,929
in you need to think not only about who

00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:26,330
you're what you're writing but how

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,889
you're writing it are you writing for an

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,519
audience who are new to the topic and

00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:33,409
you need to explain terms I I say always

00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,769
expand acronyms the first time you use

00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:39,860
them again at my current day job our

00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:44,240
software has four major components it

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,999
has the node controller just the NC the

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,619
storage controller which is the SC the

00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:53,769
cloud controller and the cluster

00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:53,769
controller which are the CLC and the CC

00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:01,279
so I suggest that every time you use an

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,409
acronym expand it the first time and

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,360
then you can go ahead and use the

00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,799
acronym and that way so many who jumps

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,749
in in the middle of the doc because

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,690
let's face it people do not read your

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:13,850
manuals from beginning to end they jump

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:16,279
in at the point where they think they'll

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,779
probably find the answer they want and

00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,570
they hope you find it there and if they

00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:25,999
don't they jump somewhere else this is

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:28,009
this is not a linear path are you

00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:29,480
writing for somebody who's maintaining

00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,840
something that's already set up where

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,570
you may need to take it into account

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,070
sorry so where you may need to take into

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,720
account that different people have

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,970
different configurations they have

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,929
different options that you can't simply

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,879
tell them you know put this in as your

00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:49,009
config file because they may already

00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:51,259
have a config file that has options that

00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,960
they need and so you say well amend your

00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:56,169
conflict file this way or I'd be

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,580
things are added these things are you

00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:59,799
writing for an audience who are trying

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,809
to decide whether or not your tool is

00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,090
the right tool or trying to decide

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,799
between your tool and other tools in

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,110
which case they may need to know more

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:10,029
about the differences the similarities

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,220
what does your till do that others don't

00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:16,059
and what does your to lack that others

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,159
might have and it's always good to think

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:22,390
what are my audience going to be able to

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:24,279
do when I'm finished writing this going

00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,429
back to the three kinds of documents the

00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,809
conceptual task and reference a

00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:31,270
conceptual dark is likely to have a

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,559
purpose of illuminating some subject and

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,779
once the audience is finished reading

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,230
they'll be able to make a decision or

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:40,450
see how components fit together a task

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,520
document should be able to guide a user

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,600
through some or other task and once

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,610
they've read it they'll be able to

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,220
complete that task install the software

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:51,460
get software running serve pictures of

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,200
cats on the internet whatever it is an a

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,270
reference dark is obviously to be

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,970
referred to hopefully once the audience

00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,080
is finished reading they will be able to

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,730
do whatever they were trying to do

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,919
before they got sidetracked by having to

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:07,149
look up the command line options for

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:09,909
your tool if you're writing in a team

00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:11,590
it's worth looking at some more sort of

00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:14,529
project management d stuff what's my

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,539
deadline do I have a deadline for a

00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:18,820
first draft or four reviews in

00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:22,990
particular who's going to do those

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:26,350
reviews and what's their deadline what's

00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,909
going to hold up the documentation where

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,850
am I going to get the information I need

00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:34,450
to write the doc what's it going to look

00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:36,340
like is it going to be an HTML page is

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:41,110
it going to be a PDF are we going to

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:44,980
print out a book what's the rough list

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,450
of contents honestly I credit the fact

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,610
that we were able to write four books in

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,980
three days to fact that we spent the

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,350
first half day working on a table of

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,490
contents for each of those books because

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,710
once you know what's going to be in

00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:00,010
there it's much easier to put it all

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:03,670
together what is the document not going

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:07,870
to contain so topics for another vision

00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:11,440
and topics for another document topics

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:13,570
for a different audience and again if

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,740
it's if it's in a formal context who's

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,410
going to sign off on this being done

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,710
because it shouldn't be you the writer a

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,630
writer is never ever finished I've never

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,420
met a writer forgot the end of their

00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:27,970
thing is that I've done now it just

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,800
hasn't happened to me so somebody else

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,020
needs to say yep we're good now and that

00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,760
can be a time-based deadline it can be a

00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,260
you know we've passed it past three

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,120
users and they all managed to do what

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,830
they were trying to do but somebody else

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,480
needs to be the arbiter of it's ready to

00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:45,580
go um structure again coming back to

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,920
that idea of the table of contents a

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,620
good document isn't just random globs of

00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,210
information thrown together ideally in

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,830
the preparation stage you thought a

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,080
little bit about where it fits in with

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,200
other things that already exist or are

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,790
on the plan to be written and by the

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,490
time you finish the first draft you

00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:06,370
should have answers to questions like

00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,200
what are the major themes it covers what

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,260
are the major sections within the doc

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,270
how do those relate to each other what

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:17,470
is the logical progression of my

00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:19,540
document it again people jump in and out

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,880
of documentation but there should

00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,260
nonetheless be a sense that if there

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,480
were to read it from beginning to end

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,640
they would have all the information that

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,790
they needed they're not going to do that

00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,620
but if you write it that way they're

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:37,900
jumping in and out is much more likely

00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:39,669
to be successful and you don't you won't

00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,890
have all of these things before you

00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:43,600
start writing but again by the time you

00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,960
go to the end of a first draft you you

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,310
should spend some time working on them

00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,750
here's a sort of a sample table of

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:56,230
contents let me just make sure it all

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:57,520
comes up here we go that works for

00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:03,310
actually a surprising number of

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,840
documents so you start with what is what

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:08,050
is this documents the answers to the

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,900
questions we would looked at earlier an

00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,260
overview of whatever the system is we're

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,420
dealing with when you'll need

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,020
that can also include what you've

00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,610
already done to get to this point and if

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,290
there are other things that are further

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,150
down the line you don't need this

00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,780
document you you need to go on to the

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:30,510
next one then we have our steps which

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,920
can be as simple as a bullet list or can

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,210
be chapters and chapters in and of

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,680
themselves and examples in sample code

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:43,350
examples are great people love examples

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,640
people love copying and pasting it's

00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,640
their favorite thing ever

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,820
troubleshooting what what can you expect

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,750
to go wrong what are the things that

00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,490
commonly trip people up if you can if

00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,680
you can put those cabinets in your dark

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,770
and say are you can look at you came

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,300
across this error that's because if not

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,870
enough space in your file system clear

00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,610
up some space or whatever it is that is

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,560
a section that's often easier to fill in

00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,790
either at the very beginning because

00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,370
you're writing this because you keep

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,230
getting the same questions or after the

00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,110
doc has been out for a month or two and

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:25,860
people keep going this dog is great but

00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:28,410
I keep getting stuck on step 6 and then

00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,090
further information again is where can

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:42,390
you go now you you have a web server

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:45,540
great pictures of cats so writing once

00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:49,350
you've got the idea of the doc the shape

00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:52,470
of the dark you've got a first draft get

00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:57,200
something down it's the only way to get

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:59,640
a first draft right copy paste

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,210
brainstorm anything you need just get

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,000
writing right breath first so write a

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,580
broad overview before you dig into the

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,120
details the details are easier to fill

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:16,830
in later and much less useful to your

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:20,370
users if they don't have the beginning

00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,900
to end on some level they can go as far

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:28,830
as they like down the whole of step

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:31,590
one and then there no very useful also

00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,210
you will never have enough time there

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,910
just is never enough time to finish

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:39,560
document and so if you have that breath

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:43,140
written it makes things easier for you

00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:46,980
complete the overview last this can seem

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,280
kind of counterintuitive but if you're

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,080
not sure what you're writing it's easier

00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,030
to write it first and then go back and

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,710
say ah here's the things I wrote that

00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,380
can also help you with that logical

00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:00,540
progression and help you see oh I left

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,240
out a bit there or I need to explain

00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:07,770
this a little more fully let's see other

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,070
traditional ways to get started

00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,380
outlining the doc creating the table of

00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,170
contents like we saw using templates

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,270
copying pasting looking at what other

00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,700
docs you have or what Doc's other

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,170
projects have this is especially fun at

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,530
Apache where all our stuff is apache

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,790
license and you can just go Yoink do be

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:33,600
careful if you're stealing from other

00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:36,330
people's documentation but nobody nobody

00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,540
I've met ever mines really within Apache

00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,590
if you if you just take their thing you

00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,580
know it's nice to put a little

00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:47,010
attribution at the end that's fine if

00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,200
you can if you can fork it in your

00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:52,560
version control and have that history

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,700
mer and maintained that's great if you

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,080
can't you know do it as text anyway

00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:01,190
people will people will be able to

00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:04,990
follow those lines yep just on that

00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:06,730
source code standard

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,340
thinking is around attribution as to

00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,950
avoid putting developers names directly

00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:15,160
an Apache code to trust that it's in the

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:17,380
version control needs to figure out here

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,660
oh boy yeah but to try to keep the

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,430
software source code as a community

00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,530
artifact rather than something somebody

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,970
goes oh such as such wrote it therefore

00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,840
she or he's the only one who can change

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:30,460
it yes absolutely apply so Brian is

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,310
talking about the traditionally have an

00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:36,369
Apache that we don't put individual

00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:40,570
names in source code and I would also

00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:42,160
say by and large we've the httpd docs

00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,780
project have had a few problems with

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,700
this but by and large we try not to put

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:50,200
author's names in in our documentation

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,670
for many reasons because it's a product

00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,230
of the community because many people

00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,380
have worked on it and it's not

00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:59,200
necessarily fair or reasonable or

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,020
community oriented to give one person

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,670
credit over others it can discourage

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,560
people from contributing because there's

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,470
a sense that this belongs to somebody or

00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,960
or or you know it's their baby and you

00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,430
can't touch it when I said a tribute

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,820
where you got it from my actually moment

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,260
if you're stealing between projects so

00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,080
if you're if you're taking something

00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,060
from the httpd project or you're taking

00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,690
something from tomcat to say that this

00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:27,850
originated in a different community but

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,420
yes i would i would generally say avoid

00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:34,690
attribution of individuals in open

00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,400
source projects it just this it's all

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,050
there it's it's saved in the version

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,359
control it must be saved in the version

00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:45,070
control if people send you patches put

00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:46,420
their name in the commit message but but

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,760
it doesn't need to be in the document

00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,290
and I think I think the world is a

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,160
better place if it's not in the document

00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:59,770
now let's go back to where we were

00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:02,920
before I dropped from the laptop so i

00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:05,109
think i mentioned simplicity before but

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,210
as you get started be careful to keep

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:09,730
your audience in mind it doesn't really

00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,740
who the audience is but whatever group

00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:15,550
you've chosen keep the document simple

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:17,560
for them what simple for one audience is

00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,180
not necessarily the same as simple for

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,540
another audience I work in a company

00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,800
that creates cloud software and my

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,589
mother phoned me while I was at the

00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,820
office a couple of weeks ago and she

00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:32,080
said to be what are you working on right

00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:34,869
now now I was trying to work on a

00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,880
document explaining how to package

00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:39,460
virtual machine images so that you could

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,359
upload them to the cloud and run them in

00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:45,339
in the cloud which broadly speaking can

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:50,859
come in not if that makes some kind of

00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:54,160
sense yeah my mother is a midwife and so

00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:55,750
I'm standing there going well I'm

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,670
writing a document that explains to

00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:02,109
people how I can wrap up the things that

00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:07,390
I have that I want to run on the

00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:09,070
software that we write and explains to

00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,420
other people how they can wrap up the

00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:14,050
things that they have that they want to

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,609
run on the same software and then I sort

00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,460
of more or less gave up because we would

00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:20,910
have to go way far back to explaining

00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:24,130
what a cloud was in a virtual machine

00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,960
but I did write an op go or five blog

00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,730
post about it which if you're looking

00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,250
for an entertaining description of

00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:35,470
virtual machine images the internet will

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:38,080
will provide my mother is not a stupid

00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,390
lady my mother is a midwife she delivers

00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,310
babies day in day out she can operate a

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:46,780
Doppler ultrasound she can do all kinds

00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:50,109
of amazing things but she doesn't have

00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,460
all of the context that I have so if

00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,560
there are prerequisites for your

00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,440
documentation call them out explicitly

00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,720
ideally linked to them if there's

00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,040
context that seems obvious try to

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,230
remember what it was like to be a

00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:07,060
beginner and then ask a beginner if

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,160
you're writing for people who should

00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,830
already have that context mention it

00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,390
link to it if you can and keep an eye on

00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,430
the questions that come up after you've

00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,810
launched your doc to make sure that your

00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,160
audience really was at the level that

00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,700
you

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,559
assuming they were at and again don't

00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,990
make your audience do more work than

00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,960
they have to consider what they do not

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,730
need to know it's very tempting to go

00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,299
into the technically interesting details

00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,920
or the cool thing you discovered but

00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:37,349
that may not be relevant for this

00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,630
document write a new one write a blog

00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:42,690
post talk about it at a conference

00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:45,210
whatever you like get your point across

00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:51,510
but this is not the place to convince

00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:54,750
people of how smart you are structuring

00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,910
your document is really important again

00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,970
jumping in and out nobody is going to

00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:02,579
read it from beginning to end but if you

00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:05,339
pretend like they were you might help

00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,809
them get to what they need most people

00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:08,849
will at least have the patience to read

00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,270
the table of contents so make that

00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,829
meaningful and your introduction should

00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,180
ideally let people know whether they're

00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:17,160
in the right place whether this is the

00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,839
doc they want and should explain the

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,760
motivation for writing the doc which

00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,160
again will help them learn whether

00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,109
they're in the right place and your

00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,960
sections ideally should be visually

00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:30,960
chunked so it should be easy to see this

00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,420
is a paragraph about creating a new user

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,180
this is a paragraph about associating

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:39,029
that user with an account make it easy

00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,410
to see where they can jump in and out so

00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:43,309
they're not jumping in in the middle of

00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:50,150
a section and going this makes no sense

00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:52,289
um first half page above-the-fold arm

00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:55,710
you know the first screen you see on

00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:58,829
your laptop clarify your audience and

00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:02,339
purpose state it explicitly but also

00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:04,020
conveyed with the title convey it with

00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:07,710
the table of contents if you have that

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,150
on on this page imply it by location in

00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,200
a dark side and we have that question

00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:16,890
earlier about three klicks location is

00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,789
important in context so if you have a

00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:22,260
set of user steps keep those together

00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:24,510
have a progression between those user

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,640
steps don't suddenly throw in some

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,750
administration halfway through the user

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,900
guide

00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,950
and orient the user as to what they're

00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,740
looking at and where they're going to

00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,630
find the other things they're looking at

00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,760
if your document has a template that's

00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,040
different to this this comes up

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,010
particularly I found in design documents

00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:52,030
follow the template don't mess with your

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:53,770
users expectations once you've got into

00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,510
the main part of the document putting

00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:59,550
things in some kind of order is useful

00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:03,310
if the information can't be found easily

00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:05,110
it might as well not be there there are

00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,540
several axes along which you can order

00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:10,270
things and sometimes they'll conflict

00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:12,280
again try and figure out what your users

00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,800
expectations are whether that's by

00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,240
looking at other docs in your set by

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,490
looking at the questions you're getting

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,840
by looking at the order people are doing

00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:24,190
things in when they get started in

00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:27,370
general the most important stuff should

00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:30,300
go first the basic stuff should go first

00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:33,300
and the general stuff should go first

00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,300
yep

00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,660
when most of our documents were writing

00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:42,309
is either reference documentation ppi

00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,559
tonicity more tutorial about the nation

00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:46,779
before documentation it's fairly

00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,430
straightforward not all be ordered the

00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:49,839
reference documentation a lot of times

00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:54,339
it's fairly straight for how about three

00:46:49,839 --> 00:47:01,960
orders as well I itself so how about

00:46:54,339 --> 00:47:04,150
when you say what um so for example in a

00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,400
set of documents which tutorials come

00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:12,910
first again a lot of this is obvious or

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,400
is obvious when you think about it the

00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:18,009
one I wrote first is not usually a good

00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:23,019
one to put first or is not necessarily a

00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:25,390
good one to put first most things it's

00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:32,999
pretty easy to see the correct order to

00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:32,999
put them in once you look at it yep

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:40,630
expectations if you're doing

00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:42,160
installation dots if you tell these are

00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:45,369
exactly how many steps there will be

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,530
because people feel tricked if like they

00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,240
go down and there's five steps on a page

00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:52,119
and then it's like oh now go to another

00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,160
page for the next five but you tell them

00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,290
there's going to be 10 so you could even

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,200
instead of next page just be like you're

00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:01,119
happy there yeah so the suggestion was

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,339
for things like installation docks even

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,170
for any kind of a task-based awkwards

00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:07,000
it's do this and this and this and this

00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:09,309
and this and this and this let people

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,440
know upfront how many steps there are

00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:14,890
and if your task is divided into

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,240
subtasks it's fine to say you know here

00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,250
here are the five things you're going to

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,760
have to do you're going to have to you

00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:24,460
know install the software set up a user

00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:27,250
running software gather the data analyze

00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:30,520
the data and each of those tasks might

00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:32,650
have five or six steps in inside them

00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,760
but if you tell people up front here's

00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,980
the things you're going to have to do

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,140
and then when you get to each one of

00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,760
those subtasks okay you're going to have

00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,940
to do five things to install the

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,329
software you have to eight things to get

00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:49,410
set up with a user whatever it is

00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:51,790
setting expectations is really important

00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:53,200
how's your putting things in order and

00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:56,079
particularly if you're looking at a

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,319
general to specific or basic to advanced

00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,589
order remember that level of detail

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:06,099
implies importance more detail implies

00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:08,950
more importance and this becomes an

00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:11,500
issue if you have several different

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,930
people writing documentation without a

00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,670
whole lot of coordination because some

00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,010
people just write very detailed

00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,559
documentation and some people just write

00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:24,309
very overview II sort of documentation

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,460
and you can end up with something that's

00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:28,990
really fairly trivial or unimportant

00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,490
looking like this is the really you have

00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,859
to understand this thing in order to get

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,200
this system when actually it's just that

00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:39,339
that was written by that guy and that's

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,290
just the way he writes so a consistent

00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:42,099
level of detail is a useful way to guide

00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,410
a

00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:47,019
reader it's not a hard and fast rule but

00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:49,630
if you can look at your document or your

00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:52,660
document set through a lens of a you

00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,579
know how many words this gets means how

00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,989
important it is and just see if there's

00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:59,200
anything was disproportionately

00:49:55,989 --> 00:50:00,819
emphasized or de-emphasized obviously

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,809
exceptions include the introduction

00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:06,039
which is typically shorter and

00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:08,319
procedural or reference material which

00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:13,180
tends to just be as long as it needs to

00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:15,460
be what you do about problems with the

00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,769
level of detail or or disparities in the

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,869
level of detail can vary sometimes you

00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:22,749
can reorganize the content or split

00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:24,549
things into two parts sometimes you'll

00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:27,430
need to make different documents with

00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:30,309
different levels of focus or sometimes

00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:32,410
you can leave it as it is taking

00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:34,660
feedback from your audience nowadays we

00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:37,059
have systems that will allow us to put

00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:40,630
comments directly on the documentation

00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:42,069
pages use those systems they are the

00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:47,380
best thing that's happened to

00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:49,119
documentation in a long time and make

00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,559
your documentation readable I got

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,640
something from our marketing department

00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,650
last week and I did it actually realize

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,289
that the flesh can carried grade level

00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:02,890
system of scoring documentation which

00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:04,960
allows us to see you know how hard it is

00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:09,249
to read a piece of documentation I had

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:14,519
assumed that it went up to 12 this was a

00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:14,519
flash kincaid reading level of 18 I

00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:22,390
could leave this I have a master secret

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,640
but really we shouldn't put our users

00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:26,799
through that not only should we not put

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,329
our users through that anybody who's

00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:30,549
throwing that into google translate

00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:32,579
because they're using our software and

00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:37,029
reading our docs in another language

00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:39,609
this can I have a hell of a time if you

00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:40,960
can if you can aim for a reading level

00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:42,489
and there's there's plenty of tests

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,400
online if you can aim for a reading

00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:48,489
level of about a fifth or sixth grade

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,829
that's great if you're up to about

00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:51,960
eighth grade that's probably fine any

00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:53,580
higher

00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:59,790
that and you're just being mean to your

00:51:53,580 --> 00:52:02,070
users don't do that don't don't create a

00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,839
wall of words either split things into

00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:07,310
paragraphs in two sections give it

00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:13,260
headings make it look nice and inviting

00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:15,180
and if you've gotten this far get input

00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,480
from other people get other people to

00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:20,339
look at it and read it what makes sense

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,589
to you and sentence constructions that

00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:25,109
look fine to you are not always as easy

00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:32,369
for for somebody who's not inside your

00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:34,589
brain and yeah visual cues so format

00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:37,800
your document so the key pieces stand

00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:43,349
out use headings even for short Doc's

00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:46,710
use headings use fonts sparingly but for

00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:51,210
emphasis and focus it's often useful to

00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:54,080
have italics bold and monospaced fonts

00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:57,420
that have a meaning so for example

00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,220
variables may be italic words that are

00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,550
defined elsewhere in your glossary are

00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,170
bold and conflict options that we're

00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:07,830
going to let you copy and paste and

00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:10,950
should be safe might be mah no space use

00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:14,730
examples use pictures for overview if

00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:16,800
that's helpful add links for related

00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,839
material and for hiding detail if you

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,820
have too much detail in a particular

00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:27,630
section link to it somewhere else if you

00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,099
have parallel ideas use lists build them

00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,630
out into a list rather than having this

00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:34,290
one long sentence with loads of

00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:37,410
semicolons tables are also great for

00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,820
that in a vertical list readers tend to

00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,040
remember about eighty percent of the

00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:44,690
material presented versus less than

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:47,760
forty percent in a paragraph list

00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:49,740
numbers versus bullets if you have to do

00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,839
it in order use numbers otherwise use

00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:55,020
bullets people can get hung up on

00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,550
numbers when they don't need to be if it

00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,890
doesn't matter it's not an ordered list

00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:02,670
it's just we have these features just

00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,830
put bullets and if you're going to refer

00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:06,680
to items

00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:09,200
it might be ok to use numbers for

00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:12,590
unordered lists but really if you're

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,060
getting above five or six items you're

00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:17,420
doing something wrong find a way to

00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:21,520
reorganize it we have five minutes left

00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,520
are there any other questions yep

00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:33,980
working with source code changes the

00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,520
source code is here is very comfortable

00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:40,430
for me the one thing that always scares

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,630
me most about running a reference

00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:46,970
documentation is I like to have serious

00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:49,490
similar experience with running really

00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:52,640
what I consider the source for the

00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:55,910
documentation and that is not just some

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,490
big HTML page where I have to do all the

00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,980
HTML tags and every thought of that now

00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:03,050
just wonder if maybe there's one or two

00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,750
Apache projects out there anywhere else

00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,220
where they've made it so that four

00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,470
people actually writing the

00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:12,380
documentation it's a very similar

00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:15,650
comfortable cut to the chase experiences

00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,720
and maybe try to source so the question

00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,610
was either project that that make

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,250
writing the documentation particularly

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:23,180
for reference documentation as

00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:27,140
comfortable and when you say comfortable

00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:33,950
I assume you mean as as I de ish as

00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:38,900
writing the code I have to say yep I

00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:42,800
currently work in in XML primarily and

00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:46,520
different flavors of XML and I have ID

00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,080
like tools that I that I can work in and

00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,870
unfortunately I'm one of those people

00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,900
who just prefers to handcraft my xml I

00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:57,110
don't know if you guys have any better

00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:00,170
suggestions yep I'm not

00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:02,360
sure you're disagreeing I think the

00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:04,940
point no okay dude does anyone have a

00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:07,490
suggestion first art well I suggest

00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,200
let's use an XML dte or whatever in

00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,180
which you don't have for a million tiny

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,010
tags in order to say things that are

00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,010
better person more abstract what

00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:21,890
markdown is a good way yeah I'm the CMS

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:32,240
the Apache CMS allows you to use

00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:35,450
markdown cns to pachi org yep stinks

00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,190
might be good if you guys cannot talk to

00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,080
each other just so that we can get it on

00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:42,410
the recording it's not that I don't want

00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:47,870
you to talk to each other but an XML DTD

00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:50,780
was also suggested anything else yeah

00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:54,920
when important thing there might be

00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:57,620
where you put the source code and where

00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:03,050
you put the documentation what I've

00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:07,580
found from HT PD vs. traffic server in

00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:11,360
HD PD we have the documentation in the

00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:14,660
source tree versus 80s where we don't

00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:19,220
and i think i'm pretty sure it's really

00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:23,020
better to have it in the tree yeah i

00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,020
think there's broad agreement with that

00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:30,470
okay any last 60 second question I will

00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:32,990
be around all weekend or week I'm pretty

00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:36,970
easy to spot so feel free to come and

00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,970
