	Building your First Connector for Kafka Connect

Apache Kafka is rapidly becoming the de-facto standard for distributed streaming architectures, and as its adoption grows the need to leverage existing data also grows. When developers need to handle certain technologies that happen to not have an connector available; they have no other choice other than write their own. But that can be quite challenging, even for experienced developers. This talk will explain in details what it takes to develop a connector, how the Kafka Connect framework works, and what are the common pitfalls that you should avoid. The code of an existing connector will be used to explain how the implementation should look like so you can develop more confidence when building your own.
