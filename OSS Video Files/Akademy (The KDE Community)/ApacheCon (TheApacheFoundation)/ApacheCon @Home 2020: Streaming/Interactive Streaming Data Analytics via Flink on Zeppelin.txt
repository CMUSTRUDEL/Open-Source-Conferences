Flink is a powerful distributed streaming engine, but it requires lots of programming skills. Even Flink supports sql, it is not an easy job for an analyst to use Flink to do streaming data analytics directly. Fortunately, another apache project Zeppelin integrates Flink and make streaming data analytics pretty easy for these data analyst without programming skillset. In this talk, I would talk about how to use Flink on Zeppelin to do interactive streaming data analytics. And how to build real time dashboard without writting any html/js code.
