Change Data Capture (CDC) has become the standard to capture and propagate committed changes from a database to downstream consumers, for example to keep multiple datastores in sync and avoid common pitfalls such as dual writes (remember? "Friends don't let friends do dual writes"). Consuming these changelogs with Apache Flink used to be a pain, but the latest release (Flink 1.11) introduced not only support for CDC, but support for CDC from the comfort of your SQL couch. In this talk, we'll demo how to use Flink SQL to easily process database changelog data generated with Debezium. About the speaker(s):
