The use of distributed streaming platforms is becoming increasingly popular among developers, but have you ever wonder what exactly this is? Part Pub/Sub messaging system, partly distributed storage, partly event processing engine, the usage of this type of technology brings a whole new perspective on how developers capture, store, and process events. This talk will explain what distributed streaming platforms are and how it can be a game changer for modern data architectures. It will be discussed the road in IT that led to the need of this type of plataform, the current state of Apache Kafka, as well as scenarios where this technology can be implemented.
