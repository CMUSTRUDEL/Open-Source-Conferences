There is often data locked in transactional relational systems that you would like to ingest, transform, parse, aggregate, and store forever in Hadoop as wide tables. With the new features in Apache NiFi, Cloudera Schema Registry, HBase 2, Phoenix, Hive 3, Kudu, Spark 2, Kafka, Ranger, Atlas, Zeppelin and Hue this becomes something you can do at scale without the heavy hand processing of yore. Now with the hybrid cloud, you may want to securely ingest to multiple clusters with new tools including Streams Replication Manager. They told me it's not ETL or ELT, exactly it is so much more. You now have full control over global data assets with full management, full control and smart dashboards to allow a true enterprise open source solution for all your data. With materialized views and the ability to federate queries to JDBC and other data sources your fully ACID Hive 3 tables allow for you to escape the small scale EDW and be reborn in unlimited scale data worlds.
