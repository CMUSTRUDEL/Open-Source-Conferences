00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,370
bleed which came out on monday and was a

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,269
really lovely birthday gift to me so

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,550
this is what really here to talk about

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,570
this is the the commit and I'm guessing

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,219
from the back of the room you probably

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,640
can't see this very clearly but this is

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,020
this is the actual commit which brought

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:29,699
the bug into a system i don't think i

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:32,550
can zoom in sorry he talked to the media

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,899
for the first time on wednesday and he's

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,850
like so if you look it was like it's

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,129
just a few hours before midnight on New

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,809
Year's Eve so he checked in this big

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,219
amount of code and it got you can see

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,989
someone else down here actually it was

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,940
reviewed by somebody but they still

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,260
didn't catch it so yeah so talks to the

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,379
media and he said like it's you know

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,090
look I I did this as a mistake someone

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,110
this wasn't like part of the NSA we

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,660
weren't trying to like sneak something

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:03,210
in he's this guy in Germany and but a

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:06,060
sub hmm he supposedly is coming out

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,460
clean yeah so this act this is a really

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,330
big commit so I didn't actually track

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,850

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,619
