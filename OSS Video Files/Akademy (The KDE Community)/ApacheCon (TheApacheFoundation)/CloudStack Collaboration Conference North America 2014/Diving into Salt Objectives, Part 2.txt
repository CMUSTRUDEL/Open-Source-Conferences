so a quick little recap on what we what

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,320
we talked about in the last section this

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,380
wow this image really needs to be

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,869
updated if you can read that you don't

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:27,240
need glasses but so you invoke solve the

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,580
target the function and then you pass

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,920
arguments to it and the arguments can be

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,270
key value arguments if you may have

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,390
noticed one did when I did the package

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:41,399
dot install command earlier with openssl

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,440
i passed refresh equals true so there is

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,719
a lot of flexibility with this structure

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,079
of running the cell command but frankly

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,590
it's not too terribly complicated now I

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,600
want to talk about a couple of really

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,510
briefly and very quickly talk about a

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,800
few high-level salt routines just so

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,059
that you're aware of them to give you a

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,550
little context of some of the things

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,650
we're going to talk about so solid ships

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,650
the salt minion ships with the command

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,119
called salt call so the salt command is

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,130
reaching out over the network and

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,799
telling remote systems hey we're on

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,740
these routines well what if we want to

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,180
run those same routines on the minion

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,150
itself instead of remote executing them

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:31,939
this is where song call comes into play

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:31,939
so let me demonstrate how that works

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,680
fire up my master and my minion here you

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:45,000
don't actually need a magistrate minion

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:46,649
to use salts call okay but the song call

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,299
works just like the song command but

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:55,860
there's no target to specify because

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:57,600
we're running things locally okay so

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,030
pretty simple and straightforward I

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,759
think all of those functions that you've

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:08,209
got you can execute locally and I do

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:14,140
have some people who go so far as to

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:20,320
never learn systemd because they just do

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,320
