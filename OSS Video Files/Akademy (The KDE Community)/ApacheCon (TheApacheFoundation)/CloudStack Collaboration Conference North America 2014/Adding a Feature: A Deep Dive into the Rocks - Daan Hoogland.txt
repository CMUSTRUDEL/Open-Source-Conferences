what I'm going to talk about is myself

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:11,160
Community Development a technical

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,540
problem that I had at hand and the

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,529
lessons that I should have learned from

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,500
it and I called it a deep dive in the

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,630
rocks well not sure if it's appropriate

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:29,279
but I am down Oakland I work at sugar

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:34,430
fish for a year and seven months I don't

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:40,440
know why I put 1.8 but seems alright I

00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:43,590
am a tried lead a coach juror this is

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,629
some information about me the twitter

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,840
handle is not my twitter handle i found

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:55,320
out i don't use it it's actually my

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:58,859
skype so google+ is useful for me mostly

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,280
and these are this is the greatest race

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:06,930
I ever did it's in Norway and I'll talk

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:11,250
to you about it offline some advice this

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,189
talk is mainly about community I'm gonna

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,280
talk about some technical issues

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:21,360
slightly but that's not the point of the

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,680
talk it's mainly interested -

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,950
interesting - to start us at people who

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,170
want to contribute or not used to

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,030
contributing to of source like I wasn't

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:43,710
it might be interesting for the for the

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:50,189
gurus I'm not sure so how to get

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:51,930
involved I started out a to bear a year

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,759
and seven months ago but I started out

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,610
at CloudStack just under a year ago I

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:05,159
have some other responsibilities and I

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,220
got a assignment to work on I was

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,380
working with Nicole one of the what I

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:17,440
consider the Guru

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:26,800
so I had to be at a certain standard to

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:31,840
to get accepted and and to sorry my

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,690
English is failing here to be recognized

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,390
as as someone that could actually

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:43,030
contribute what I try what I'm trying to

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,920
say today is that having yourself

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,770
accepted in a community is quite similar

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,630
to having your patch accepted by a big

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:57,820
open source project and hopefully I'll

00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:01,900
show that adequately and I'll show you

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:08,040
what pitfalls you have and what not to

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:11,110
do and to how to become the outsider

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,489
well one thing is pick a great

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:19,930
refactoring job and do it all at once

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:24,730
don't hesitate to grab have a grab at

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,550
all the sides of the system and well I

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:33,459
see some recognizing laughs there so we

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:35,920
all know what can happen it's quite

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,620
similar to coming into a group and

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,930
saying well I am the expert I can tell

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,930
you what to do and how to do it

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,049
this here is line which is hardly

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,959
readable I can show you right here

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:59,590
there's a six digit number that's the

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:03,970
size of the patch that I contributed as

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:08,500
my first major patch and I kind of

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:12,880
regret that I managed to split out some

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:17,109
parts but it was quite hard to the two

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,289
that do that and I should have been

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:22,270
going at it totally differently there

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,740
were some troubles with that there were

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:32,350
some reasons that I could

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:35,440
I'll get into that this is I said about

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,780
the size this patch I had to port

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,010
backwards or forwards through the system

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:45,150
through the branches initially I made a

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:50,080
patch on the four one one branch of

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:54,370
which we had a custom implementation at

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,670
our site then I had to port it to master

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,950
which at that time was still for two but

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,230
I wasn't in it wasn't accepted in time

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,290
so I had to port it back to our custom

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,080
version of four to first four to zero

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,410
than four to one and then finally I got

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,740
it and it's now in for three happily

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,200
sitting there waiting to be used by all

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,260
of us I don't think there's any other

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:32,700
users than Schubert by the way at this

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:35,200
moment so how how do you contribute I

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,380
made a little list and I put code in

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:47,820
there a lot but that's of course not all

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:50,530
of it and it is what has to be accepted

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:55,690
it's not how you get yourself accepted

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:58,000
my way by just submitting code and get

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,940
it refueled you'll have to talk a lot of

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,030
people about your call code so these are

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,790
the other things that are very important

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:11,050
mill about what you're gonna do mail at

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:13,330
several levels I'm gonna do this in the

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:20,110
far future but now I want to do this to

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:22,870
make it possible there's an refuel board

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,800
that we use at Apache it's not ideal

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,140
it's a it's a slow process you need to

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,740
make your patch available at the review

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,740
board you need to then contact people

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,920
there's a lot of hassle around it a lot

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,610
of people at Citrix they like to have

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,970
JIRA tickets and maybe rightfully so so

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,920
that's another bunch of things you need

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:56,240
to do before you get your code accepted

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:57,830
and do them by the way it's easier for

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,320
yourself to keep track and it's also

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,620
easier for others to to know what you're

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,140
working on to know how not how to

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,610
prevent double work because that's

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,830
another thing that might happen of

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,280
course if you if you go into a room and

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,980
I see it happened at as we speak people

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,320
are at their company they're making a

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,590
nice feature and they're hardly

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,570
communicating about it is hard to keep

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,520
track about who is working on what and

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,010
you want to make sure that people talk

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,810
to each other so that they are not

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,360
making conflicting things and they're

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,360
not doing the same thing over so

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,660
Schubert

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:46,970
they had a trick with cloud SEC for

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,920
Schubert Hughes's Neisseria Software

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:54,290
Defined Networking

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I think it's MVP FEMA MVP nowadays this

00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:01,700
is how they did it in cloud SEC these

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,710
are several free pcs that you see there

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,660
belong to one customer there for

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:13,400
instance different stages in and out up

00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:17,090
street detail sweetest English and they

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,280
need to be connected the only way to do

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,540
this fire the private gateways if you

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,700
don't want to go through the public

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,610
network is to connect them on fee lands

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:33,310
have the feelings then hacked on the

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:37,550
hypervisor into a I'll switch at nasira

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:40,910
identifier for the network connect the l

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:46,730
switches to a virtual router that you

00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:47,339
deployed separately have the routing to

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,819
all the

00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:53,910
networks back on that virtual router and

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:56,550
you need to manage that lot of work so

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,249
rightfully people wanted to work wanted

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:04,879
this hacked into something more usable

00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:13,319
and they so requested this is sales

00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:16,170
sorry so the question is make sure that

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:19,139
that wheelhouse code is being leveraged

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,980
for these private gateways so that we

00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:27,079
can easily provision are our gateways

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:33,829
from FePc to free PC for a customer and

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:33,829
that's what I hacked at for a long Wow

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:43,220
so this is how it should look

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,220
once done

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:57,960
next time I'm not gonna use this format

00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:02,550
it's not very this is a happy acid boss

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:09,250
for creating a PPC private gateway

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:11,830
that's a that's all those data that you

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,500
need to create one is in there except

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,930
that it will only work with feelings and

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:23,440
not as you can see as I try to do there

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:26,020
with an L switch so I changed the RP to

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,670
accept the I'll switch but then I found

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:34,090
that there were some things in the

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:39,370
system that wouldn't allow me to one

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:42,940
thing is that the villa and the feelin

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:47,770
ID are all over this network part of the

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:52,060
system so that's how I got to touch over

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:55,630
fifty files with little changes here and

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,570
there parsing and integer from a string

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:06,520
and doing nothing else on the other hand

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:10,900
accepting maybe a URL and in the new

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:14,410
code of course accepting a URI which had

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,350
a slightly different format the URL

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:21,580
would be as you see at the bottom vielen

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:24,370
colon slash slash some villain ID but it

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:29,910
would be completely equal for the logic

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,910
in the system to just the ill feelin ID

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:39,610
so the question was and i have chosen

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:44,080
for the innum solution and i think we

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:47,280
need to change that in the future how

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,110
are you gonna distinct between the two

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,460
what is now in the system is an enum

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:57,580
which specifies which type of isolation

00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,209
method you use and this feelin needs to

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,560
be edited edited the dish this sorry

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,470
this enum needs to be

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,560
edited in the core of the system for any

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:12,190
network plug-in that is added hence

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,260
making the word plug-in maybe little

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:21,100
overstated I went for the enum type but

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:34,779
but as I said the code needs revisiting

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:40,600
this I shouldn't have in there this is a

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:44,770
problem because the if you look at a

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,820
different broadcast or as isolation

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:52,600
types that we have they have completely

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,630
different formats so I made a lot of

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,900
backwards into battle compatible changes

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,510
for which I only found out after for

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,650
instance Elena from Citrix complained to

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:11,890
me hey refer to code because it's not

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:14,050
good in the end while the code was

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,490
working by the way in our site and

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:21,960
functioning bradley i started hacking at

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:25,030
this enum to make sure that all

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,180
broadcaster eyes would be backwards

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:32,020
compatible and i submitted that patch

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:38,260
and it was accepted and it was great and

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:41,790
it was very small and I well I'll get to

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,790
the conclusion of that later

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:59,910
there's a bunch of Sen types and they

00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:02,549
were added over the past year mostly the

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,069
I think nasira was a year and a half ago

00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:08,459
but after that came me donate and now

00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:11,850
this VX land this open-face which all of

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:15,089
them are in this innum and there's they

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:18,480
are recognized by the by their

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:23,160
individual identifier and this

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:26,369
identifier this enum has has a bunch of

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:31,110
functions to do the parsing or do the

00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:39,509
generating of the of the URI belonging

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:41,459
to that type of isolation type so this

00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:45,329
was this was actually one thing that I

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:49,139
could easily have done separately but

00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:53,189
the use of it couldn't throughout the

00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:57,779
system there is vielen vielen ID fill on

00:14:53,189 --> 00:15:01,579
number fill on URI broadcast domain you

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:05,489
or I both broadcast domain ID and

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:10,769
there's also isolation type isolation ID

00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:13,319
and somehow these are somewhat different

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,389
but I don't know the difference and I

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:18,209
think we should get rid of them unless

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:22,499
someone knows what the difference is and

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:27,089
can explain it and we can hack them back

00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:30,329
into the proper way so that at certain

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:34,139
points a feel on broadcast URI is no

00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:37,919
longer assigned to an isolation tribe it

00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:45,329
happens in the system a lot of what I

00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:49,279
did was actually dis I decided that it

00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:53,100
was not a good idea to have get VLAN ID

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,309
for other types of broadcast domain type

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,470
so a lot of the 300k change that i

00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:01,730
submitted was

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:06,990
just changing names and these names were

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:08,790
all over the system and actually the

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,920
changing of this name should have been a

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,750
separate patch I didn't do that but I

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,510
now know it should have been a separate

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:22,590
patch right this one I told you about

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:26,160
here is the code it's hard to read that

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:29,550
what it actually said is set isolation

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,690
type you or I and said broadcast type

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:38,450
you or I and both are set to the parsing

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:45,680
of IP don't get broadcast domain URI and

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:51,480
then to URI for the type isolation type

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:55,950
dot feel on well this code needs

00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:01,170
revisiting as I told you but I didn't

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:04,290
get around that another part what I did

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:09,060
a lot at a lot of places is replacing

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:13,200
this parsing of a long from something

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,360
that is a string but assumptions were

00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,360
made that this string would only contain

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,920
the ID and other places assumptions

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,470
would be made that this string would be

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:28,290
of the form fill on colon slash slash

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:35,040
etc and it was hard to find the people

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:38,250
who knew and who knew why so there are

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:45,120
some things to do as I explained which

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:47,930
are not the essence of this talk as

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,930
they're shown here

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:59,690
my conclusions and now I've got a

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,190
slighted it's nice but I don't know why

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,140
I put it in there not well actually I

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,420
think I show here that some other guys

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:13,190
then done how on that sugar phillies.com

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:17,300
works on it and that's me dumb but it's

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:20,059
just a funny slide so you can introduce

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,590
yourself and as as I said with one big

00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,600
thing in one go

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:28,240
and I know there are other people who

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,240
did that I won't mention your name Mike

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,360
actually Mike and I had to have the same

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:39,710
experience we did a lot of work on one

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,320
big issue and by the time we finally got

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,760
to the states that a real few woods

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,620
would be accepted we were both committed

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,490
and we wouldn't actually need it anymore

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,250
but the review is useful anyhow so I

00:18:51,490 --> 00:19:01,130
still like to reef submit my code for

00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:03,230
review at least if it's bigger than just

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:07,309
changing the way an exception is caught

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:15,860
or whatever small things you can think

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:19,280
of as I said you need to talk about what

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:24,350
you're gonna do a lot and Citrix coated

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,690
making FS in this case it's hardly

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,570
functional I mean the functional change

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,610
that are made is tiny it's really

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,400
nothing there's a there's a feature

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,800
called a private gateway it's there you

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,260
can plug it to networks it's there

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,020
there's nasira networks there were there

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,540
I just need to plug this Monsieur and

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,059
network that's the whole functional

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,360
specification but the functional

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,980
specification is useful also for

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,750
discussion about technical implications

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,750
about it so use it

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:11,490
now what we don't have at Apache at the

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,910
moment what we don't have at classic at

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,380
the moment is a convenient way for

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,360
contributors and we need to work on that

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,590
and we are working on it actually

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,650
Sabathia changed the process for the

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,080
documentation in a very very convenient

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,330
way but we need to make this more

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,510
convenient so that someone who is not a

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:39,240
committer and I think I recognize people

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:41,520
from SunGard at least they used to have

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,790
a very important committee he just

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,890
resigned as VP but nowadays they're

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:50,820
working a lot on on cloud stack and they

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:53,280
don't have any representative in the

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,310
community other than through the mailing

00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,750
list so for them it would be very useful

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:04,470
to have a gator pool mechanism in which

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:08,610
they can can easily demonstrate a code

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:12,060
and we are thinking about it and we are

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,950
talking about it both mark and I work so

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,680
hard to mark patches that we're now in

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:22,590
the PMC and we will talk about these

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:24,780
issues of course there's other ways and

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:28,080
get up - Harriet and maybe we can

00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,630
improve on the review board but for now

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,300
we'll have to do with it so I talked

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,550
about introducing yourself in a

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:39,180
community and introducing your patch in

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:42,930
a community so I need to tell you in

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:47,610
what way I think they're similar what

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:52,530
what what did I think about what I did

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:54,120
and what I delivered well if you are a

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:58,110
person and you want to introduce

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,330
yourself to a community you want to show

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,760
that you can do something and do it

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,980
right and then when you're done you go

00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,750
on to the next thing and you don't say I

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,110
can do it all and then do a lot of

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,690
things have it happens

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,180
same for patch you you try to cut it in

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,210
little

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,940
Jesus explain what it's for and and get

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,970
it into the community get it accepted

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,780
and in that way you grow towards the end

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:30,540
goal of the big feature even though it's

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:34,060
a tiny functional feature that some some

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,370
thing I don't think I wrote there that's

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,280
if you're in a company with other people

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:42,040
in the community you have a layered

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,690
community around you try to reach out to

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,800
the bigger community try to be as much

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,770
communicating with the people outside

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,900
your community community your smaller

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,970
community as you can don't stay in the

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,130
company don't ask too many questions in

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,470
the company and if you do try to ask

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,800
questions in your company on the public

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:05,260
mailing list because however stupid they

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:12,190
may seem there they might be useful to

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:15,370
others communicate both the intermediate

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,920
goal and the end goal I kind of put it

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:22,750
like be true to your ideals but be

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:27,480
pragmatic about them you have to be able

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:30,220
to have an have an end fashion but but

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,130
still do the practical work that you

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:39,610
need to do now and not try to do reach

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:42,850
your rank or goal today if you do a

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,920
proposal on the mailing list well the

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:49,090
first free post that I did on the

00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,060
mailing list I got no answer and that

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,890
doesn't mean that people don't want your

00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,740
proposal it doesn't mean that it's bad

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,450
it could mean that it's bad that it

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,720
actually only means that people don't

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:05,610
answer they don't have the time and they

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,260
might actually think that it's good and

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:11,740
well if I applied it to a human being

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,740
you're welcome I am welcome I didn't

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:19,260
always feel welcome and I was wrong not

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,260
feeling welcome I know that now

00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:26,140
don't break other code be backwards

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,059
compatible and as the human variety to

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,789
that you

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,529
right and that doesn't mean that others

00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:37,379
are wrong

00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:42,330
however right you are I think I have

00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:43,950
five minutes but I forgot a lot one

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,230
thing to say you can put questions

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,570
intermediate and I don't have a slide

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,570
that says question mark or questions and

00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:56,940
that's it

00:24:53,659 --> 00:25:00,049
are there any questions even though you

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,049
forgot to pose them

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:29,230
yes I have considered that the question

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,570
is when you implemented this for the

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:35,230
Nigerian networks did you consider

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:38,499
making it more generic so that other Sdn

00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:42,309
implementations might be used I have

00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:44,019
considered it and I've taken it into

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:51,340
account in my design but I haven't

00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:56,740
implemented it it can be adjusted to

00:25:51,340 --> 00:26:02,110
suit more types of SD we need work for

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:05,019
that but yeah I have actually talked

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,980
about it as well a bit but the response

00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:08,289
wasn't very big

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:12,669
I don't think anybody but Schubert uses

00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:15,970
this feature by the way and I talked to

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:19,480
say it I met yesterday is implementing a

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,820
UI for a feature that he made because he

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,610
said otherwise nobody's going to use it

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,279
now my primary objective is not to make

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,110
everybody use it but I'll need to do

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:34,320
something like that if it's going to be

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,320
small generic and use by others

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,000
no one else

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,260
