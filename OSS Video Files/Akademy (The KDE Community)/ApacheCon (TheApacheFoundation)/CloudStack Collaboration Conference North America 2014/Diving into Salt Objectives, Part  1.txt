sorry we're starting a little late I

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,960
appreciate everybody's patience my

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:16,350
flight got delayed this morning and that

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:21,510
never happens right all right but who

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,130
here is familiar with salt so I'm okay

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,570
who's heard of salt let me start earlier

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:32,120
okay excellent so who here has installed

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:35,670
salt before and used it a little bit

00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:42,350
okay good who here has deployed salt and

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,350
in in a non production environment

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:51,260
production environment all right I know

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:54,780
where to start then excellent okay

00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,230
Sebastian you said four hours so that

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,879
means that I've got you guys to one I

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,739
thought it was three hours but it's okay

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,449
i've actually got four days of content

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,450
that I brought with me so we should be

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,299
fine regardless what I'm going to be

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,380
doing for this tutorial is that

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,030
saltstack has three training courses

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,340
that we that we give out and so I'm

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,500
going to be navigating through the early

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,750
introduction components of the first

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,119
training that will go through

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,460
installation high level of what salt is

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,189
and then move into the remote execution

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,829
components of salt and then followed

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,780
that up with a deeper dive into

00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:36,060
configuration management and then if we

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,409
have time I'm going to be walking

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:43,259
through the cloud stack states that are

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,899
available up on our formulas repository

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:52,130
on github okay but that should hopefully

00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:57,590
address the needs of the audience well

00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:01,020
now really quickly a few things to

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,119
introduce myself quickly Sebastian said

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,700
it well but I'm the guy who started

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,380
writing songs stack I'm always thrilled

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,509
to give tutorials and talks I don't get

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,870
to as much anymore because I'm too busy

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,090
running a company

00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:17,500
but but this is a lot of fun so I am

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,500
