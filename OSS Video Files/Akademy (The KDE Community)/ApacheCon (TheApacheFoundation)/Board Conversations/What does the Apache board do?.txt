hi I'm rich Balan I'm Shankar crew we

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,120
are at the moment of this recording

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,650
we're both members of the board of

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,280
directors of the Apache Software

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,830
Foundation now people that have been

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,330
involved in open-source even folks that

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,550
have been around open-source for a long

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,680
time

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,710
tend to look at Apache as having all of

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,390
this structure and it's not well

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,740
understood why we have all this

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,420
structure and there's a number of

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,910
reasons for that and we'll get into that

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,210
in some of these later videos but a

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,110
question that comes up quite frequently

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,149
is what does the board of directors of

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,539
the Apache Software Foundation actually

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:50,239
do so there are nine of us and our

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,879
responsibility is to govern the

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,680
operations of the of the foundation now

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,780
this doesn't mean getting involved in

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,780
the individual software projects

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,820
software projects themselves are

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,010
self-regulating self-governing they set

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,130
their own direction and the board does

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,010
not tinker in those decisions but what

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:15,770
we're responsible for is the legal

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:19,229
entity of the foundation this includes

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:23,430
everything from finances to legal

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,710
affairs to marketing but once again

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,890
doesn't touch the technical decisions of

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,759
the individual project the board of

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,369
directors meets once a month and at

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,320
those meetings we are presented with

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,880
reports from the individual projects now

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,360
that may seem to fly in the face of what

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,950
I just said but these reports are not

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,450
generally speaking about individual

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,549
technical decisions that are being made

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,590
but rather about how the projects are

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,840
running in ways that are sustaining

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,869
sustainability of our projects is a

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,820
primary goal of the foundation that's

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,840
why I think I can help explain one of

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,880
the things there is when we say mmm

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,680
projects often I think people are

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,450
thinking about oh you know I've

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,670
downloaded Lucene and the software does

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,010
great stuff how do I configure X

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,900
that's the product that's a software

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,640
product that you're using which is the

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,280
reason catches here is to make software

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,260
that's useful that's what we do but from

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,990
our perspective a project is the

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,930
community around that software and the

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,459
process by which that community is

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,800
making improvements is hopefully getting

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,280
together to have a roadmap for a great

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,040
new version so Apache strength is

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,470
helping to find helping to mentor

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,470
communities to be self-governing and to

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,100
be open to new contributors over the

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,989
long haul

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,700
even when you know perhaps companies may

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,310
go it's a place it's a different

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,400
direction or the technology may be more

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,709
or less important in daily date day to

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,019
day life we try to help the communities

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,380
continue developing the software or at

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,640
least maintaining it so that's the side

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,920
that the board is looking at in the

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,900
reports really is this that the

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,269
community managed to themselves as a

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,100
whole project as a whole you know sort

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,450
of you could say a division of a

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,049
software corporation you know this

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,840
division makes this software that they

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,180
sell are they doing a good job of you

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,239
know addressing bugs and coming up with

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,500
new features and you know making sure

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,030
the documentation is working for the new

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,150
release things like that oh very good

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,880
so our monthly board meetings have

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,730
broadly speaking two parts in the first

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,290
part of the meeting we look at reports

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,260
from the various officers of the

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:48,019
foundation and these are things such as

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,930
security legal marketing Events

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:56,310
Management and and these are about how

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:59,100
the foundation as a legal entity is

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,600
operating in the second half of the

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,350
meeting as I mentioned we look at these

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,140
project reports we have at the moment

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,370
around 200 top level projects and they

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,989
report quarterly so as you have already

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,859
figured out that means that we have to

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:21,970
read 50 to 60 reports each month

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:24,729
and these reports range from a few lines

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,099
to many pages depending on what's been

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:29,409
going on in the project when you read a

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:32,469
project report what are the top things

00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:34,930
that you're looking for about the health

00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:38,289
of this project yeah so as a as a

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,590
director I'm looking is is the community

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:43,030
operating well are they welcoming new

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,289
contributors because that's the way to

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,479
keep your project going have they you

00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:51,909
know if they're an active project who's

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,889
creating new development how they does

00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:55,629
the report described in in a little bit

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,310
of deep not detailed but a high level

00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,129
you know what kinds of things are they

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,259
doing is it new features is it cleaning

00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:05,830
up old bugs just to get a sense of it

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:07,900
and quite frankly for me one of the

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,560
things that I look at is if they talk

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,360
about events that they're working at or

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,409
toxic they've given are they talking

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,779
about them from the community

00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,779
perspective or are they talking about

00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,129
them as sometimes happens from their

00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,779
corporate perspective so many of our

00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,580
committers on projects are also

00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,930
employees of big software companies that

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,569
of course use the software and that's

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,789
great but sometimes they get very

00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,279
excited with their team at their company

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,889
and you know they have an event that

00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,610
their company runs about the Apache

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:41,229
project and which is great which is

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,610
which is great when that happens but we

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,620
want to make sure that that attendees

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,110
understand it's an Apache project that a

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,639
bunch of different people work on so one

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,990
of the things I look for is how the

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,270
project is branding themselves and

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,879
expressing that in their reports one of

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,039
the top things that I look for is as

00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:05,349
Shane mentioned that the project is

00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:07,449
welcoming new contributors some projects

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:11,379
have a very high barrier to entry for

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:13,479
new contributors and we as the board

00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,909
encourage them to lower that bar to

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,819
entry I've been known to say that we

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,289
should hand out competitor bits like

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,539
candy

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,400
we have revision control so that if

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,990
people make mistakes you can revert that

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,060
and welcoming a new contributor to early

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,860
your risk there is that they'll make a

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,480
mistake

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,400
welcoming them too late your risk is

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,000
that they'll go away and never come back

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,590
which to me is a much larger risk so we

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,660
continually encourage projects to

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,840
welcome new members and when a project

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,240
has not had any new contributors added

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,760
any new committers added within a year

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,730
or so we start asking why we start

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,430
asking whether there's simply nobody out

00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,800
there or if they're being too stringent

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,450
in their requirements that's actually

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,940
one of the things from from reports

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,070
there's project reports usually usually

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,840
there's not a standard form but we do

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,580
sort of ask you know please cover these

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,260
areas they often describe a little bit

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,150
what's happening they have a section

00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,800
that's issues for the board I think it's

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,720
important one to mention so if a project

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,580
has a question for the board if they've

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,670
had an issue or if they have you know we

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,580
want to do X is that okay at Apache in

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,410
terms of a legal or branding perspective

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,150
and there's also a section in reports

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,280
where they can say when we're so last

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,440
release or their software and when have

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,690
they added contributors or PMC members

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,910
so that shows is their velocity of

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,310
project is it the project still making

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,710
releases for fixes because that's

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,470
important for users the PMC is the

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:48,280
project management committee and this is

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:51,340
a group of individuals that that vote on

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,590
releases and make other top-level

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,050
decisions about the project in some

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,180
projects this is exactly the same group

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,460
as the committers and other projects

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,960
those two things are made separate just

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,450
depending on the preferences of the

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,970
individual project community and I think

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,220
sometimes depending on the scope of the

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,750
project so some projects are it's a

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,910
pretty obvious thing you're working on

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,590
everybody's code would would interact

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,720
with each other so there they probably

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,730
would be the same if commuters in PMC

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,800
like the direction of the project is the

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:24,010
direction of everybody's code and some

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,960
projects are larger or there are systems

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,820
that plug in together and they are often

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,560
it's you know you'll make somebody a

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,540
committer in some of the plugins or some

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,690
of the specific areas so they they can

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,789
control their module but don't yet have

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,310
a say on the project direction when you

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,900
release and on whether or not you you

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,490
add new committers for the whole project

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,710
let's the other thing that project

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:48,370
management committee does is vote on new
