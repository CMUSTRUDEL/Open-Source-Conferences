the Apache Software Foundation is a

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,010
member based organization and there's

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,049
sometimes some confusion as to what that

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,120
means we recently elected role start

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,980
going on

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:21,930
we recently elected a bunch of new

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,400
members and when they came in there were

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,449
some questions as to what their

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,670
responsibilities were at the foundation

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,250
how long have you been a member since

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,660
2002 I think just a little bit longer

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,570
than us I was elected in 2003 yeah and

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,790
that's 2018 now by the way and I was

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,399
actually present for the members meeting

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,590
in which I was elected back in those

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,050
days we we did members meetings in

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,500
person sometimes so that was kind of

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,850
cool that was in Las Vegas at Apache Con

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,050
so what what's your take on the

00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,910
responsibilities of being an Apache

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,850
member responsibilities of being an

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,030
Apache member well let's just start with

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,189
very minimalist level responsibilities

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,310
that in my perspective if you're a

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,110
member in one way it's like being a

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,009
shareholder for corporation so the

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,070
shares aren't aren't worth anything but

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,810
well they aren't financially we they're

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,700
not like I'd share it publicly created a

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,970
couple corporation but they do mean that

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,130
you get to vote for the board much like

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,960
in a public corporation if you own stock

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,100
they send you this big form of a year

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,960
and they ask you if you know please vote

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,060
for these directors but at Apache that's

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,400
really your responsibility is to vote

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,520
for the board and if the board puts

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,430
forth any membership why ballot like we

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,689
wanted to change something about Apache

00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,250
fundamentally then that would be

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,159
something the members would have a say

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,840
in it would have a vote on obviously we

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,110
we need to keep confidential information

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,240
confidential so we do have access to all

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,219
the all of our projects you know sort of

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,950
private lives so to speak as well as

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,479
financial data about you know how the

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,819
internals of the algorithm is how nation

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,229
operates so we need to make sure we keep

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,520
those confidential and with

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,569
the corporation like any other

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,420
corporation really of a members also

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,760
select other members members are

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,580
responsible for nominating and then

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,540
voting on new members for the foundation

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,920
and that happens it has to happen at

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,030
least once a year we have to have a

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,800
members medium in in past years it has

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,690
happened more than once a year but we

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
haven't done that for a long time

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,060
it's as we grow it's harder to get

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,730
enough people together since a members

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,590
meeting in some ways we sort of feel

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,890
like it's a group of friends too getting

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,930
together or you know a really coherent

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,760
open source group getting together to

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,470
make decisions which it is on the other

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,780
hand our members annual members meeting

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,269
I watch must be held at least every 13

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,430
months by Delaware law because that is

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,319
our official shareholders meeting for

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,720
the corporation so you know we don't

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,299
usually think about it but the the legal

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,819
reasons behind this are part of how the

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:15,810
ASF stays a healthy corporation in

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:19,079
Delaware not to work there and keeps our

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,760
501 C 3 charity status with the IRS in

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,209
the US which is of course very important

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,430
to us as Jane mentioned members also

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,549
have access to several internal mailing

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,530
lists that the general public does not

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,840
have access to and that includes the

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,780
members mailing lists and the board

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,549
mailing lists these two lists are where

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,060
much of the business of the foundation

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,340
is conducted the board discusses issues

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,760
on the board list the membership all has

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,060
a say on whatever things whatever issues

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,319
come up on more members list our D board

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:58,319
list yeah so I let's go back for a

00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,459
second you said the the the operations

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,260
of the foundation of the business of the

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,900
foundation happened on these lists so

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,560
that's a little bit confusing if you're

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,150
not involved so when you think of the

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,889
operations of Apache you're probably

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,480
thinking of the projects you work on or

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,980
the project you use what's their roadmap

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,079
you know when are they gonna release

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,090
have they fixed your bug that has

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,180
nothing to do with what we're talking

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,319
about here so Apache is several things

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,150
it's many many projects of

00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,389
more than you've realized there 200 out

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,930
there and is the legal corporation

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:33,280
behind the scenes so this the business

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,500
of the corporation making sure that we

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,560
pay our bills making sure that we are

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,930
infrastructure staffers you know have a

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,300
boss who's also an Apache member they

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,310
get paid they make sure the servers that

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,979
we have all around the world are running

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,009
that are you know marketing publicity

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:53,319
officer works with the press which have

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,789
questions an everyday things like that

00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,340
are what the operations of the

00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:59,409
foundation are it's it's the support

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,199
mechanism that allow us to provide a

00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,130
home for all of our projects so that's

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,569
the kind of things we're talking about

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,960
so what was that what was the end of the

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,159
question there have forgotten already

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,630
well it was both of those things the

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,159
rights and the responsibilities of

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,720
members and I think that we've covered

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:16,240
both of those there is one final

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,030
confusion that comes up quite often and

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,729
one this is the distinction between

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,069
being a committer and being a member now

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,289
we've had members pretty much every year

00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,780
when we elect members one of the

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:31,240
nominees says well I've been a member

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,310
for some time I'm a committer on socials

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,909
on your project

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,830
the foundation has several tiers of

00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:42,039
participation from the users of the

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,659
software the next level up is committers

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,940
then this is where you actually have the

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,520
right to change lines of code or

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,919
documentation within the software itself

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,050
no well it's not be there I think

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,639
there's another level that's important

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,610
to talk about which is we have users of

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,349
our software who go and download it some

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,060
of them don't even care about it they're

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,380
like oh great it works okay thanks

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,389
whatever

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,669
some of them either want to get involved

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,409
or have maybe have a bug or their the

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,969
documentation is not clear who take the

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,729
next step to become a contributor right

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,080
so there are thousands and thousands of

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,360
thousands of people who have come and

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,759
submitted useful bugs maybe with a patch

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,380
or have said you know hey here's how you

00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,930
can fix your documentation or translate

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,360
the documentation so they've contributed

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,550
work which hopefully our projects have

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,460
then said hey that's great or we'll take

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,870
it if we can fix this but they don't

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,279
necessarily have a say in the project

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,500
other than the fact they they can

00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,270
contribute work which will will take

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,180
so a contributor is in the next step to

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,000
a committer which is as Richard saying

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,800
the project will formally interleave

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,450
vote to say yes this person's been a

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,040
great contributor we want them to be

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,910
committed to have a say to have a vote

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:55,860
in what this project does technically

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:59,320
and often when people are elected as a

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,970
committed to a project they make the

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,040
mental connection to an Apache member in

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,210
a conversation last night somebody who

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,490
deserved that a member is somebody who

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,640
has taken the next step to contribute to

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:18,630
the foundation as a whole and the

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,570
membership recognizes that person as

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,790
being part of the foundation at a higher

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,850
level than being just a member of an

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:32,110
individual project yeah I think there's

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:34,270
there's two parts to that one is is some

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,669
this committer who's been elected to

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,340
drive the direction of this project is

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:43,120
put in code or documentation or you know

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,919
that the cues on the user list have they

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,419
also worked with other Apache projects

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,100
so we have almost 200 200 projects many

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,830
of them very large projects are used

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,240
everywhere

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,590
now is this somebody who's interested in

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,570
the rest of Apache excuse me

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,580
interested in our open source presents

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,600
as a whole or are they simply trying to

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,160
get some something doing with that

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,140
project and that's part of what Apaches

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,590
about is we support all of our projects

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:15,100
so I hope we've given more clarity than

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,229
confusion there thanks for watching and

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,030
we'll be having more conversations like

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,419
this with various board members over the

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,710
coming months describing various aspects

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:27,690
of how the Apache Software Foundation

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,690
