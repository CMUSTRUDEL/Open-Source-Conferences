Publication date: 2019-07-08
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	You name it, we've seen it. Each unique bike lane obstruction offers unique problems as well as opportunities to resolve them. While blocked bike lanes are a seemingly unsolvable problem, Bike Lane Uprising has accepted the challenge. Come learn how our guerrilla civic tech movement gained local and national headlines as well as government officials...but in a positive way.

00:00:42,230 --> 00:01:08,280
so presentation if you were hoping for

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:12,659
something different so uprising is a

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:18,659
crowdsource and it's making it easy to

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:23,420
report full violators accountable

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,420
understand what's taking place and also

00:01:25,729 --> 00:02:13,240
so you should be able to actually all

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,970
right so

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,560
why did I start a database for my

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,260
constructions my task

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,470
um the vehicle that you see that

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,100
commercial truck the photo bomb actually

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,680
almost winning me over in 2016 I was in

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,020
a bike lane I was waiting for that event

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,870
like to change the truck came up next to

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,030
me and it turns so sharply to the right

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,130
that it actually started driving over

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,810
top of me

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,120
it actually pushed myself off of the

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:50,290
side of the truck missile into the back

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:53,530
wheels and after that happened I was

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,540
this driver didn't know that I was there

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,310
and I'd wanted them to be able to know

00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,470
that I was there so we all hear that

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,870
trucks have won spots and so on and so

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,420
forth so I Jason drove for two blocks

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,040
and I caught up with the truck as it was

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,080
just about ready to go under lower

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,140
Wacker on came the photo that you see

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:24,700
there the driver grudgingly rolled down

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:27,640
the window and I tried to reach out to

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,130
the company driver before I tried

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,950
getting very creative unsocial yeah I

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:38,040
was never able to get past the

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,040
receptionist so not only did not drive

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,440
all certificate two weeks afterwards the

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,300
first shared bike rider in Chicago and

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,580
the United States was actually killed in

00:03:49,300 --> 00:04:09,340
Chicago on a dippy

00:03:50,580 --> 00:04:19,690
in a very similar situation so in the

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:21,580
United States a lot of us in reality

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,100
there's a lot of room for improvement on

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,840
cyclists or killed in Chicago every year

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,289
on anymore

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,949
the photo that you see above the spike

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,659
those are laid at the site of a crash

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:39,520
that is killed a cyclist as a way to

00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:42,659
memorialize their lives in Chicago we

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,780
are very lucky that we actually have

00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:49,720
hundred the last time I did an analysis

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:53,080
there's about 340 miles

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,629
however we know all the items do make it

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,830
safer to like they'll also make it more

00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:02,379
enticing for people some big offense

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,270
females in particular are much more

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:11,550
likely to place if there aren't like

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:11,550
points president but what like this they

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:22,690
are driving and it's and as I was doing

00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:24,009
research to this I spent about two weeks

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:29,349
researching this before I actually

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:31,419
launched it just as I was interviewing

00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:34,750
cyclists and kept on hearing the same

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,060
thing over and over and I feel like

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,680
nobody cares

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:44,560
they you know they got the city didn't

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,520
care they felt like the company and you

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,469
know after so long

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,940
you just feel kind of public waters like

00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:53,680
this for taking matters into their own

00:05:48,940 --> 00:06:00,370
hands which is not good for anyone like

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:03,159
Jackson is not justice taking your

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:16,539
u-lock that's meant to protect your bike

00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:20,500
games on stolen I'm using it so with

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:22,539
that being said it's probably helpful to

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,029
provide a little bit of background on

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,900
body Kings specifically in Chicago

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:31,389
so it's illegal to block my plans of

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,030
locking bike lanes is it can be a fine

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,919
between one nerd

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,139
$150 dollars and if you're a corporation

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,520
and you hear the construction or

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,430
something like that it can be looking at

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,610
fossils and it's illegal to buy them

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,250
sidewalks if you're 12 years old or over

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,229
so that means if you're 12 you haven't

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,240
actually taken driver's training until

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,000
you're 16 so you don't actually know the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:01,270
rules of the road and now we're

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,289
acquiring those females are less common

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,419
to buy particularly in Chicago than

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:10,509
cyclists study schofield females are

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,280
also females and minorities are

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,949
statistically more likely to hold an

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,909
injury while cycling and South and West

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,530
Side neighborhood in Chicago have length

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,509
police in minority neighborhoods and use

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,789
biking on sidewalks as a way to change

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,039
stuff on the record and many many times

00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:30,789
and Steven that is a part of their

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,900
Houston practice so it's illegal for

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:37,870
them to sidewalk and what our database

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,310
is proven is that the Chicago Police

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,500
Department actually ranked number eight

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:47,919
for top flight instructor components so

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,229
kind of initially there and so what we

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,340
learned is to understand the problem we

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:55,870
can actually buy unique solutions so

00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:01,120
this person actually contacted me one

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:03,310
morning and stated we submitted to your

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,759
database soon it's actually a police

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,759
officer

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:19,750
and they asked to be removed everything

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,860
instruction your name in two days so

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,139
would that mean

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:28,029
so rising contributor sign up on to be a

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:31,649
member to be able to submit to a

00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,899
database we want the database to be data

00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:37,680
rather than just having months of

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:41,020
submissions to get better information

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,370
information be able to also reach out if

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,950
there's any questions sometimes

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,300
companies or see

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,000
will actually have questions that they

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,680
want quality' regarding specific

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,019
instructions and that provides an

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
opportunity for us to allow people to

00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,440
remain anonymous

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,570
so if you do not have legal status from

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,649
country or if you have too much that you

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,290
don't want people to commit that you're

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,639
sitting in the states you know there's

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,430
that line a nativity

00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,370
if you submit one ball or something like

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,589
that we want to be all of them on.i or

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,920
contact information is actually public

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:17,329
information anyone can about

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,870
multiplication with that driver of that

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:21,490
car

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:26,930
that driver can actually Korea in your

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:35,800
so once you can document instructions

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:40,579
and then submit those two so far as a

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:46,430
contributors have submitted this is the

00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:50,810
20 that composite system and that's from

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:58,579
you know so it's just been thrown right

00:09:50,810 --> 00:10:02,240
out here you know the world those ten

00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:04,399
thousand instructions or lets you as

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,990
much as three million dollars vice

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,959
president so and I would say as it

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,209
easier to submit as where it's happened

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:22,600
those numbers are gonna go up

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:25,730
exponentially so they're very it's red

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,290
also once I started to get meetings with

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,540
the department finance and the

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,540
department transportation in Chicago on

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,790
an immediate picked up money i it was on

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,790
anything from the Washington Post to

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:48,079
mention on can see are five times is by

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,560
collecting all of these bike

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,339
instructions into one central database

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,959
we realized that by having multiple City

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,199
submitting to one database we can

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,149
actually have a stronger voice so Cisco

00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,949
they're cooking and bike lanes all

00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,990
across the United States it's not just

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:06,879
in Chicago it's meal court and it's

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,980
Nashville I see it everywhere it's a

00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,689
part of their business operating model

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:17,259
and in Minneapolis just this month or

00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:19,240
maybe last month on us foods who does

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,220
the very similar practice they were

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,319
documented by a contributor to be

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,499
submitted to the database one half-hour

00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:29,680
later same exact truck was involved in

00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:31,629
running over cyclists so Minneapolis can

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,579
actually just joined by Clinton presence

00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:35,559
database and within a couple of weeks

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,480
you know Lee reached out and were like

00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:40,509
hey this just happened to you guys

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,629
contractors of us foods parking bike

00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:50,110
lanes never said why yes I do and it's

00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:51,879
across the United States so we have had

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,069
some success stories so some companies

00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,379
you know they do not condone parking

00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:58,870
bike lanes I think it's like mr. Upton

00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:18,670
actually surprised by just how positive

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:27,189
some of the companies are you know

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:31,230
modern you know the very next morning it

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:31,230
will be visible submission prior to

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,889
[Music]

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:53,160
actually I'm super super nice guy and

00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:03,480
ultra mean you know that's everything

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:11,550
and you were so we had

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:14,160
so as today they still have not been

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,320
submitted to the database again I'm a

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,340
vegetarian I went vegetarian for a very

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,380
very very long time

00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,270
at no point times about everything I was

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,010
going to have such great you know

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:26,370
sentiments towards a company called

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,830
poppy but I do so I think that goes to

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:37,290
show a lot and there they are they

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:44,700
actually so they actually so everyone

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:48,170
submits to the database and we and we

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,820
map those instructions so we've not done

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,640
quite not so you can you know actually

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,670
see exactly where it is that goes along

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,190
with it but we all if anyone has a

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,760
background with napkins if you have a

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,490
hot spot of you know a lot of things are

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,340
happening if the address is exactly the

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,600
same it just looks like one one point so

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:27,410
that's not good so you also need to have

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:29,970
and when able to deliveries construction

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,250
municipal vehicles and what we've been

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,560
able to do is we actually put in turn so

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:41,480
you can actually you based on this map

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:44,790
so you can relative to the taxi scoopers

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,040
so we actually launched this new one

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:51,150
filtering feature and literally the next

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,870
day and as we shared it and to show them

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,240
this data you're like it is awesome and

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,220
their first response was you know this

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,630
is just that super super clear that you

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,120
know there's a couple of areas in

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,790
particular that we very easily be able

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,500
to chew up ryder's now so they shared

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,350
some information from where their

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,060
projects in San Francisco on Valencia

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:18,810
Street

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:20,850
more to come on them donors and we know

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,650
that all of this data needs to see what

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,020
it turns already beautiful year so we're

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,300
starting to collect and analyze the data

00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,930
year over here so right now we're

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,090
working on a 2018 you know construction

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,160
summary report and looking at you know

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,980
just like how can we do you know

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,570
Matthews and categorize so that we can

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,970
search the database not the really cool

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:47,160
metrics and visually but also be able to

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,900
do those hard numbers were things like

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,520
who is the number one he's district

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,200
that's receiving people expect

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,530
construction this place this your plan

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,300
you're probably not a surprise 42% and

00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:03,510
near the downtown police precinct so

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:05,400
it's so is that Tom please eat they

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,130
might actually find this information

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:14,870
useful because if they're low on ticket

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:14,870
numbers then 42

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,940
there's that for the most part companies

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:47,900
respond pretty well to us reaching out

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:50,130
there's some double down however you

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,910
have to look at it a little bit closer

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,130
because when you look at it by mile it's

00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:00,740
actually protected by playing by mild

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:05,100
intervene you know submitted the most so

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:07,260
you know per mile where is like are 39

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,150
so we start to look at it a little bit

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:13,230
close from a little bit closer you find

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,750
some more interesting so and because

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,910
we're all submitting to database we're

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,819
able to see what are the macro level

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,819
trends of these categories so in Chicago

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,269
[Music]

00:17:27,119 --> 00:18:55,869
we can actually see it so the so one in

00:18:52,929 --> 00:19:01,029
particular was submitted 15 times the

00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:05,080
car was the car that was below that was

00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:11,679
like 13 again it wasn't and these

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:14,139
weren't like okay these people are no

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,419
this is very hard for work and I leave

00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:18,489
my car there the entire day and I did it

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:20,559
once and I learned that it's okay so I

00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:25,570
did it again and again and now I know

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,190
that I have a parking spot so we've

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,559
identified well over a thousand

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,450
companies that are the offenders you can

00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,230
see you know the trend over there those

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,830
at the top and it really

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:40,580
it's off so no surprise Hoover taxis on

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:43,160
USPS and FedEx are the top corners

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,130
however we have a lot of unidentified

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,820
right chairs and what we've found is

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:52,610
that we feed that probably in the top

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,240
four if they have better markings on

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,370
their cars

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,620
so typically lists don't have stickers

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,020
on the back of their cars and typically

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,610
a cyclist is talking on from behind so

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,900
it's easier to see that it's a cooler

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,150
versus a lid

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,030
however they typically do you know ride

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:10,429
third draggable

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:13,750
and we've got some actual successes and

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:18,200
light impacts on the structure so when

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:23,750
when a new bike instrument uprising was

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I shared on NBC last summer the very

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:36,679
next week our house box bollards

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:39,740
installed so Transportation the

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,929
Department of Transportation I was so

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:48,530
surprised just how progressive they've

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:51,140
been they've actually won and interested

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,460
in the data they're very excited from

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,860
the data that we're collecting and

00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:17,900
trying to see what opportunities there

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:21,020
are opportunities there and we're also a

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:25,190
lot of university I've ever seen

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,660
monitoring mustard and passengers here

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,400
required to get a US Department of

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,890
Transportation number and that number

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,820
makes it very easy to find a lot of

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:39,080
information specifically on crash it is

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,980
eyetality whose injuries and from that

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,049
we can actually make it a lot easier

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,059
to identify some of those vehicles and

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:46,520
reach out to those companies and see if

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,370
there's an increased risk

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:54,030
so we're stitching together some pretty

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:57,450
large datasets on so there's a two-year

00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:00,059
expand window on where is 1.5 million

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,820
companies will sue and those companies

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:12,150
are involved with 270 thousand crashes

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:14,730
on over 3 million violations and run

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:20,520
that it's not just about that my

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:27,390
instructions make unsafe to anybody is a

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:28,919
cyclist or it makes it very unsafe you

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,070
know I don't know if you walk here from

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:39,240
rim but you know they're putting metal

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:42,299
sheets out there you know so and we also

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,270
know that winter is not mind to anything

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:52,110
in Chicago a little Roman streets so we

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,950
stop it we're actually while I own zero

00:22:52,110 --> 00:23:02,820
bike lanes

00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:09,480
I am adopting all seven and everyone's

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:12,900
going out there conditions are what we

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,210
learned is that this is information to

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,799
the Department of Transportation as of

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,350
right now we've been doing one of their

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,000
data based on what lane was updated last

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,919
on the Excel spreadsheet

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,380
so this is done like eyes on the ground

00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:31,890
information qualitative quantitative map

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:41,309
everything and so I think it shows what

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:44,940
we can do with our and our database is

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,980
also useful in times of tragedy so a

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,130
cyclist was killed in Chicago last

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,299
summer in Bricktown and when I saw the

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,299
vehicle that was involved

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,369
[Music]

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,900
[Music]

00:24:30,790 --> 00:25:42,110
so this is very very very new it's on

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,540
trying to make it more user friendly and

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:52,970
it becomes easier to submit and we get

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:55,790
more technologies built in relationships

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,260
relationships we know the city

00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,610
decision-makers are really good things

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:04,440
in our data

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,200
the qualitative quantitative information

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,029
and you've had one it's really great if

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,490
you have the other if you want them

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,049
together it's amazing because one

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:17,100
without the other just provided some

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:34,830
more questions and we're able to so many

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:37,950
myths and you know we're really able to

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,679
help reduce strain of city financial

00:26:37,950 --> 00:27:14,220
resources versus you know just be like a

00:26:40,679 --> 00:27:17,429
morning we're telling people in the

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:40,169
moment in the lane it's gonna cost

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:46,320
raishin it's so you can also super

00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:53,490
school there's going to be a party as

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:58,710
well we also take on sponsorships and

00:27:53,490 --> 00:28:03,620
then also there's a so you can change

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,620
your name you can change your name you

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,620
know

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:21,720
or like obviously people are using

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:23,040
Rogers so with knowing that I'm somebody

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:29,990
pick you up directly outside of

00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,990
