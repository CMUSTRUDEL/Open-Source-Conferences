Title: Steve Blackmon -  Building and Merging Personal Social Graphs with Apache Streams
Publication date: 2019-06-06
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online activities into common formats and vocabularies, primarily the Activity Streams 2.0 RDF syntax adopted by W3C. Users can process the archive files they download from apple, google, twitter, instagram, facebook, and more into structured graph data and load them into any RDF Triple Store. Additionally social graphs from multiple persons can be merged and examined together. This talk will describe how this process works and demonstrate how to do this with your own data, and pool your data with your friends, family, and colleagues.

okay everyone see black minute people

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,930
mad find your buddy

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:25,350
they can be here for coming to the

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:30,900
conference and for leaving lunch early

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:37,550
to come see my talk and VP of technology

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:39,780
at equal pattern and CTO but also

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,110
importantly Revere the amusing chair of

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:50,960
a patch extremes which is a product that

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:56,129
I think is pretty cool too so baptistry

00:00:50,960 --> 00:01:00,539
didn't 2012-2013 graduated three years

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,120
later when energy streams buzz was

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,409
created there was an effort that had

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,320
recently begun among a lot of companies

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,119
and organizations and you can look the

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,939
solid trend time called activity streams

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,259
the idea was de creative vocabulary for

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,299
online control of information about

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:25,070
profiles and posts social networking was

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,990
kind of a sentimental operation tools

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,450
beyond that were just getting around all

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,860
of those services and yet there was no

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,270
comment made to express those concepts

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,770
into activity streams that they will

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,340
take a shot at describing how about my

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,200
work and did and that's the street whose

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,570
notes would provide basically kind of a

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,090
reference implementation built in Java

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,399
that you could use to create systems

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,829
that would pass data around real

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,630
activity streams we found quickly that

00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,880
one of the main important thing was that

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,280
there's a lot of data in very specific

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,140
places that have their own formats

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,530
they're believe guides and then we could

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,209
provide basically a bonding that said if

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,300
you're interested in getting data from

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,100
those who are fire hose or from YouTube

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,280
channel

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,720
Instagram page then the way that you do

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,770
that and into shoots formatted as

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,490
follows

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,900
so a good amount of code mother's adult

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,850
and pushing into the patch extremes that

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,210
support makes me kidding me mr. data

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:36,020
from G's money buys but doings of using

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:43,580
a canonical description of a profile

00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:47,210
page that's for a little bit activity

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,220
streams through the w3c social working

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,800
group being is not talk like a

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,860
thirteenth recent standard basically

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,180
this is the increase one of their a

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:04,610
visual ways of expressing the sort of

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:07,430
information and is now basically because

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:11,320
between factors such that it is based on

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,440
needs aren't yet how the data ecosystem

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,280
with the support for JSON montine

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,370
basically thousand things e way of

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,100
saying that it's not just JSON documents

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,980
there's the idea that the global

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,350
namespace and ontology of a particular

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,300
setting and particular network can live

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,400
in a place you can always go there to

00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,590
find out what sort of data is expressed

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,100
inside of the contents that you might

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:40,220
get from na VI and so petty Street has

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,990
that working on the down dating

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,000
upgrading our code to be compatible with

00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:50,630
this new who activity streets 2.0 format

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,630
which now the underlining is based on re

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,210
about a lot of things that can be done

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,980
to deal with this data as graph data not

00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,700
just as talking to people because if

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,400
score it really is grab data some of

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,240
this things are but the website is reads

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,310
not a pattern please join the mailing

00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,350
lists if anything that I say here's

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,330
interesting I'll stop for questions on a

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:22,130
couple points and then by all means talk

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:23,070
to me beside so here you know what those

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,760
magic moments

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:30,030
we want to kind of see some of what

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,010
Apaches for use us to offer a lot of the

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,800
good stuff is in this streams can trip

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,120
over where he'll see you the various

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,180
bindings that we built for different

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,890
back-end databases in different what we

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,700
call providers which in this bus stream

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,610
places that you can pull data into into

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,070
the streams format you can see right we

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,680
have some kind of support through

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:56,700
Facebook through Google's to granting 10

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,160
artists SP to Twitter to being at this

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,750
point adding a new one is fairly

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,640
straightforward exercise I'll kind of

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,670
show you kind of what is involved during

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,460
this discussion but in general anywhere

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,310
if you either get from an API into a

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,280
format and then turn it into the

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,860
canonical format or download a zip file

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,790
full of stuff from Twitter or Facebook

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:27,960
or looking like this much more time now

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:32,580
though there are legal divorce so big

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,170
companies are saying individual users

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,690
can come and get some rather their data

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:40,110
and we'll get in the way to me that's

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:45,990
not all we can program to it the way the

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,100
EPI and yet being able to take the the

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,500
contact business you've accumulated

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,420
inside of a service be able to get

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,880
access to the raw data I think is a very

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,970
valuable thing I think we'll be in to

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,700
see an ecosystem innovation based on

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,810
those exports and reusing the new

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,250
creative ways and interpro as more and

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,740
more a leader that kind of shifts into a

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,520
model where they important because only

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,230
an afterthought so close the point of

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,760
doing any of this well I'll show you

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,670
some parts of the people that are

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:22,970
depending reduces for what we do with

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:26,490
this so the people we are an audience

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:31,919
and we seem to make public the ground

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:34,110
consumers action for marketers and kind

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,750
of a common theme that you might wanna

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,140
do is find people who

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:45,300
within a particular seat or finding

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:48,030
influence from my city so if you go to

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,190
the Twitter API they have a location on

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,680
the business tree they are actually you

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,840
have to kind of interpret people pattern

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,140
has seen many classifiers that look

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,130
across the various appeals and turn them

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,720
into team structure data when prediction

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,520
is based on whatever information we're

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,890
able to see about the profile that might

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,510
include where they live what gender they

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,590
are

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:16,470
then what their digits are so this lets

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,330
us do interesting things like search

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:28,500
across a database for a particular topic

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:36,240
type in Apache and so we know right off

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:40,410
there that wasn't we here to break down

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,380
what their different interests are male

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,050
versus female or if they are the sort of

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,500
stuff and this is all for intermediate

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,210
we have agency and grant clients who use

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,430
this application to try to find an

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,830
audience so that they can then reach out

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:03,180
to them with messaging or with the

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:05,210
direct direct messaging we're at the

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,860
street who's kind of comes into this

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:11,820
actual normalization of data from across

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,470
networks which is what we do we take

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,210
multiple point Wireless works with into

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,030
a portrait and then take the posts from

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,830
all of them and analyze them together in

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:26,040
order to support these lives about three

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:27,960
sheets here I'm trying to say and some

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,400
of the options that are presented you

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,500
can even pull in profile of the follow

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,780
of a specific account that engaged with

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,210
a specific account that a contingent

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,089
specific keywords of contacts see these

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,440
channel logo was basically select the

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,930
different channels where doctor said the

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,880
title search is supported but now it's

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,399
no longer become the only reasons

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,949
this data to understand how to go ask

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,540
for it how to normalize it how to index

00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:57,579
it or how to use it the application

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,589
Shakespeare it's this concept of the

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:05,920
data may come from a variety of formats

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:09,550
right shapes about relation about uses

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,850
drugs so many of these seeds sorts of

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,790
ways to go to beta are also supported in

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,370
this Reeves code base and reading the

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,620
documentation list you can find what's

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,870
the appropriate Java class diagram to go

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,870
out team n theta phenomenon lost for

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,360
having been kind of a simple a pool of

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:37,420
information we index it in such a way

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,519
that you can do the CV search across you

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,220
know be a part of the document then we

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,709
also provide essentially facets around

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,399
these different items diligence

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,720
rotundity provides segmentation on the

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,990
audience that you need empower our

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,439
trying to get if you could drill in on

00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:01,420
us or the age bracket or several you can

00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:03,399
feel it in on specific cities again all

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,009
over all of the stuff kind of live

00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,750
updates then you can look at the

00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,430
individual most influential account so

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:17,019
then consider them for some kind of

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:18,550
application so this is you know the IT

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:23,259
tech track this is pretty kind of

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:26,550
steered I'm tech stuff but I'm real

00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:33,959
interested in want to talk about the

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:36,399
social graph data so as I mentioned

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,380
activity streets to point out was been

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,389
officially released and our code base is

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,180
now providing support for activity

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:49,569
streets 2.0 based on our camp a little

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:51,670
league data which is very cool and so if

00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,139
some of these contributed modules have a

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,720
section called experimental features

00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,490
that will be sleepwalking through for

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,500
interested what Java class

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,170
on top of the zip file that you

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,540
downloaded from Twitter in order to turn

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,810
it into circles that you could then work

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,250
with the new database then this is

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,270
currently supported on Twitter Instagram

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,920
Facebook Google+ already downloaded your

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,280
Google+ data before you enterprise I

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,910
think it's on my not and YouTube can

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:28,040
work on so what's the point of doing

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:30,440
this well I'll show you essentially how

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,260
many basically downloaded all these

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,320
supplies just show you like kind of a

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:44,350
staple of what the data like myself

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,350
looking like so here it is

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:10,200
so those all that you can get if you go

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,760
to Facebook and ask for ear export has

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,180
an entrepreneur's in it and a bunch of

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,730
JSON data and some folders that have a

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,620
lot of pictures right so I'm going to

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,570
given this well to be honest there's

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,779
really not any weird you can take this

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:29,550
immediately getting funny basically

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:34,020
they're just doing their obligations and

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:37,050
it's wrinkly but I think that the open

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,510
source world can actually pity here and

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,870
both these extra words actually become

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,820
useful to to normal people that help the

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:50,700
affordability become a real thing as

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:53,250
opposed to just an idea and feel the way

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,310
that you do that is to extremes to then

00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:01,170
take this data on lisen and then know

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,910
that locations with my twitter file is

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,640
also a bunch of folders containing some

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,339
json needs a little bit of

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,920
pre-processing my google plus similar

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,480
but then one actually needs this you

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,779
have to basically be compact we're in

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,029
this particular by the way is subject to

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,040
change at any time and so if you've

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,120
export again next week you might want up

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,029
to something very different

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,800
I think any practice there is projects

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,870
in every three to four months it's not

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,550
uncommon to like ceasing the data share

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,990
about worrying at the CFE to refactoring

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:38,910
the puppy about the export deaths so in

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,180
order to make issues full looking source

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:46,950
that I'm just used to know and what

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:52,560
Majesties then we'll do then of teachers

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:59,399
and final run this conversion job and

00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:03,450
now you have a one file export and you

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,220
have an NFC device for my peers that so

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,990
this is the turner file to me when

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,790
complete with with turtle or RTF okay so

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,700
those are the profile this

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,980
and XS first of all this is a Twitter

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,020
profile here's the basic file of

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,010
metadata when I went into the profile

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,780
Janus final here's what I found there

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,570
these prefixes basically describe what

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,230
ontology this particular predicate comes

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:34,020
from so AAS news for activitystreams

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,250
departed which they did another business

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,010
stated one that quite a while for

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,470
describing basically individual business

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,780
contacts identification right and now

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:46,050
here is all of the bottom levels that

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,820
were discovered inside that file if I go

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,600
further down now I start to see like hey

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,610
here's like tweets here to the CC 9hp

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,690
use mine direct messages and so on and

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,670
all the stuff is sitting in that file

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:02,880
but it's not super useful in its data

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:06,210
for not here I have built RDF triple

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,070
store on my local machine looking around

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,470
has a community initiative offers free

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:14,700
usage out to repositories of mine

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,110
working triples which is a lot so now

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,050
that is datastore

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:23,010
I can run any kind of query I wanted one

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:26,490
applications so let me talk about you

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:29,160
and I'll say people repository classes

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,990
and what this is saying here i think i

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,570
think we're had one but it also they

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,060
show me your the types of data that's in

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,700
this repository so if I'm interested in

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,220
LinkedIn profiles I can click through

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,770
and see a URL the LinkedIn for the files

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,630
that were in this repo I can click

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:50,520
through them to see individual can tales

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,960
that we rotate from Burlington and I can

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,840
be this long from Twitter and Facebook

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,110
and Instagram as well whatever be that

00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:01,440
can't be a privilege to run those sports

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,880
this go basically that that's

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,240
interesting now I haven't we - basically

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,710
all of my contact about my networks and

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,480
all of my communications with those

00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:14,070
contacts that I have a free text search

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,900
on in my instructional time I lost you

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,120
for a minute in masking my husband

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,570
questions before I get into the next

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,210
stage just where it gets real okay so

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,010
the next stage is I can get this data on

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,779
my own

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,970
and my friends team two can be better it

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,190
continued be basically give each other

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:37,190
access to parts of our games actually

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:39,410
yeah it can be done to so last year we

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,560
had some friends started to squad and

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:45,440
our goal is to help Democrats in this

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,269
data to win elections and we all live in

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,269
Central Texas that we really focus there

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,449
we got a handful of campaigns to kind of

00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:55,070
support what we were trying to do and

00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:57,260
we've kind of reached out to the

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,550
progressive ecosystem and said a we're

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:06,350
trying to build a tool that'll what

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:09,049
progressives use their data and to share

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,549
data into this kind of data Commons for

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:19,790
a specific purpose and we are working

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:21,669
for company around but essentially he

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:25,549
gave the bull a place the big become

00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:27,049
long in drag and drop files that belong

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:31,190
to middle or belongs what's contained in

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:33,980
were volunteering from digital basically

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,960
a shared Dropbox and then we built put

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,450
behind it that way process all these

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,309
files figure out what they are turn them

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,770
into triples and then load those triples

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,960
each other in a different region

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:52,910
campaign and then Commons that goes

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:54,230
across the contains so basically the one

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,360
of the reasons is going to market it

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,690
essentially campaigns that are working

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,210
with us of access to success tools that

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,770
include search and visualization over

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,770
the networks of all of their supporters

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,910
so this is a tool called the curious its

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,330
commercial that's not free

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:20,419
I'm sorry it's basically just looking at

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,990
my local micrograph Remo and I can

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:27,790
search the find a specific entity

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,790
right I found then see this is a

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:39,740
much your rhiness but basically these

00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:43,190
cards represent different types of data

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,510
that were in there and they saw a lot of

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:50,480
these are activity streams needs-based

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:52,670
earth car names based properties we can

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,890
do things like gravity to individuals

00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,620
and then say showing the taiga spot that

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,530
connects these two rather those bandits

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,780
show the network diagram but I connect I

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,809
can say I went on this is exploration to

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:10,700
the most connected leaders top 50 that

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:11,059
are connected to the zoo right I think

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,669
so

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,710
it goes off it blows up all of these

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,750
note I'm a little one we're next to them

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,110
that show around the other nodes they

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:25,870
have them guessing a lot of these are

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:28,520
probably this profile other profiles I'm

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:32,179
sure that as you start to explore and

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,370
expand here differently across this

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,040
graph you can kind of start with one new

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,350
drill in and then start to build a

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,510
picture of whatever Senate relationships

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,880
did you think you can active me in order

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:47,390
to get volunteers someone to come to and

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:52,900
then and also the lead to get people to

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,900
turn out to vote in Texas which hardens

00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:01,190
so I guess in conclusion the punch of

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:08,120
stream is trying to help solve a problem

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:10,070
that it is universal ability and in a

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,350
way or the commercial in cases that

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,740
support that ecosystem are not very

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,780
insensitive actually so that's a great

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,270
opportunity for our open source project

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,250
to try to help make that to solve that

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,809
in a way that can be applied in sleep

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:28,549
and the more of our data that we can

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,650
globally make the interoperable banking

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,200
folks then the more innovation we can

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:37,400
have and the better products the

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,700
services in relationship so let's go

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,440
talk thanks for coming

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:55,169
so we don't like to ask a question

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:58,259
believe my okay well one is that there

00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:01,559
are commercial kind of data that we're

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:04,169
treating sources that are widely eaten

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,019
by marketing groups or consumer products

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,580
companies and business to business

00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:12,090
companies much less so that were used in

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,009
politics so some of those have a have

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,230
extremes modules that will allow you

00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:19,200
like show me all the phone numbers that

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,029
I have I didn't find out additional

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,570
information about that in order to

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,859
program protection so long in service

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,049
we're offering right now is that you can

00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:36,299
upload your data from your contact list

00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:40,049
based on your Linkedin and we build in

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:42,629
the contact list of all those models and

00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,970
then we go to third-party solutions and

00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:47,429
for us we can then add a bunch of

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,840
columns to those words so lumping a kind

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,869
of build a master spreadsheet of all in

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,659
the context of your keeping and then a

00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:56,489
little awkward in science amount then

00:21:53,659 --> 00:22:02,789
and then we have a kind of the whole

00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:04,980
look reason to get more social media

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:07,499
attention or it get more attention from

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,350
the press or when were a ventilator

00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:12,629
veteran and there's just an entire

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,789
journey from deciding that you want to

00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:16,289
run for office it's a kind of building

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,659
rapport network that then you can be

00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:22,340
more netware disco expands to get enough

00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:24,600
may recognition and positive like that

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,809
or the leading a purpose kinda like a

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,960
science in doing Sona community base

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:33,029
play where you know someone who wants to

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,509
help your friend run for office and then

00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:38,759
can basically opted into while still

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:44,309
redeem ultimate control over all the way

00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:46,230
from that's used so one thing that we

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:49,109
like to say is there data to be

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,840
weaponized against you by certain

00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:52,610
players so you might as well happen to

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,190
you

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,570
to both inform your friends make sure

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:12,690
that they don't get caught the

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:14,310
misinformation the street because it was

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,510
born as a reference implementation for

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:21,180
to these streets which is the you know

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:36,840
the primary effort to pop one way to

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:38,670
describe all the social profiles in this

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,010
project actually predates a lot of those

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,320
projects basically taking the terms

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:46,800
three meeting and using it to describe a

00:23:43,320 --> 00:24:00,030
very white ship for batch processing but

00:23:46,800 --> 00:24:02,400
yeah but if this project you know

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,830
continues to evolve and grow to where I

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,260
would like to see it grow then we can

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,630
essentially use open source to build

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,300
tools that allow people to recapture

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:15,030
data by limit about them from various

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,040
places each of their own data sets so

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:21,900
you're not captive to deployment let

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:23,910
interact with integrate data that's what

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,090
leads to mr. Graham and I'm limited by

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:29,880
intercept connectivity they are willing

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:33,290
to spend time you could just get that

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,290
data bring in the new

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,700
so the question is how about like to be

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,240
under angle how to make up most of them

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,980
cross-posted most of the community would

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,870
need to do that if already and about to

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,779
scream to customarily then something

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:07,769
that I think we start to mostly focused

00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:10,649
on being a consumer but for example the

00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:13,070
the Twitter SDK that's our other Twitter

00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:15,690
modular conscious dreams could be

00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,899
altered with in a data center to provide

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,610
to a and then you could basically just

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:22,230
convert the boost from the normalized

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,409
form back into the Twitter form and then

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:34,889
push it out and that would be a that's

00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:36,899
been in our stock yet to that point in

00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:38,669
order to get to your own kind of control

00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:46,669
table then he says be read by

00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:46,669
