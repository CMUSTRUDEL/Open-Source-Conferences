Description: 
	Engaging people in conversation is the best way to promote ideas of diversity. With this goal in mind, the Google Cloud Open Source Team created in 2017, the first edition of the Apache@Google Summit. This event aims to support and provide Googlers across the organization, regardless of their background: technical/ non-technical, with the right tools to increase their contributions to Apache Projects. Amongst other initiatives, especially designed to build and continuously support the Apache@Google community, the Summit is the ideal platform to onboard new contributors, help people understand other cultures and backgrounds, and most importantly is the right vehicle to share different perspectives and experiences amongst Googlers. A recent study by Bizzabo revealed that 70% of event speakers at events across the world are male, therefore a thoughtful and encompassing events strategy creates an opportunity to have speakers from minority groups. Building relationships and educate on Apache’s thought process is crucial in order to deliver great contributions. In this talk, we will share some of the best practices and recommendations behind Google’s diverse events strategy and community building initiatives around Apache Projects, providing the audience with a framework to create a diverse events strategy in other companies.
