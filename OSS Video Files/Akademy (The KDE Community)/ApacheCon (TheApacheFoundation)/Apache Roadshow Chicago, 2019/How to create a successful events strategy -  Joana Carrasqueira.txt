Description: 
	Engaging people in conversation is the best way to promote ideas of diversity. With this goal in mind, the Google Cloud Open Source Team created in 2017, the first edition of the Apache@Google Summit. This event aims to support and provide Googlers across the organization, regardless of their background: technical/ non-technical, with the right tools to increase their contributions to Apache Projects. Amongst other initiatives, especially designed to build and continuously support the Apache@Google community, the Summit is the ideal platform to onboard new contributors, help people understand other cultures and backgrounds, and most importantly is the right vehicle to share different perspectives and experiences amongst Googlers. A recent study by Bizzabo revealed that 70% of event speakers at events across the world are male, therefore a thoughtful and encompassing events strategy creates an opportunity to have speakers from minority groups. Building relationships and educate on Apache’s thought process is crucial in order to deliver great contributions. In this talk, we will share some of the best practices and recommendations behind Google’s diverse events strategy and community building initiatives around Apache Projects, providing the audience with a framework to create a diverse events strategy in other companies.

	00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:54,899
people together to share ideas so what

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:57,660
I'm going to do today in which we want

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,140
to bring community together and share

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,960
some best practices so I'll use this

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,119
example of something that we did at

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,390
Google as inspiration for you to 0

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:18,030
minutes so just a little bit more about

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:22,259
myself I'm a pharmacist so my background

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,990
is in the pharmacy community healthy

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,330
communities and of course our County

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,850
communities so that's why I are going to

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,759
community buildings for open source

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:39,380
because I care about people and I

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:43,619
believe that open source people so in

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,960
tiny country next is named and my

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,509
previous job I worked for the United

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,299
Nations for four years enabled me to go

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,790
to 48 countries where I work very

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,790
closely with local communities

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:02,759
communities so I wanted to bring all

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,950
those experiences that I had Korea into

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,520
open source and to really understand

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,649
what can we do in terms of diversity

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,830
efforts to bring our communities

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,830
together

00:02:26,250 --> 00:03:13,470
so for us to come along and get support

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,470
and better guidance for us to all the

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:23,590
citizens so our one of our directors she

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:28,830
presented a dislike which I would like

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:33,489
to which has no statistics from 2017

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:49,900
dated but she shared that each hug

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:52,959
breakfast has a record which is great

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,019
our record is decent enough don't think

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,140
it was intended to be low approaches to

00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:03,610
not the source no instruments and so

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,860
that's why that's why we need more

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,410
diversity to be poor people and more

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,440
contributions than our equality really

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,830
main projects to scale and make them

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,430
better

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:19,419
so we've been talking about diversity

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:22,870
and inclusion and I promise I will be

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,169
the same exercise when I just put this

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,169
slide

00:05:50,180 --> 00:06:31,640
so we are trying to have to also

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:35,660
thickness difference as diverse

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,610
inclusive and strategic in

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,350
communities and I'm going to say it

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,300
again because I think it's pretty

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,660
important for us really think about

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,390
events as a diverse inclusive and

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:58,570
strategic platform to build our

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:58,570
communities so

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,049
[Music]

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,700
[Music]

00:08:49,580 --> 00:10:35,030
so so so what can we do to address them

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:56,030
by training them and the second one is

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:56,030
we can learn from each other

00:10:58,209 --> 00:13:05,009
and it was it was interesting and so

00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,009
this was extreme

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:34,500
so when I say I really like this picture

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:39,810
because if it clearly shows in terms of

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,790
diversity of drugs risk basically what

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:54,780
we are working towards that so this

00:14:41,790 --> 00:15:00,150
picture industry so we still have a long

00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:03,620
way to go in terms of the speaker's

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:08,120
diversity I just wanted to challenge

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,500
which is how well the speaker management

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,250
represent the demographics of your

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,360
audience and you have a little comment

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,360
that you personally thanks how was it

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,360
notice

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,070
[Music]

00:15:43,740 --> 00:16:16,380
when it comes to each other

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:14,270
and then I like to say the treatments

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:19,610
they're not isolated events that we just

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:23,060
create together ambitious news them has

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:26,150
a language to push our agenda nominees

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:32,110
or even to the community we want to

00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:38,380
change as a community and then we can

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,380
fold so why do you communicate

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,720
[Music]

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,990
label the

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
so

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,959
[Music]

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,039
with immunity

00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:37,860
