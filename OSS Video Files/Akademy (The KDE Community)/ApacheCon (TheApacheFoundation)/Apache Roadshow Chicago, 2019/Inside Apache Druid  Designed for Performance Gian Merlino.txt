Title: Inside Apache Druid  Designed for Performance Gian Merlino
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	Apache Druid is a modern analytical database that implements a memory-mappable storage format, indexes, compression, late tuple materialization, and a query engine that can operate directly on compressed data. There is a patch out to add vectorized processing as well, which we can expect to see show up in a future release. This talk goes into detail on how Druid's query processing layer works and how each component contributes to achieving top performance for analytical queries.

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,859
[Music]

00:00:31,759 --> 00:01:48,290
so yeah

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,780
[Music]

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,229
[Music]

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,130
[Music]

00:04:24,940 --> 00:06:14,020
[Music]

00:04:26,800 --> 00:06:14,020
so the point is large it

00:06:18,520 --> 00:08:18,410
but request a certain value sort and

00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:21,820
that average well affected if you would

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:24,820
absolutely agree challenge that waffles

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
cylindric

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,090
[Music]

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,350
[Music]

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:15,299
[Music]

00:09:42,339 --> 00:10:22,339
so then you should be district Arkansas

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:25,329
but make sure that means two things so

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,329
speedy ingestion

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,120
[Music]

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,970
[Music]

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,210
[Music]

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,640
[Music]

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:16,420
I'm getting this that's the meeting some

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:20,190
kind of action for the severe but vision

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:26,130
centres decided way of action instance

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,130
as a very meaningful but the trailer

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,920
[Music]

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:45,200
[Music]

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,970
[Music]

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,889
[Music]

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,340
[Music]

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,479
[Music]

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:09,820
[Music]

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,220
[Music]

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,409
[Music]

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,350
[Music]

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,899
[Music]

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,809
[Music]

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,149
[Music]

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,500
[Music]

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,389
[Music]

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:54,680
so before I do this the insurance

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,680
agreement having ice cream

00:16:58,800 --> 00:19:00,580
so so so the opposite three computation

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:08,640
slow assignment is that commercial

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:08,640
variations of the sort

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,309
[Music]

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,000
[Music]

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,480
[Music]

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,160
[Music]

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,789
[Music]

00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,709
strange

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,019
[Music]

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,869
[Music]

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:45,330
so that is rare for that solo logic

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,330
story isn't my patience visually is

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,979
[Music]

00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:19,020
something like what's the visionary then

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:19,020
we the first ones here

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,499
[Music]

00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,650
[Music]

00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,650
[Music]

00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,309
[Music]

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:25,590
and that's bogus camp is also different

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:30,090
emotes you think bubbles in gravity lies

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:34,290
blacks really out of the city

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,290
you know and Wes you

00:25:40,010 --> 00:27:28,750
[Music]

00:25:41,160 --> 00:27:31,750
so this is the firstly skin the other

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:34,419
then you apply filters to it then once

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,220
you've rejected by some profession to it

00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,230
projections are going to be like math

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,090
expression specialist actual on filter

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,220
things and then I want to connect me to

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:46,290
columns on a second columns whatever

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,290
least these are all basically optional

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,960
[Music]

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:29,719
[Music]

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,420
[Music]

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,380
[Music]

00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,600
[Music]

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
the

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,329
[Music]

00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:33,470
that's what my music injures as he my

00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:37,159
actual shooting themselves really

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:40,940
demonstrates out on a gym so result

00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:46,779
shooters they don't miss initiation or a

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,779
second that that way you have to close

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,409
[Music]

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:23,140
[Music]

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,809
[Music]

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,359
[Music]

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,609
[Music]

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,059
living day is how long

00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,799
[Music]

00:34:18,389 --> 00:36:11,040
so this is

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,999
[Music]

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,059
[Music]

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,559
[Music]

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,409
[Music]

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,690
so

00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:20,139
[Music]

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,239
[Music]

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,110
[Music]

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,659
[Music]

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:18,110
[Music]

00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,309
[Music]

00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,889
[Music]

00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,969
[Music]

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,790
[Music]

00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,389
[Music]

00:39:46,940 --> 00:40:00,030
but one is that the is also so times

00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:03,060
different this time where you are today

00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:05,609
and I have effectively constant one

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,510
dimension Sony tool there maybe that is

00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:08,510
