00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,359
[Music]

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:28,740
I went to a conference service

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:30,700
applications and the application was

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,419
something that my friend asked me to

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,679
build in Syria marketing communication

00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:42,970
that would let me put a value 1 at the

00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,810
influencers so use thank you both the

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,110
most about

00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,760
consumer products or all depends and I

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,520
said yeah sure be doing a circle

00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,130
disintegrate so so he pointed that and

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,450
then you know me to them and either so I

00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:01,090
went back to Philadelphia

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:02,380
I had dollars working and then you know

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,940
we started talking you'd say hey you

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:10,390
know our biggest leaving room here and

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:13,030
you wanna come out just for a while

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,460
I said that sounds great let me ask and

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:26,130
see if they were promote and so I asked

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:26,130
him I showed this grant application

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:45,480
pursuing so quickly moving back in with

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:52,660
my hospital and my friend clients

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:58,030
working towards a straighter and you

00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:04,360
know officer races and basically we

00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:06,010
build was figured out that you know just

00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,900
taking over comments the number of likes

00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:11,250
and you can figure out how many users

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:15,820
gonna get and as murderers say like the

00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:19,060
Coliseum figures and so we what was

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:22,150
called in Stuart and it was instantly

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:26,140
get your instagrams worse and everybody

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:29,110
loved at different shows my 16 so we

00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:32,200
quickly learned that instantly I was

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,510
very difficult work with they were kind

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,360
of strict they actually had to report a

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:39,850
video of your app in the sandbox and

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,580
then you had to complete a short

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:47,460
questionnaire and be very careful not to

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:47,460
say like after three or four rounds

00:28:28,320 --> 00:29:20,139
we're doing it for us or potential

00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:27,399
stewards for everyone else they shut it

00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:31,029
down so happens you must later show that

00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:46,139
everyone access this and our fledgling

00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:48,700
little business and I was like got a job

00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:54,269
since year and a half years data science

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:54,269
for a manager like interflow

00:29:54,629 --> 00:30:00,970
and just two months ago I left my job

00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:01,919
because I got another money for a new

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:16,299
project

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:22,509
it's healthcare related newcomers I see

00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:26,619
a more fresh - Wow we're looking for

00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:28,570
people to deliver vitamins on any set of

00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:41,039
key places or this is passionately

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:41,039
whether its technology just got married

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,200
[Music]

00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:59,710
this talk is going to be about life you

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,109
sure about nation itself and not just

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,929
products talk about one point of view I

00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:05,769
may be the recently appointed secretary

00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:10,830
of affection

00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:10,830
so that means I basically take care of

00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:24,749
the organization must I really own

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:34,629
members list or something one's asking

00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:44,859
if anybody observations I remember an

00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:47,710
officer volunteer assistant Secretary's

00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:51,249
trying to read or simpler and smaller

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:54,480
positions and basically I'm a dependent

00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:56,950
but I hate money by having a volunteer

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,499
Treasury report or earning third

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:03,159
position when secretary things not like

00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:05,700
a something I can do something to do

00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,700
while waiting

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,900
[Music]

00:32:20,530 --> 00:33:48,679
in specific position little right there

00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:51,950
when their positions on this technique

00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:59,510
let's say leadership dictator technician

00:33:51,950 --> 00:34:02,059
because basically all opened up to you

00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,490
to our Board of Directors and hang

00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:06,650
people members all will look for years

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,590
right so basically the books off with

00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,629
them well they're not the ones doing the

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,770
innovator basically like directors of

00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:14,770
our managing

00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,770

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,270
[Music]

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:18,400
we have one interesting conversation

00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:24,549
which is Bill English tracking that we

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:31,529
want to solar station is started with

00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:36,509
one purpose we want to understand how we

00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:39,509
can be because there sees not only

00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:39,509
diversity

00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:29,129
[Music]

00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,040
[Music]

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,979
[Music]

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,760
[Music]

00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:47,030
[Music]

00:40:42,400 --> 00:41:14,450
see what everybody else does anybody

00:40:47,030 --> 00:41:17,720
else and an entire ship so the first one

00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:20,150
I think this is pretty honest right here

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:25,970
that I remind you completed your

00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:31,040
waitresses love everything like a seven

00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:32,810
morning session purchases for us that

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,230
being direct the nation because that

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,350
actually lower our angle for throwing

00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:45,020
synonymous even with all of our new

00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:48,350
sponsors or event we're still actually

00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:51,650
vintage so those donations are

00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:56,420
appreciated but the first of certain

00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:59,840
issue is obviously for coffee and you

00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:06,970
know passing disperse slack just doesn't

00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:06,970
work okay really this is not the same as

00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,760
brainstorming lunch or a brainstorming

00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:16,430
over didn't bring you guys do which

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:21,680
amount automatically which this jargon

00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:25,900
eat the bestest what we meant to do get

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,480
excited about and write news or simply

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:37,820
you know ambitions to sit down these

00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:41,690
people control including exactly what

00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:43,730
they watch we don't have that right so

00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:48,940
how this

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:53,589
since this is a Catholic genuine spot

00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:57,740
and he was very sincerely emoticons

00:42:53,589 --> 00:43:02,270
don't worry emoticons usually come

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:04,510
process sometimes but you actually talk

00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:09,130
something they stay small self

00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:09,130
confidence in our projects disagree to

00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:21,770
like just a real light in expose their

00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:24,349
there are always grand person but JD

00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:26,510
general really apply Andy actually to

00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:32,410
keep the rest of the places in that kind

00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:40,210
of angling so yeah deliberate adjusted

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:43,400
basis I'll play some faces with names

00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:46,640
yeah unfortunately the social media is

00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:53,900
easier but that issue of the base for

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:55,550
the illustration just start playing with

00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:00,770
this something

00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:04,880
how about me today again I would say it

00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:10,010
also a sad manual labor fangirl one of

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:13,579
our most respected project members to or

00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:16,190
a year or five years of members and only

00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:19,099
didn't eat the universe's hypothesis a

00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:23,839
genuine person standing there and

00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:27,319
actually interesting even work can't

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:30,770
forget about that friends impressive

00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:35,510
Oxford that documentation some recent

00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:46,819
photos to demonstrate you were there or

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:52,069
would have opened my Nisa dangerous and

00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:52,690
it's also not so innocent but at least
