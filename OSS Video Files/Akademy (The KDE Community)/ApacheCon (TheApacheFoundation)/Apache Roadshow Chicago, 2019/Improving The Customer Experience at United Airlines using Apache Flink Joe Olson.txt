	00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:17,279
in Chicago track for all sorts with very

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:22,410
interesting stories today in Chicago and

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:26,359
we would be remiss Airlines and Joe is

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,359
going Joel's going to introduce to us

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:36,440
experience using a pension fund so Joe

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,610
thank you very much

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,469
all right it's actually my second

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:46,520
o'clock I lost it back to Thomas

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:46,520
yesterday I'm gonna close it today

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:59,300
yesterday's fine that versatile slides

00:00:49,950 --> 00:01:01,500
here are gonna Kathie Lee so the talk

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:07,950
will start out United in the airline

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:10,170
industry opportunity look at complete it

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:20,880
can be used to address the opportunities

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:24,740
that are right now 14 aircraft and

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,740
that's 79

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:39,799
single-aisle you can see over hundred

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:42,720
more people and there's 250 an orderly

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,579
so wait there the takeaway from all this

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,710
is maybe it's got a whole bunch of

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,509
supply chain problems to combat it

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,110
you're gonna plead there 1300 aircraft

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,610
you got all the stock the dock all the

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,759
supply chain all those agents all the

00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:03,119
any made a problem we have with 1300

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,500
anything they have you know there's

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,619
nearly 250 passengers last year so

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,500
they've got very busy public facing

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,030
website they've got a mobile app that

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,890
users they use one of those things sells

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,430
six on the line so if you ever want to

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,670
see you know that Cisco time component

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,340
to them be closer to see kids to

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,610
departure no more senseless seek excess

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,920
supply in demand it's got a geospatial

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,750
component to it's just one of their

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,760
craft shows us exactly aircraft they

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,160
also want a pretty complicated program

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,230
definitely people and flying public

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,230
without video all the real fire programs

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,530
out there people want to be part of the

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,870
program status on the airlines they can

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:05,030
get the benefits of status so there's

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:07,380
millions of people in that survey

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,770
analyzing customer needs things like

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,510
that and then initial baby ancillary

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:19,350
sales things like buying snack boxes

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:22,620
playing all that stuff there's 4980

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:26,160
departures for the airline so all the

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,290
scheduling problems operations on

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,830
whether or not painting all those data

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,560
problems associated with those things an

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,320
airline has the screener conspired

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,530
airport served 28 countries those are

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,600
going 24/7 there's my baggage claim

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,820
checking is all around the world this is

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,239
going on that's all streaming data all

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,610
the German stuff and you have to

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,100
maneuver through the airport indicating

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,540
the next return on the plane and there's

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,220
they need thousand employees scheduled

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,850
so an airline is very complex machine

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,000
it's always in motion the future is

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,620
always in flux there is a regional

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,989
system and it's kicking out the leads of

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,299
messages today

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,920
the police is really a data science

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,019
stream every week every problem that

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,090
there is out there in airline and city

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,640
every major data travel design spell out

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,330
there some part of their airline hands

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,400
so if any of these problems

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:34,650
you once that in career or swapping them

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,210
in airline I think the places they're so

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,759
business goals we have as an analytics

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,789
team obviously improve the customer

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,699
experience be able to reduce friction

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:48,330
when interacting with the airline going

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,860
through an airport looking anticipation

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,960
to all these things everyone else you

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:58,710
want to use analytics to make that

00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:00,509
better user experience the messaging

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,740
across the different channels if you be

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:06,180
able to edit in the airport you might

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,060
have the mobile and all these different

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,979
channels we want to be able to Google if

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,460
it consistent message across all all

00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,599
those channels in addition to the

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,789
customer experience you also want to

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,520
improve employee experiences yeah maybe

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,740
thousands of online people are actually

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,289
making airline work part of the

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,590
analytics experience is improving the

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,969
employees so we spend a lot of time

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,270
trying to arm employees with better

00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:37,110
tools and better tactics to do their

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,120
jobs better we can learn from past

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,779
experiences what worked what didn't work

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,259
and try to use those to make media

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:48,090
suggest changes to the processes revenue

00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:54,569
generation that's another very big this

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:56,520
is how do we increase one paper the

00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,069
company how do we stay competitive with

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,949
other airlines in the industry all those

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,740
are English classes and then finally

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:07,190
improve operational reliability better

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,719
prepare for weather situations

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,759
maintenance issues while service

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:16,169
interruption systems that back so here

00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,569
are some ideas that their airline

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:24,240
industries I just went around different

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,830
websites all airlines are service

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,870
companies so we're all trying to solve

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,580
these problems and different airlines

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:35,219
have different needs different they're

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:37,440
different and everything from including

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:39,230
the mobile experience to having services

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
set up already

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,340
I'm borderline at their problem over

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,820
there ignore all these things are

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:51,770
currently being looked at by different

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:55,010
airlines of Defense's okay so what we're

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,410
going to talk about today is through the

00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,050
customer experience is social media so

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,260
you know it has a social media team it's

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,970
staffed 24/7 online and its sole purpose

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,250
is to reach out to people on social

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,780
media and huzzah wishes and if the any

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,800
service company these things look at

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,090
something at that future so it social

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,070
media represents you've got community

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,780
service company and if you go to our

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,210
people social media team these people

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,530
this is what they'll tell you you know

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,090
be able to connect to a customer

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,140
familiar environment everyone use of

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,040
social media

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,570
instead of making custom go to a an

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,430
airline specific site maybe you can

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,920
interact them interact with them in a

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,640
medium that they're familiar with you

00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,400
can also use it to manage the brand tell

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,040
that this is what it's all about this is

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,110
what we're trying to do we're trying to

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,570
improve the experiences with customers

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,640
you can build community and advocacy

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,330
obviously that's an important one and

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,940
then finally during is used to probe

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,080
each channel so they can handle

00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:01,070
expediently next we're going to talk

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,460
about here so that's the big question

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,490
there is Kevin do social media giant

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:10,580
issue tracking database that's what the

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,610
goal here is that's not what anyone tell

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,710
me deep down abstractly I think that's

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,620
really what any service company needs to

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:23,000
do is can you use social media ads on

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,280
place to track issues so some of the

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,730
obstacles in that are obviously for my

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,360
talking to social media isn't with any

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,300
any

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,349
identifiers other than social media

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:39,919
channel can you sum up social media with

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,960
somebody your customer database and then

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,510
enrich the experience because now you

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,860
know more about that that's a very big

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:53,030
oxidant that outside of social medias

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,610
people want needed or if I may take it

00:08:53,030 --> 00:09:06,230
on any company account rather than our

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:08,210
own leaving their information is there

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:12,200
an issue what is the issue of somebody

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,250
on social media they have issues with

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,810
something either trying to explain

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,110
something what do they actually trying

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,490
to tell you if it is an issue what is

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,720
the current state of issues it's not

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:27,920
going dialogue this person's been having

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,130
a couple days a couple hours to share

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,330
change in the context what is the

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:37,100
current state of Michigan and then

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:41,810
finally over 30 recommendations are kind

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,700
of English that's a lot of the issues

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,830
that customers have with the service

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,050
following you know a finite never

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,240
replies is there a way to a deviation

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,370
that's out there drop it in one of these

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,860
buckets recommend a course of action

00:09:52,370 --> 00:10:01,190
successful past the deal with that issue

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:04,060
and then who's invested which doesn't

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,790
put the hand of issue you got this party

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,390
specialist to deal with so all of these

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:15,680
need to be overcome within a few seconds

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:17,540
receiving notification act on this this

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,250
information and use it to better the

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,230
customers banks so we order to each one

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,230
of these there's really a bunch of

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:32,150
things they're doing here extract we

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:36,770
talked about identification what they

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,000
are who this person is and what is what

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,250
you put what you've done with them to

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,160
past what their current state of the

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,080
company has classification of

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,400
prioritization maybe some of these

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,400
issues are more important than others

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,690
topic you I'll stay determination again

00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,580
what is the current state of the issue

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,720
this is all going to be part of the

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,700
process

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,110
recommendation in clustering obviously

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,840
are there any recommendations how do you

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,650
make a recommendation on what to do in

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,560
this situation

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,690
I need clustered this with other

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,990
situations that have occurred and

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,390
reaching to that pocket to say these

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:25,450
that's the big in this situation and

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:26,920
then again router was issued so if you

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,570
look at this there's basically what we

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,240
have to do is for several enrichments we

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,330
have to do and we have to check state if

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,130
we can solve those problems

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,190
low-latency will probably be able to

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,130
complete the customers pairings and then

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:46,240
obviously all this has to be fought on

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:48,700
time in any elastic if there's a weather

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,420
situation something goes wrong it

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,300
affects the system as a whole

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:59,950
elastically scale up so that you can

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,210
meet them and so one of the tools out

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,310
there any frameworks out there that's

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,420
perfect for solving this type of problem

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:11,530
is actions like staple complications or

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,570
data streams so it's a knit but during

00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,780
application the architecture most of

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:21,400
these diagrams I got the actually what

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:25,420
are they act like website this is a

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,760
staple streaming tool so what this does

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,700
is it processes the message coming on

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,180
them store them

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,300
whoever you want and since we talked

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,910
about three parts of this obviously once

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,410
we figure out how every framework to

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:51,130
convention there's a few options for

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:52,840
that I put two of mine here actually one

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:57,330
is enriching we have to go outside the

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,770
pretty more to get the second would be

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,870
constants even conveniens the second

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,160
string so roll over each one of these

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,180
that I was explaining a little bit about

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:11,080
how the actually full response low

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,470
latency so option number one is

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,660
disparity straightforward you have

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,970
social media messages coming in from the

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,270
source you turn that into a key stream

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:25,320
the key generally me by the identifier

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:27,210
the individual has these I'm not doing

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:32,210
that function he picks on external store

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,210
and you can look up a bubble stuff back

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:40,740
we've gotten with this is this is a

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,240
synchronous process and if the process

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,790
is slow that's going to slow down a

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,900
pipeline now generally speaking we don't

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,850
have millions tens of millions of social

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,100
media requests today it's much much

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,030
lower so this maybe is an issue in this

00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:00,660
case what we'll talk about easy for this

00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:03,270
solution just go through this link

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,500
framework has a solution handle is for

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:09,240
high frequency not situation is so big

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,820
plaintiffs got an insecure this function

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,880
independently distinct accents for a few

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,680
peers not that conversion point you

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:23,040
right now I think their latest release

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:25,230
is one point eight so it's a general

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,940
asynchronous model I want to send data

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,130
to this thing and I'm not going to wait

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,950
for it I'm going to keep on classes and

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,450
at some point that data is going to

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:38,040
return the meeting I'll process that

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:41,430
once I get done with that is plenty to

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:47,160
support asynchronous requests so a lot

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:52,830
of cases massage the remote data source

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:56,660
so that it actually means to connect so

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,860
here the example of that issue coming in

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,480
what this is this would be something

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,220
like or Emma Street and we need to

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,420
classify into a string string Clinton

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,780
situation I was fearing they might

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,470
classify the function in point to do

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,230
this essentially has different variables

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,030
obviously it's night now time out the

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,920
service doesn't respond in that time on

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,270
it's considered a failure handle the

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,860
failure situation you've got a number of

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,830
gas attea how many of these you don't

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,780
bust you want suit up before here

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,940
certainly get

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,340
the database goes down you got a

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,140
thousand requests acute ah maybe you

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,540
want to slow down the pipeline until the

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,730
database covers the external circuitry

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,440
powers maybe not maybe you so I keep on

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:45,290
pushing things through and unclassified

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,770
get to ordering variables in this you

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:51,620
can say whatever order I send things to

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,450
get classify I want the back of same

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,640
order I got that for some of them that

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,920
can uses there are they're classified in

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,620
the case of the social media and

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,730
generally order isn't important I'm

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,490
going to send a bunch of tax data

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,490
classified when it comes back I'll deal

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,730
with it when it comes back in the event

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,380
of as exceed it will happen as a student

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,870
as a server just put that pressure on it

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:19,970
and it will pick on the option number

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,990
two is actually joining sprint this is

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:28,280
kind of slip picture I've been a

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,870
situation where a bunch of customers are

00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,750
experience something and something in

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:36,080
the system fails and so what I need to

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,240
know is I need to know what the current

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,610
state of the system is so maybe the

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,040
compare line at the situation where I've

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,210
got the Third Point scheduled in another

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,970
queue I've got all the people coming in

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,260
on one social occasion

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,020
what's the stream processing engine

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:58,940
logic viewers actually models so strange

00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:03,050
so if the customer says hey yeah we can

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,730
easily link that customers customers on

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,160
social media handle up to a reservation

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,240
and pull out what their reservation is

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,850
enjoined the extra money on employee

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,340
hypnotism certain points and find out

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:21,950
what optional flakes are so they had all

00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:23,870
begun would be joining the stream if you

00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:29,720
a couple different options for joining

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:31,790
it screams one of the actions of window

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,090
join which is basically if you work with

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,440
any steering frameworks one of the

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,020
elements in the street vendors pass the

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:44,960
one no way yeah well the fight windows

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:47,900
fallin to understand move over time

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,080
everywhere to find as a session so

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,000
joining screens in plank that first

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,670
option is to join elements within a

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,670
window so maybe a window is a game

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,310
whatever it or don't even find that's

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,930
one actually saw kind of join these

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,880
streets

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,430
another option is littered will join and

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,280
that's basically gets selected join

00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:19,530
Colin timestamps in this case in this

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:21,120
case we can define an interval shooting

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,880
framework that's let me been actually

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:29,690
heard and you can say okay I want to be

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,690
able to join the defense sighs so what's

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:36,180
plus or minus a few minutes on this

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,930
fence and I can join other events that

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,930
occurred in that segment

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,670
okay so the other thing we're gonna have

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,010
to do is problem with to Richmond

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:53,030
options this is the state management

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,990
action so again the point is a staple

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,900
statement streaming platform so they

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,590
give me plenty of tools to manage danger

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:09,060
when I say state what that means is

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:11,150
suppose I have a social media entry and

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,560
then two hours later I tweet that back

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,720
those would be considered the first

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,180
people considered learn all of the

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,190
states the interaction having that

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,930
custom now that's a gross

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,580
oversimplification of found because when

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,660
you define where the state confers on

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,760
that what kinds of juice this tweet is a

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,560
part of chain all that hours all of

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,380
those those those interesting situations

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:38,360
what we'll talk about here is how they

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:42,510
actually stored in the spirit level

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,100
normally what you do is the first option

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,660
would be okay out this way I got our

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,580
streaming platform I'll just wave stuff

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,780
doing database and I'll just interact

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,549
with that database the client-server

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:56,809
take - yeah number that is that

00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,769
power doesn't scale and that's for

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:01,559
longer coolest April streaming

00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:05,369
frameworks camera or sling off to the

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,230
table ones what I'll do is in my stream

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,119
processor I want Google storage that

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,779
will store statement now make that all

00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,690
about

00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,840
so what happens is when a message comes

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,450
in it's 30 rupees keep straight so all

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,230
the keys go through the same processor

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,029
and the same local storage so the fish

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,549
are in the lake basically says I'll have

00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:31,200
three processors each one of these

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:33,419
systems on stage store each elements

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,029
industry will get back to one of those

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,679
for your processors and Ryan do not look

00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:42,869
up state in those fastest rooms I know

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:46,190
right or go to the way the state looks

00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:48,720
in Plymouth basically keep out info so

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,570
there are several back ends and she put

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,159
up a link to do this key value the

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,730
lowest enacted obviously Ram

00:20:53,159 --> 00:21:00,470
that's very small states and then

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,600
allowing you most latency low estate

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,700
news for state but that will be stored

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,080
in RAM on different executor so it's

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,809
really a function of each one of these

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:18,749
executives and that's the second option

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:22,460
is your interests or file at this store

00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:25,259
state and then finally they've got a

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:30,929
back-end just rocks which is there any

00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:36,989
database design or graphic value or low

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:39,239
latency situations and the next estate

00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:41,460
you can actually start simplices who

00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:45,179
stormed out so I've got a Twitter handle

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,309
and yeah interested it simply when the

00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:51,600
last time I dealt with that issue so

00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:54,830
that value as a key would you put the

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,809
key in and return time state the other

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,629
state operators one is the state I could

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:04,649
just keep getting new state on the end

00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:06,580
the old state so every message I have my

00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:09,790
key I just neck

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,690
the lists like you pull it returns a

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:16,720
list reducing state that's just an

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,640
aggregation a lot of times in to choose

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,920
for like a poor man's little function

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,490
what I can do is I can manage

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,190
I can use some kind of aggregate

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:31,600
function over time based on messages

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:35,380
coming in everybody state takes that to

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,650
the next level depending that takes put

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,980
in I can change you aggregate function

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:46,240
and then finally now state that is most

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,980
flexible you put it in a key states if

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,190
you get a baggy pants let's say key

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,510
value store with them values the good

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,590
thing about that extreme us iterate over

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,780
that see what's what the current state

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,540
is I can iterate over that and say all

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:07,450
these functions this is the current

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:10,540
situation okay Myrtle State this is the

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,030
ability to full state current state

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:16,990
outside of the environment so what I can

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,120
do is all this history we're building

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,920
out going through social media I'm

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,700
interacting with somebody and I'm

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,640
building out a conversation with

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,590
opposition that has the building

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,680
beginning yeah calm so in this case what

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,260
I could do that putting their customer I

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:40,150
could put in their social media handle

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:49,210
an API call and get the value of that

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:50,860
state so the state store obviously very

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,250
important you have to somehow protect it

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,860
from a disaster any kind of fault

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,690
tolerant

00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,540
anything the other day they were wrong

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,830
so we the kind of smart they giving you

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,630
insight we need to do that in a

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,550
statement it basically that's makes it

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,460
we're displaying of the store to share

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:12,430
classes so I have the ability to keep

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:17,620
the states and preserve it outside of

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:20,110
the job executor desk manager Portland

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,590
and at some point if

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,570
job crashes that can't remember crashes

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,770
I can bring what you want and simple

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:33,340
state awful to share file system that

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:35,530
did another no going on obviously the

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,840
more frequently you think state and or

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:41,590
your state is all right it's of a

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,240
tendency dancing last couple uses of

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,330
link and giving really learning the

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,070
snapshot state say the first and this is

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,600
first features versus appreciate like no

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,400
state to their shared store as the

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,710
product matured they mobility all these

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:02,320
signals change the sorting that include

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:04,299
compliance dramatically okay and as

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,390
disobey as when she met - no they don't

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:10,480
function but this back part people need

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:13,330
to do again that's for situations where

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,570
holiday situations were travelers or

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:20,700
actors by their situations there's

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,700
something else that goes wrong right now

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:29,650
active reactive so under one scenario

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,870
after scenario the cluster itself

00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:35,470
allocates resources based on what it

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:39,580
means we have to is completely oblivious

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:42,730
to the environments where committees

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,470
controls I'm going to throw more cameras

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,150
out there because I see a fracture going

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:53,520
on and we need more stuff we're going to

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:58,980
damn it flicka's know is oblivious to

00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:04,510
the manager there the general or basis

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:07,929
those through and I think this is the

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,270
next becomes clinical results like have

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:12,910
streaming automatically scale up and

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:16,179
down and unless to see more so this one

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,040
about inversion frontiers here I think

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:27,450
that will definitely make this scream I

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:27,450
thought more robust it's a true

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:47,440
the presentation of this for this exam 2

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,870
score 2013 - or maybe one of the hours

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,350
together

00:26:48,870 --> 00:27:03,340
it's and that was the state of what this

00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:05,700
features okay so that to our original

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,660
problem so we got away

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,290
- rich sister you've got a couple

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,770
different options

00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:16,840
Richard stream you've got one good way

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:18,790
to save state so the other thing we need

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,900
to look at here is a Portuguese and

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:24,100
which team processes are actually

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:26,530
machine learning applications so the

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,530
question becomes - which model versions

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:32,320
of I arrived in the string so I took

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:39,040
Horace's and themes five one slide which

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:42,970
is how you do that we don't even know

00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:46,330
this is in order to change model to the

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,910
start/stop the string one this is the

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:51,370
target apartment if you heard or is is

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,559
talk talk about this idea controls free

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,280
will you actually implement that in

00:27:53,559 --> 00:28:01,390
place is you do what's called a connect

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,640
join and then you do connect that flat

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,980
map or what's those states to both of

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,230
the steering simultaneously so what you

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,660
can do is you can Louis state can say

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,540
hey what's the model what again it

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:24,040
elicits a glass version of the model it

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:26,290
actually use anything at all - so this

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,320
is the actively it's definitely a

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:33,340
framework we're following if you're in

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:38,640
the streaming type use cases there's

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,640
play ways involved features the monitor

00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:10,259
so I think at this point people are

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,909
actually reached out to the company over

00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,309
social media is small enough or are we

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:15,629
being honest I think it's time goes on

00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,850
and more and more people become

00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:21,299
interesting social media well become

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:23,610
more comfortable in community service

00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:25,909
companies over so she can hear that you

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:30,240
know the pointing to help they're going

00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:34,169
I think they didn't go on and again

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,649
since we're trying to do social media as

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:41,220
a issue tracking database social medium

00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:43,049
is free so we got a huge incentive to

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,169
figure out how to steer people to use

00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:51,210
this there's auditioners and I think

00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:52,799
it's not one more all hardwood I

00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,470
remember that like it's supposed to be

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,299
closely with sharing state so the

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,090
question becomes now how do you do strap

00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:04,110
state into this this would be a

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:07,440
situation where how do you get data into

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:24,090
this thing that you're not doing you can

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:25,830
use or will get likes very well Big

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,669
Mike's at this point again it's not this

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:32,399
is something that everybody is doing

00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:34,620
it's a love you

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,559
it's the handleable why it's more

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,980
serious money meant using conventional

00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,980
tactics

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,570
so the question is now hopping so if

00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:03,780
we're going to use social medias and

00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:05,430
tracking database oh my god what how to

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:26,820
tweet to a service company

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:30,030
so you've got a response organization

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:35,190
you've got a situation

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:37,350
that's my plate is my plate before ours

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,270
finality delayed versus my flight right

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,800
now is the way you want to be able to

00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:48,480
prioritize that sooner rather than the

00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,460
situation it's not the cute because you

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,250
need react on that

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,250
so the prioritization is about and it's

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:21,810
there's a filter out which is requests

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:24,150
from you know tops that's okay thanks

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,700
for just said why not one kind of

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:30,150
tangential question on other things that

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,040
you mentioned what I was curious so

00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,350
you're talking about

00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,850
everybody in the picture with sort of

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,710
things you're using big data for in

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,710
terms of engine performance and fuel

00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:49,940
hilburn and absolutely medicine so I

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,940
have my friends

00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:58,830
so is this actually so are you actually

00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:00,960
using those big data solutions in terms

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,200
of that actually comes up so it's really

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,659
big

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,419
change throughout was just in terms of

00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:12,279
random absolutely you know just like I

00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:15,190
said in the first slide it's every

00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:17,200
innocence about we got somebody at the

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,970
airline is working whether or not it

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,570
will scale on whether we're going to

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,769
block the effects turn what they're

00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,659
doing is something that actually the

00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:29,279
next operations of airlines is another

00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:37,869
story but everyone is exactly working

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:39,789
kind of tools how do we because the

00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:42,690
companies got their own little parks but

00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:48,759
they understand our using ours Python

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:51,759
option aren't SAS you being solve their

00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:58,059
habit and some mystical law might come

00:33:51,759 --> 00:34:01,749
along figure out how Canadians is a big

00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:10,329
area pretty the beacons IOT that's not

00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:16,000
only making stuff some speed

00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:18,069
well I think that entire when the cost

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,399
of automotive air leader from aircraft

00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,609
to the ground in real time balls right

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,319
now

00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:26,470
it's too expensive to do a lot of this

00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:28,359
stuff in real time so in plane lands

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:32,079
close to the station they don't make the

00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:35,200
connects to line line in medics as you

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,210
can see blogs have built up since last

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,809
time at their Wi-Fi station I'll get out

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:43,089
and I think it's you know places la

00:34:40,809 --> 00:35:07,630
quality data from an aircraft well I

00:34:43,089 --> 00:35:13,119
know a significant difference other than

00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:15,119
the public Wi-Fi camera that is evolving

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,329
it's you know

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,549
that's an odd woman it's true think

00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:23,849
about that you movin 85 miles an hour in

00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:25,430
the air you know everyone expects Wi-Fi

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:27,599
to work the same way it works here but

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:32,099
think of all the weather think of all

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,329
the latency issues of all the complexity

00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:39,990
of action solving that problem

00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:42,630
it's actually quite common it works

00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:46,920
better in some areas and that sometimes

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:48,859
part of you know domestic routes where

00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,690
the strong points are where we come

00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:53,249
again you know mostly buys that service

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:58,890
for other third service but it's not the

00:35:53,249 --> 00:36:02,160
airline it runs those things it's those

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:12,559
guys who actually are the one since you

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:12,559
know their purchases that service our

00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:23,670
next sweatin elbow grease everything

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:28,589
everything everything that's out there

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:53,940
somebody can you help me production axis

00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:57,499
so it's everything very less that based

00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:05,299
on weather coming in so for the speakers

00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:05,299
