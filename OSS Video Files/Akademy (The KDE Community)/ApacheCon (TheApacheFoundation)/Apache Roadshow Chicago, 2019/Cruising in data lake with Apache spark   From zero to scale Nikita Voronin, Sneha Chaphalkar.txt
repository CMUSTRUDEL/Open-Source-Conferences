Publication date: 2019-07-08
Playlist: Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
Description: 
	https://www.apachecon.com/chiroadshow19/talks/cruising-in-data-lake-with-apache-spark-from-zero-to-scale.html

As part of Highly Automated Driving (HAD) group at HERE Technologies we build High-Definition Map (HDMap) of the real world to make autonomous driving possible. Given the complexity of pipelines for data enrichment and the petabyte scale of rich and unstructured content, there is a need for a mechanism to avoid data silos and to have one centralized way to access, evaluate and analyze the data across multiple systems. In this talk we will outline the principles and the technology behind our approach for building a data lake to address these challenges. We will provide guidelines for implementing and scaling up the data lake using Apache Spark in the cloud. Presenters: Nikita Voronin - Lead Architect @HERE He specializes in cloud-based solutions for distributed data processing. Specifically, he designs and develops data persistence components with the goal of obtaining logical data consistency, reliability and performance under load. He coordinated the initiative for building the heterogeneous data lake from ground-up. Sneha Chaphalkar - Senior Engineering Manager @HERE Leads the Content Management infrastructure teams that power the HDMap product. She has over 13 years of Software Engineering experience in building scalable resilient microservices and distributed data architectures.

take a seat so we today presenting Lucy

00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:08,400
innovatively from co2 standard just let

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:12,810
me share something when we meet in

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,100
Chicago Jack came home because I think

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,020
it's a time to share architectures

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,420
leveraging some of these source and

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,540
launching projects and trying new

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,310
solutions from it and what better Avenue

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,130
for sharing that so that's where Ruby on

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,009
presenting the stock soon the stock be

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,670
home together share our journey how do

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,140
we stop it off what was our original why

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,860
we went with the segment strategy

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,899
analytics and who are these people be

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,820
sharing our lessons learned can be used

00:01:47,899 --> 00:02:04,829
you can't focus with a bunch of spark

00:01:50,820 --> 00:02:07,069
and what some of the other projects so

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,700
just a quick round of introductions

00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:10,700
provided premise

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:23,760
so I guess technically fish okay so just

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:26,670
really grounds to be built our here

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,010
technologies so this slide is just to

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,409
make an awesome present rarely started

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,629
our original community then why didn't

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,939
we have to go for it the second strategy

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,599
so here has been in industry for 30 plus

00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,150
years

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:45,629
we specialize in location technology and

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:48,180
also building location platforms and

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:59,269
communication platform offerings so in

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:59,269
that comes to scale data a lot of

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,049
fragments so one of the product lines

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:12,419
that we have is here HD mind map and

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:18,449
that is where he instruction which is

00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:20,909
for this and this is nothing but eigen

00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:27,209
function map in order to provide

00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:31,139
insights so it is an extended sense it

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,319
is said but together with that and the

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:42,709
sensors ecosystem if I can take

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:42,709
decisions so the infrastructure which is

00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:51,720
so that is been what is our religion

00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,239
Safari T so with that scale it is a

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,010
qualitative product in which from

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:03,449
multiple sources we get data from

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:05,879
different sources different sources so

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,519
in order to do that we also have really

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,579
a lot of complex they are the points

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:16,019
which are and these are having a novelty

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:18,780
and transportation together that is

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,919
making it just becomes creations and

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,940
totally in the Reena

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,490
especially decisions or you want that

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,979
which

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,689
high-value or figure out any insights so

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,349
we have several valuable feeds within

00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:43,379
our pipelines like we have activated

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:49,710
we have many loop beads and you so that

00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:53,159
means together with this kind of forms a

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:58,110
big mix of complex processing pipelines

00:04:53,159 --> 00:05:00,900
so these pipelines are is actually input

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,229
from one which person poses an output

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:09,889
the other the representation is just

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:13,440
kind of the next a cyclic graph of

00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:17,849
relationships going on data pipelines

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,340
which the others this is also multi

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:21,870
system pipelines eight different genes

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,449
which are maintaining this and that this

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,830
see this is all done by one key so when

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,120
you have multi teams what happens is

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,949
getting series of operation we have

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:39,930
different ways of working that makes

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:42,419
again coming back to our original kind

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:55,849
if necessary in order to drive any

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:59,629
insights from this range means what is

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:02,520
requirements so we have 25 plus

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,919
processing systems they have their own

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,620
pipelines going on the right side again

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:16,020
shows my system which is made with a lot

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:19,409
of interactions and this is all data

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:26,029
statistics so we here writes a lot of

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:31,050
history inside you need to kind of need

00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:34,680
historical trends from these pipelines

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,070
the case is different some might be so

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,560
somebody

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,470
so in our diesel it was the scene we had

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,950
supper which women hollering some 20

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,690
minutes

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:49,360
so the Keating society had different

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,540
metrics commuted from this end of the

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,030
week or what from this kind of Edina

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,030
so we process metrics in each business

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,340
metrics we also need something with

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,320
planted measures if you know how good is

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,270
the quality are we there yet with

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,970
certain coverage so they're different

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,510
insights which accompany the state of

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,510
just sense

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,830
so now to the topic of what is identity

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:26,410
and then we will be deep dive into this

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:29,500
was just so what is the data in it it

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,450
really is a centralized repository the

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,380
storage of own volition and domination

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:38,290
here one of the key trends is that if

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,440
you have some raw data which can give

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,510
insights just bring that delay in

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,460
traditional data warehouse kind of

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,440
schemes

00:07:44,460 --> 00:08:04,000
Starsky power design you - what about

00:07:47,440 --> 00:08:07,450
that tables going on consumption but use

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,510
the data in it and play as much as it's

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,760
possible so that means that it means not

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,890
succeeding there is no widgets my design

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,460
you're just waiting today and then it

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:21,130
could be strongly so that is one of the

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:24,700
kind of crap make the foundations for

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,500
anything so you just feel the data and

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,980
then the interpretations and how you

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,840
could use that am with happy medium so

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,900
with that it provides a lot different

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,060
uses x-ray tree analysis this is

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,590
essentially your AdMob analysis and you

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:43,060
have the data scientist is going in and

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,860
now you just figure out what can we make

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,530
sense of this linear predictive

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,530
analytics if you start there

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:11,850
Davidson's capturing what you can in

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:17,190
order to excite downstream primary

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:22,650
factors so hold on and we go into the

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:27,270
foundation so any that focuses it needs

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:29,220
from smaller storage and range internet

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:35,070
media formulas are the ones which

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:37,830
actually let you stop storage is very

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,250
actually storing the data wearing jeans

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:43,200
not ridiculous are very we're kind of

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,120
getting some insights from this knee

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,990
where every exercise actually you might

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,300
be fingers between Delta analysis you

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,070
have changed or you might be doing some

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,410
kind of training to see much change

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:59,370
Nesta K so that kind of applications

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,790
today now treatment so based on this we

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,370
stop it Arjun

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:08,339
and this is our way of showing a socket

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,600
in this generated strategy semi minor

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,980
procedure this was a strategy we had

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,740
earlier data sources which were already

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,200
present on the musician they had their

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,720
own houses

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:26,760
we had existing data warehouses people

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,770
additional data sources so together they

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,250
were multiple their warehouses so what

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:35,700
that cost is blending how do you blend

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,110
across these different resources mean if

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:44,010
you wanted some data and it's not

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:46,130
available so now you have to go and so

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,839
that kind of course on silent types

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,820
these kinds of challenges is what if

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,860
they stood on my apartment zero in our

00:11:50,820 --> 00:12:03,120
quest for anything ugly things - so then

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:11,450
we started different houses which can we

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,450
use technology to do was our way of

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,070
transforming but when we try to

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,760
consolidate now you are trying to stress

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:26,520
your cluster it now experts your

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,830
contention so going back to your meters

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,690
and Mike respondent your query engine

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,480
was saying and the storage was the same

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,839
and now we are trying to move right and

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,910
they're trying to get attention so that

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,610
is where our cluster optimizations for

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:48,890
something inside us so overall this type

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,890
of effect when we have to strive a lot

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,650
with so many finding different Cadence's

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,690
just keep up with that steel and that's

00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,580
where we have to either bring in some

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,980
database but to make in order to make

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,470
this word or make it more flexible so

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,390
that reduce the cycle time to get

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,240
insights so that's where your journey

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:13,040
started into the actual vehicle

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:17,990
fermentation and I am I

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,670
which is not pleasing at son thank you

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:29,610
so how do you actually solve all these

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:33,140
issues right micro-services you actually

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,330
users start maybe playing by the book

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,000
right we just use the tools that we

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,710
created three CL and you making sure

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,980
that in using them in an optimal way and

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,360
there's multiple issues can come up and

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,380
some of these issues is just getting

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,650
right tool for the job

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:53,310
and the second one is using this tool

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:56,150
very quick because you can do very much

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:59,970
different things yeah yeah what we eat

00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:02,670
we start using a purchase part for her

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,220
own retail jobs and porgy and other

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,500
quality performance like wear ski to

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,510
make sure that the data that we

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,040
capturing is compressed is for the right

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:15,720
way we don't EG teach the data warehouse

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,760
solutions we just start storing data

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:23,280
honestly make sure that the state is

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:29,220
exposed and what it gave us is a first

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:32,460
of all easy to produce with our sequence

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:38,390
using sparkly just forget all there's

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:40,980
some people okay

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,770
most chemo maintenance right so as you

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,230
might know where c4 here how are you -

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,540
just have homes and hopefully using

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:52,040
rights leaders right consumers where

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:56,280
ancients on top of that it allows you to

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,270
don't just become few minutes second

00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,640
most important thing

00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:02,460
writers like this was if a point the

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,740
questions is that they're our writers

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,530
readers are totally separated the only

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,270
point of contention now is let's see

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:16,500
maybe we were throwing data mystery but

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:20,340
you can use your own ETFs pass with you

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:24,600
you're in this situation so it's easy to

00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,840
scale each each job right teams can now

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,970
all their own

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,240
all solutions since they don't have to

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,060
or is fading we lose the another measure

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,220
it there is no permission for resources

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,380
and you can see this little asterisk

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:42,130
here again you can talk about that like

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:46,510
the easiest because probably but anyways

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:50,910
in general there is no resources and

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:55,180
what is there is it here actually it's

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:56,530
your homework right you put your data in

00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,770
the right way with a good compression

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,690
ratio it's actually super easy you don't

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:06,660
no one touches your buckets there are

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:10,060
quite inexpensive you too now so that's

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,490
what I want to talk about there's a

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,560
quick highlight for the Transformers and

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,670
now maybe we can talk about these

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,840
guidelines that we utilized in order to

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,760
produce the data rate so now as single

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,130
kind of pleasure of my company different

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,410
subsystems with that if you just allow

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,330
people to do whatever they want these

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,090
get messy very quickly so you need some

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,030
portable guidelines for later

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:41,020
I mean what is what are some ways to

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:44,200
navigate this place so first of all very

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,620
simple form data signal formats single

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,560
interface if you once know like people

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,350
have to use performance you're swearing

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,750
our date on the speed yeah like know it

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,630
could be servers that like it has to be

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,220
beautified so everyone knows like if you

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,590
work with one day this person one day is

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,540
it for watching we know how to work with

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,270
our antennas

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,430
frequent internet lot things right in

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,190
terms of like who feeding products for

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:15,430
homeless vehicles and the freshness is

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:17,080
important so if your main pipeline that

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,250
produces the Excel data and publish

00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:25,090
textual now is working on one scale and

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:28,120
then every 14 days the rain is just like

00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:30,280
behind that's something good idea and

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,650
we're going to talk later about the

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,970
frequency of updates but in general at

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:38,310
least daily updates all our data sources

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,890
one single one so that's another

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,620
isn't that actually non-trivial people

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,110
starting out there this part is so easy

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,080
to just to enjoy and combine multiple

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,660
data sources but almost things that we

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,430
learned XP keep it simple one day that

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,810
has to be directed like one simple one

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,940
source

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,490
don't try to come up with some very

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,260
interesting views or extremely rich

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:06,120
views people can do this on their own

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,950
negatively right and another important

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,060
thing is consistency in a bit weird at

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:15,180
first so for us again you seem like this

00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,100
huge graph that single view different

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,990
pieces of the pipeline might be on in

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,600
different plots may be working with this

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,690
different data addition forward it's

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,050
very important that whenever we were

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,480
wearing the orange or providing of this

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,580
this whole system that if they said

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,950
smash up on this whole danger awaits

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,200
there's otherwise when you start joining

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:42,920
different tables together you just like

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,920
it you just entering see results okay so

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,570
and finally it's a doozy compliance

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,890
people who work with DVR

00:18:51,570 --> 00:19:00,060
I don't December this joke today so you

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:03,510
have to predict their data and not like

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,570
giving all this stuff again you just

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,890
start exposing your data but at some

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,900
point you just realize that we've got

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,010
the same insane buttons saving same

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,450
tables getting created and for us we we

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,020
found out that we may be working with

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:21,270
these three types of tables one is just

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,130
a longer history and earlier on there

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,470
was talk about pops up and as pretty

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,600
much that's where it is ray which is

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,990
updating certain message describing how

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,660
your dataset changes over time another

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:37,320
one is the latest states right so in

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,540
terms of the map if my lower history is

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,640
just basically saying that there is a

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,230
you sign integer though there's a floor

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,930
over there

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,880
then my latest state is just the state

00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,430
of the map right

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,850
but I can be contused every single

00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:56,230
deception in Chicago now finally there's

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,850
lookups and aggregates those are very

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,370
you can check them over time it doesn't

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,440
factors what googling as well some

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:08,540
interesting aggregates and metrics that

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,100
you can enjoy now once you think about

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,660
it like how you get break use to speak

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,230
tables because working with the same

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,020
dataset effectively but in reality is

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,310
actually remind you about database

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,590
engines Thanks

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,470
do you receive any certain updates to

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,670
your data set you keeping them in your

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,250
transaction log

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,890
if we don't involve two relational

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,290
databases then you're blind them to your

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,790
remember representation and then maybe

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,910
even complete something else you like

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:40,340
changing secondary bases its redoing

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,650
some stuff and so on so that actually

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,840
sounds very well when you like use this

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,150
quadrant with a spark locks when you

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,940
receive in your tea set the loading or

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,500
keeping in memory your current state

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,720
you're changing it in your computing the

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,150
the second three second it excited webs

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,280
or arguments but that's not everything

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,480
right so there's more to them there's

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,400
some principles that I would like to

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,360
show and share with you so another thing

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,230
is that we person everything right so in

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,570
world of mapmaking

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,300
you can't actually teach usually widely

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,700
it's it's what are you changing the road

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,450
or something else it's like it freezes

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,990
this people effect so when we're talking

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:30,140
about the consistency should be priority

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,570
that's exactly right so everything like

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,150
much of Jesus can be bundled together as

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,160
a transaction version right and the

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,680
similarly when we're taking a sponsored

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,500
when we eat you version of our order our

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,520
dick the way it's important to bat and

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,530
automatically produces the fact that we

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,770
call our date is beautiful we never

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:54,500
going back in which particles at or and

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,490
that's another very important point on

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,690
separating readers from writers if you

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,660
if you might find the data

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,810
someone else tweets you got you saw some

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,850
troubles right especially in with f3 and

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,630
everything else it's it's not a

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,610
transactional super sweaty mess so just

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,560
put another version in it and take your

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,730
time wait it might take you hours to

00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,400
produce a whole new version of

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:25,790
immediately and while you do this people

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,740
can still use that you're resisting

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,360
another important thing is that when you

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,730
have this graph or multi friends

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,770
different system that communicate to

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,470
each other and there is general bache

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,340
incorporated with that's why I'm calling

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,770
a pipeline is very important to say that

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,690
this dependency tracking is enough to

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:50,810
enforce rights of you you have to know

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:53,510
that these particular tables so again

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,720
you can see how the ground source data

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,820
that is B suit double powers how it

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,100
affected the map against you on each

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,270
every step what was the effect of this

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,680
data coming in and once you have this

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,420
dependence is ready you can see how

00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,820
different sources are compatible with

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:13,940
each other for historical tables at once

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,140
that's very important so because another

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,150
thing like it you just partition

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,770
everything by tying your still got

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,080
yourself into trouble right because to

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,700
change that occurred on one system on

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,580
one day might be propagated

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,050
couple of hours earlier to the next

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,620
system that does go many different

00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:33,350
partitions it again for t-shirts that's

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:39,650
why the musician Robert boxers versions

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:41,180
are very important so that's that's one

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,510
of the things that I wanted to share

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,950
with you and now some some other very

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,680
important revisions

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,570
absolutely not date formats people tweet

00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,040
they're all the way we trying to tweak

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,580
their own like we don't see a speaker

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:58,190
there any variable is okay if someone

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,830
tries to applaud you it's very vital to

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,120
the asleep maybe's problem use for

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,580
Aurora see that very nice formats and

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,450
under the ashfoundation

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:12,970
one more formats we optimize very nice

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,789
and some with all the

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:18,250
we're engines of beer I cannot see your

00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:21,789
TV but sadly also comes out of their box

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,750
this party alright with someone has

00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:24,610
pledged to put it what about the

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,919
difference at bomb defuse one where's

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,600
the other another very very very

00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,320
important consideration and that's where

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,240
you actually still have this difference

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,000
between recent rights is a housing

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,220
balance them right so you work this Park

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,020
you know that whenever we produce a

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,090
table or anything many data center

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,960
specify how many legal files is going to

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:59,440
create an HDFS s3 GCS doesn't seem to be

00:24:46,960 --> 00:25:02,350
impact rates small files if you have too

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,909
many files slow reads weight like you

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,530
have to download the bullet stop and

00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:08,169
actually the compression is overall low

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,850
and then if you have a very few files

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,059
that you write is super slow even

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:15,549
provision this cluster there vital data

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:17,409
memory and processing very unity but

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:19,360
you're trying to write a one quiet

00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,570
after all there's going to be one

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,820
executor essentially one threat just

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,250
pushing this linkages there's no gate

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,990
Spencer wait so there are mountain in

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,409
sparkin latest versions you can specify

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:35,320
or forget as enquiries as well how many

00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:40,150
rows we want to work for each file

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,130
I mean very nice feature then you saw we

00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:46,110
can also talk more about different

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:49,419
spartax and fix choose to treat students

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:53,350
in general I think like if if you just

00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:55,390
start like experimenting with wire spark

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,070
or teaching your major that's the mark

00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,539
what like I think every single talking

00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,830
which is Google on YouTube and you don't

00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:01,390
suppose partner to position everyone

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,740
talks about it or teaching your data

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,929
that's it like if you've done that

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,230
you're greedy emission codes and all the

00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:11,470
other stuff is this nice nice thing and

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,740
yeah if someone has questions with him

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:19,780
we're gonna talk more about it

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:23,049
finally aware decision right so we using

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,490
either Luis Athena for one of our our

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:29,759
use cases

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:32,830
the query similar similar idea it was

00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,409
addressed oh right so if you want to

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,330
press whatever or having issues with

00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:39,399
Athena usually it's a one-to-one

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:43,679
operation is very very very useful

00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:47,769
actually the advisor is just like Google

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:53,259
G's drivers and disconnect is very nice

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:54,580
to reduce on 200 courses to one finally

00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,649
another like if you want to do something

00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,159
more fancy you can use a question field

00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:02,009
and for example drop grab some word

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,700
about data and mix it in with your

00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:13,179
domain Archaea or barista tables that's

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:15,220
gonna be bit more expensive but finally

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:16,509
you got my sis mark exactly right that's

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,940
just amazing

00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:22,809
wha-wha brings much more you think this

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:29,919
was with the data and share your ear

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:33,279
stuff and everyone likes mumbles so

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,590
another another very interesting don't

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,379
be pointing to learn especially like if

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:42,129
you but building this data but also

00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:43,779
dated like really is to really really

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:46,389
really really really talk to your

00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,669
customers and make sure that is clearly

00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:51,940
understand body bank building like who's

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:54,249
going to use it right so it's really a

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,840
that's what the cost is generating to

00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:59,950
find out like how big they're sitting

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:04,200
fresh to be so they really should give

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:08,350
it a power you every movements do really

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,749
are you willing to pay for it for this

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:15,090
update maybe that's not the right cool

00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:18,490
you know and then there is like some

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,320
recipes combined these things so

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,690
for our first ever news we've talked

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,059
about like this is a lot of small files

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,419
we can still do that you get still like

00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:30,879
we give your small clusters will spark

00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:33,340
that branch on the limited scope or

00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:36,630
taken produces this bias every 15

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,420
minutes it works just fine and

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:42,630
raise lawyers master miles whilst that's

00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:46,470
physically something like that and so on

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:49,140
because like we're gonna do afterwards

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,870
again make sure you butter up these

00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,340
files later on and then compress them

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:58,050
and that's going to look like some day

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,070
like this right once you combine them we

00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,470
can double your latest greatest

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,200
partition on this key or or somewhere

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,180
else your file system that makes a lot

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,500
of these small files that represent your

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,820
up to date like very very fresh data and

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:16,040
then the week every day you just drop

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:18,150
over /the president that's right and

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,680
change and that's the only place we

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:28,050
actually give them to make a reception

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:31,500
for your reusable they planning they

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:40,290
just want so if we have big links some

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:42,420
point it will be so make sure so

00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:46,650
especially with the mutable data right

00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:54,300
you have to be not so again our bank or

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:57,600
cheats yes storage for each if you

00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:00,120
producing certain tables that they don't

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,340
know partitioned make sure that you have

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,990
some trading Widow strategy when you

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,660
don't store the data for the last few

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,720
years do we use it and buy it last six

00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:12,210
months or so wait and another very

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,930
important thing with the checkpoints

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,830
right

00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:18,830
whenever you so how many you Metascore

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,120
okay so that's one of the one of the

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,010
ways to basically that's what Tina

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,610
provided as well you can help with

00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:32,400
advice appearance one its network allows

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:37,650
you to track all these files in your SEO

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:40,560
HDFS and also storage scheme for them

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,270
and work with our internet system so if

00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,890
I'm at the store is not the burden that

00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:47,510
you can require some new table

00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,510
essentially doesn't exist

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,440
basically the important part is that

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,740
scientists or like whatever you want to

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,990
use for it yes they don't care if you

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,390
put your day - somewhere in the back

00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,930
place so you really take your time

00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,730
reducing these tables and then when you

00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:09,930
ready to make them available for them

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:12,390
customer users click not also you can

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:16,230
also use views for that so if you really

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,790
you really want to tables available as

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,640
they come

00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:31,380
maybe you just ask us to use and we'll

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:34,080
switch to other so that's one so we look

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,940
down here so we went from Visio speed to

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:42,360
not the new speed the Tyrrhenian company

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:46,080
actually became the same speed without

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,450
me too much effort so that is where we

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,830
can create some common things and fast

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:54,000
track so some of the things that we

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:56,730
learned through this one this brilliant

00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,380
audience when you're on there but and

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:06,900
provides platform one of the things you

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:09,740
want to share so you can go with some of

00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,870
the libraries for my profession

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,870
JSON representation provide libraries to

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,520
converting it into market for it so you

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:21,630
can provide these kinds of libraries to

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,760
start with before and I don't let me get

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,010
across that that's where you can feel

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,020
platform by which some of these

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,010
techniques which I learned over the time

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,630
can be shared across the same thing with

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:36,990
design factors how do you maintain

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,900
history partition by date all of these

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:43,400
kinds of techniques appreciate to give

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:47,730
you an offer library and based on that

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:51,030
different genes and have the cycle time

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:54,840
for getting that data more data into

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:56,790
more clearly much more faster what are

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,490
you looking with any system you think

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:03,440
that there are different solutions

00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:07,470
could be legions we use there was a

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,950
plastic box - so you can use these

00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:13,260
different techniques in order to learn

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,820
some talking that you can see we're in

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:21,470
this big pipeline

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:25,320
where's the data flabby or first you

00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:29,190
know you can also provide something with

00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,710
smart skeletons running in order to kind

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,049
of time you would keep skip imported so

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:39,630
that they can have a Lea use these

00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:42,029
libraries and use a skeleton these into

00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:45,210
your enemies will start small more

00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:49,289
skeleton starts two different kings so

00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:53,370
you think it was platform so that means

00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:56,190
been adopted so induction so what do we

00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:04,320
cover we cover that there are three

00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:06,470
different parts in transformers if you

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,879
have data sources multiple data sources

00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:11,760
different teams you can have these

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,060
transforms and get that in the alignment

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,179
there's one which will be used in our

00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,800
case for some of the instructions you

00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,859
can use some sever little fun things you

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,000
can do is to use different jackets but

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:35,429
our go-to has been always eternity smart

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:37,230
in terms of storage file system where

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:45,260
you can easily have been necessary

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:53,129
availability and you can use storage

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:55,830
that can be used drill is on that's

00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:58,200
where your final end practice you can

00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:02,580
get reports you can use some law or any

00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:06,180
other communicating you can use freely

00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:13,790
and very those reports exactly but not

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:13,790
books is expressions that by

00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,260
[Music]

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:24,370
so in our is a map and now

00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,980
is he a cute little brother the best or

00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:29,410
as always you guys and correct something

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,710
so that's why we take you data all of

00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:49,020
the meat by plane and just getting into

00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:49,020
our data link but in general like this

00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:57,030
opportunity to want to create income

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,030
stream and spark jumps you're trying to

00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:09,220
I think it Mason's a couple years ago

00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:13,410
some I remember there was a search that

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:17,230
like you know good so that be working

00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:20,140
you're only changing it to like like the

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,270
bowling master date essentially said so

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:25,720
say I'd like that the downstream fits

00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:29,140
that who are actually reading updated

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:33,910
yeah I think one was probably a lot

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:37,900
easier than do it you explore this yeah

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:46,270
thing that people do well this data you

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:48,970
keep laying to do two clusters mess with

00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,460
one and you the other one is linked

00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,500
hello on will do queries then once

00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:59,560
you're done messing with it second why

00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:02,740
don't you speech them wait so things

00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,710
like again you know at least like once

00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,840
we pop these datasets all our tables

00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:13,050
don't play anymore ever

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,050
so we start the next version on the site

00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:30,400
to be paid for constant changes but if I

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,050
question the other thing which we have

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,050
done is that you get our body head

00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:25,420
so do things a this drops right so they

00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:30,140
go and once once all my labels are for

00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:37,490
my latest one today then I go like right

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:43,520
from the driver which another thing you

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:46,060
can do for today and small units or even

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,060
like

00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:33,490
yeah

00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:02,550
if you and you really like used well

00:46:44,530 --> 00:47:06,220
you like are you check waiting sensor

00:46:48,470 --> 00:47:10,220
good state right so when when I

00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:12,500
discipline ization this and just load a

00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:16,280
device and then bring these mothers a

00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:19,220
bunch of flavors that's perfect in other

00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,110
situations for example we running tables

00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,930
that are like sake pastors in fiber

00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:26,480
which is just like way more cost when

00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:31,670
you take them to weigh into existing

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:38,450
people right and that's not a degree for

00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:41,480
example I will be there and then this

00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:44,810
perfectly before that produce six other

00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,760
tables that define these thing was not

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:50,270
going to be over it so next time this

00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,690
people we try not going over edges data

00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:58,600
their mobility however published let's

00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,600
go right right so that's that's our

00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,460
that's what any tracking books use that

00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,210
you know have certainly given by

00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:11,279
underlining

00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:13,400
and may not it goes then you get a body

00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:13,400
