so um

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
i'm going to i'll start with a little

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,320
introduction

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,559
my name is dave fisher i am a member of

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
the apache software foundation and

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,879
for a while last year i was a member of

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,840
the board of directors

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
i'm vice president of a project called

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,920
apache petrie which is

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,800
a place an experimental place where

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
we're hoping to onboard existing

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,240
communities

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
to consider whether they want to join

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
the foundation and become an apache

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
project

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
i am a mentor in the incubator and i

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,040
have

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:20,720
several podlings i'm mentoring right now

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,759
and i'm a pmc member of

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,000
several projects including some that i

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
i mentored in the incubator and also

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,200
open office

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,000
and uh also a project called poi

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,439
which is uh the project i started

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,600
working on

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,680
where i became a contributor and a

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
committer and a pmc member the first

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,280
time

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,439
uh i've used uh

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
apache projects for i guess about 18

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,880
years where we use tomcat

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,640
and httpd and

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,759
i've worked on projects with adobe

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,960
experience manager which is based on the

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,360
troika of sling jackrabbit felix

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,319
etc and done a lot with the

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,879
content with poi and pdf box and xml

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,879
graphics

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
so the topics for today i'm going to

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,800
talk about

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,520
open office web resources that are on

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
the apache.org and

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,920
openoffice.org domains uh there'll be a

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,840
series of links and pictures

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
and then i'm going to talk about how

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,000
openoffice.org website

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,560
is organized uh and discuss

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
um you know some approaches to

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
converting

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,120
from the apache cms to

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,360
some other uh system and

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,239
i think there's some some choices we can

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,599
make that are fairly straightforward

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,720
uh so here's the tour and links

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:06,239
so first place is the project website

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,280
and uh this is at the usual location of

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,159
project name.apache.org

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
and it looks like this this one also has

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,440
to be

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,040
converted from the cms but it's a much

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,159
easier situation it's a

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,159
rather simple layout

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,560
then there's our user portal

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,760
openoffice.org

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,879
where there's many languages etc

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,080
so here's an example

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,480
of uh polish uh

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,159
so this is the site so we see we handle

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,319
translations

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:48,480
uh and um including on the navigation

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,280
and the branding etc

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
it's very straightforward but under the

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,879
hood it's a little more complicated

00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:01,760
and we'll get to that towards the middle

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,720
um we have why pages which also

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,720
can be translated in different languages

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,799
you see we start to have

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
an option for left navigation

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,759
and we have

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,720
you know some older content

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,280
which we can talk about refreshing in

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,280
the project

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
uh we have a project blog which is

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,360
hosted

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
um using an apache roller instance and

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
we're using the full

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,280
foundations blog and we have our own

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,040
blog within that

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:46,800
so um this is the address

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,800
and it has our older uh from incubation

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,680
code and

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
this is where we occasionally publish

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
things

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
we have a planning wiki which is on a

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
confluence wiki

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,560
which is supported by

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:15,600
apache infrastructure and

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,919
it um is um

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
you know we also have another one but we

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,240
won't go into that we don't think we use

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
it

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,960
this is sort of where we you know do

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
various things and planning and create

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
documents to

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,240
to help us figure out what we want to do

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,479
um there are some interesting comments

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,479
on the bottom of this page

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,880
about tend to be around language so

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,199
i know mctilda spoke about that

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,400
yesterday

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,000
we have user forums so this is sort of a

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,160
sub community

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,479
uh the people who have been supporting

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,039
user questions for well over a decade

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,000
and uh there's a few different languages

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,759
here

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,960
um there's a couple that

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
there's a couple that are turned off

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
like vietnamese is turned off but

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
where there's still support from the

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,919
forum administrators

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,520
the the um sites are available

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,560
and they're very active and this is you

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,560
know a place to go

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,479
but we as a project maintain

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,240
uh the vm where this lives so

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,840
this is an area where you know we could

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
use a little sysadmin help

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,759
uh bugzilla uh our bugzilla database is

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,800
hosted on the um

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,479
main apache bugzilla instance

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,560
uh and um the admin

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,560
most admin work is handled for us in

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,479
terms of um

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
of issues but there are a few people on

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,440
the team that help with

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,440
um you know maintaining the ids etc

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,680
and this is a nice

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
older style system but it has all the

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
bugs

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,039
we have a media wiki

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:21,199
which contains information

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,599
that's existed for quite some time

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,560
and this is also on a vm which the

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,280
project

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,639
maintains that emperor hosts for us

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,680
and you can see it's a little bit older

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,360
style layout

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,000
but it's here

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,479
volunteers are welcome to work on this

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,479
as well

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,120
um we have an extension site which we

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,800
maintain for the community

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,240
and um there's uh

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,919
the overall open up our office document

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,240
uh format community so extensions from

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,599
say libra office may be found here as

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,120
well

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,240
this is uh not hosted by us

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,280
but hosted by sourceforge for us

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,080
it's a drupal site

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,560
but if people have problems with the

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
site

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
we can usually help and we can do some

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,960
level of administration

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,280
on the content and so

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,680
you can go to you know our dev site our

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,199
dev mailing list to ask questions about

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,039
it or if you have a

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
private question you can ask the private

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,279
list

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,479
similarly there's a template site which

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,479
is also drupal based

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
on sourceforge

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
uh note about downloads this was our

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,560
typical download

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,160
location this is where you'll you get

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
the latest release

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
and you can choose your operating system

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,040
or language

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,000
you know there's our community builds

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
are

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,800
rather large and cover

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,160
uh four different uh os formats

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,920
um from um you know we have linux

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,360
and rpm and deb um mac

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
and windows and uh i think right now

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,839
it's 41

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,480
languages for localization

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,240
and language pack and full installation

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
so

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,839
you can do the math that's i think some

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,600
like 4 000 some

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,519
files

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,240
so the distribution network we don't use

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,720
the apache mirror system for historical

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
reasons

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,519
nine years ago when we were starting out

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,360
in the incubation

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,600
incubation it was realized that um

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,800
the size of the down number of files

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
that would have to be

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,360
replicated to all the mirrors would take

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
well too much time and take up too much

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
space

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
on the mirrors so we were allowed to

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
make

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
uh relation have a relationship with

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
sourceforge

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,839
and they mirror

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,839
and provide a mirror network for our

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
downloads

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,320
we also are on the um

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
as every apache project has to have

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,279
their

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,959
their distributions their releases on

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,880
the um

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,600
apache server which has been recently

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,360
renamed downloads.apache.org

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,279
so you can find the most current release

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,839
there as well

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,600
there are archives um automatically

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:52,320
created

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:55,440
and that's um

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,760
the location uh here now there are even

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
older archives from the incubation which

00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,839
are

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
and also in the archive in a different

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,399
location

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,760
uh within the incubators section

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,959
and i was looking around there and

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
[Music]

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,959
there are some release materials that go

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
back

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,680
to the beginning of open office if you

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,640
want to look for ancient versions

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,160
and see how they work you can you can

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,320
dig around on that site

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,800
at this url uh

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
we have an update service uh currently

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,279
that's hosted with the rest of the tlps

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,320
but we're going to

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,640
move it um so that we can

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
open it up so that that we have a bug

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,600
right now where

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,399
there's certain versions of uh

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
apache open office that do not find the

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,920
update service they don't

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,120
speak quite the right version of ssl

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,920
these statistics are

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,839
were taken a couple months ago for a

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,880
30-day period

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:11,279
and this shows you know

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,920
the requests that came through

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,000
uh to the update service so we can see

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,440
that we had a million

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,519
1.1 million uh mac osx

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,079
requests from these versions of software

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,399
so this gets a sense of

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,680
that most people on the mac are on 4.1.7

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,839
but there are

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,200
a handful of people using rather old

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,560
versions

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
uh we can even see free psd

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
coming through they seem to be all in

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,200
recent versions

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,519
uh linux uh you can see that there's

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,560
definitely some um

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,519
there's not a lot of users or more

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,040
likely

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:57,519
uh problems with the access

00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,399
windows again it's an interesting

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,279
distribution i'm not sure exactly what

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,800
it means but we

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,800
do actually see some of our

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,160
development uh builds that are actually

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,800
making requests

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,399
um so this is this is an interesting

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,000
little experiment

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,200
as we plan for the next release

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,200
we plan to make sure that that release

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
gets visibility through this service

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
uh mailing lists um probably the best

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
way to go

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,760
and look at the mailing lists in the

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,880
archives now is to use

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,959
what's called pony mail

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,320
and it's at list.apache.org

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,279
and if you go to this url then you can

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,320
see the screen see the recent emails and

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,360
you can get access to all of our lists

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
i think an important one is l10n

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,920
which is for language translations and

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,279
then there's just several

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,160
smaller lists for different user groups

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,120
in different languages

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,399
i know keith and i were talking

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
yesterday

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,320
that perhaps we ought to consider

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,440
turning off a few of these lists and

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,399
directing more traffic to dev

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
something to talk about

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:35,680
okay now for the website templates

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,399
so the system that we use

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,320
um is the apache cms which has been

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,079
deprecated for a number of years so we

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,519
need to move off

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:49,040
but one of the key things we do

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,199
uh to manage things so that um

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,279
we can make easily make changes without

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,680
having to recreate a lot of

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
files

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,720
is we use server-side includes

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,040
so you can see these in this template

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
where we have like even include for the

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,000
doctype

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,720
um we also have um

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,680
parameters that come in uh from the

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,839
headers

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,120
like the title of the page and and

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,639
various things and

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,079
some decisions are made uh based on

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,000
um what's what's available

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,360
on that page so that you can you know

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,720
especially indicate

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,120
uh various style sheets etc

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
um this is like if we're going to turn

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
off google analytics

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
we would all we would need to do is

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,759
remove this line but then we would

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,440
need to regenerate everything

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,320
the other thing would do would be to

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,639
empty this file

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,639
um

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,160
we've got um

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
you know top navigation which if it's

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,440
present

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
is included and we also have some pages

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
that have left nav

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,720
and somewhere there are some pages with

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,759
right navigation so we

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,360
put those in

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,160
we have breadcrumb capability which

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,279
we'll have to

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,279
emulate so you can

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,639
oops

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,279
and um so it's it's really you can see

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,600
it's a

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,560
basic um setup um

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,560
these are

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,800
um just various sections that can come

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,199
in the block stuff means something to

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,480
the cms

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:47,680
but as we go to a new uh

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
build we can transform this as

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,480
appropriate

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
for whatever system we decide to use

00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,480
so for instance server side includes

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,319
are specified

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,959
and they point to different html files

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,720
and then this is how we would like do

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,000
russian and the russian branding would

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,000
come in

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
in its own location

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,919
and similar with the top navigation

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,039
those are in the content tree but you

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,360
can kind of see that this is um while it

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,679
was

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,120
it's marked down we're only using

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,600
attributes here

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,320
so as we move forward uh we can instead

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,000
uh

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,240
make use of something like gamma or

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you know something a little more modern

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,280
um

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,640
than what we were doing before um

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,640
you know it kind of looks sort of like

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,039
camel so we can do that and get some

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,039
structure

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
website brand this is a section of the

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,400
branding

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,000
page and you can see up here there's a

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,200
lot of language selection and

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,799
then there's various um

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,600
ways it comes in uh

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,000
you know pulling a header name with

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,240
choice of the logo so we can do

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,160
you know a customized logo for for

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,559
celebrating something

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,559
um

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,840
and you know just various pieces here

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,000
uh so here's an example of of different

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,440
brands

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
um you know

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,240
the name what language is selected in

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,360
the language box

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,799
the tagline um

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,840
you can see that's not translated here

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:49,520
but if you remember the polish view

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,480
that was translated so it's up to the

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,840
native translation native team language

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
team to decide

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,880
how they want to translate these files

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,880
um

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,440
but you can see it's it's rather

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
convenient we have a couple places like

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,520
for example we can

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,200
we could choose different css with this

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,559
div

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,880
uh if it makes sense for the particular

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,880
site

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,440
um here's an example of what the the mb

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
text looks

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,320
like for a top nav so you can see in

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,080
this case it's actually marked down

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,200
where we're actually specifying a number

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,559
of links

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:35,039
and we're specifying the ci the css

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:38,880
that gets used to create this

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,480
and these are the tooltips and the link

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,480
so this is this is the main one

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:52,000
and then this is an example from the

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,640
german site

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
one of the things we could talk about

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,360
here

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,000
is if we wanted to have some other

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,679
uh structure besides markdown for this

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,480
have this maybe all in yaml

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,120
and and then whether that makes more

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,320
sense

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,440
for uh translation or not

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,159
um i you know like

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,880
i'd love to discuss you know what works

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,240
best for the native language teams

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,559
um well that's the end of this part of

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,200
the slideshow so

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,400
i'm gonna have to okay this so this came

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,600
through

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,240
uh but hold on a second

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,799
i've got this screen that's doing a

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,799
funny thing

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,600
kind of lost my whole laptop screen

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,440
right beforehand for some reason

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
it went to full screen mode mode and it

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,240
got stuck so

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,120
going to share this this screen

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,120
and um

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,840
and then i'm going to click it we can

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,840
look at some pages

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,159
so here i'm more i'm in the template

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,400
area

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
um

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
and this is

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,919
so this is the brand page

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,280
i mean so this does the top of the

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,280
window so you can see all the languages

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,159
and there's a little script inserted

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:45,840
here and then

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,840
the banner section

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
for once

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:12,720
that's important unfortunately

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,840
okay so

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,960
and then this is the the main page you

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,960
see is very simple so

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
um

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,159
this is the whole templates directory

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
that currently exists you can see

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,320
there's just little

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,000
sections for each thing that just have

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,320
that ssi

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,960
so we can obviously there's ways to

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:10,320
simplify this kind of thing

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,799
so that some of these things are

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,600
exceptionally simple they just

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,600
bring things through

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
these are just a common footer for

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,480
everything

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,240
um let's see this is how we get like the

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,679
apache con event on the bottom of our

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,120
page

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,120
um you know the basic basic things

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,280
and see the html page extends that

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,960
skeleton

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,520
um but you know does some wrapping

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,000
what i'm doing with all the html content

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,440
is it basically there's a

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
view that extracts

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,720
um the body and it extracts anything

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
that's in the

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
that's on the body tag which was

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
important

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
so

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,480
these are the basically these the two

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,480
special

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,120
maps are part of the cms where we can

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,320
see that these are

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,919
our template um

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,279
choices uh other systems will have a

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,960
an attribute um in the top of the file

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,039
that chooses what template

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,679
uh is used so

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,799
depending on what we choose these things

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,799
can be

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,520
appropriately dealt with with scripting

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,520
as we convert

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
them

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,279
so you know here the selecting ssi file

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
according to which one's you know the

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:02,400
deepest item there's

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,400
working out the breadcrumbs um

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,799
so there's a lot of stuff that was

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
buried in the cms and how it does things

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,520
it

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,279
just really we just need to find a

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,840
modern way to

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,840
to do those things

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,400
so an html page i'm writing the script

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,400
and you can see i'm doing

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,080
there's some stuff going on

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,559
and then you pass it in but um this is

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,840
um

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,840
and dot htm but pages exist as well

00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,480
let me go this

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:11,840
does anyone have any questions they want

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:11,840
to type in

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,840
i can show you

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,919
carl since you're with us i'm going to

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:39,840
show you um

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:39,840
one page i'll take a second to find

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,840
okay for example incubator uses

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,720
something called

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:58,240
jbank and jbay

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,240
has its um

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,840
templates are done in groovy

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,480
so for example using an xml slurper or

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,559
whatever

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,120
so that's one one

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,960
one thing we could do is decide that

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,520
we're going to do our templating based

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
on

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,600
groovy and doing extraction and stuff

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:35,279
like that using java

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:38,320
code to manipulate the files

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,520
it's devote you know different kinds of

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:49,200
things like there's a

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:50,960
there's a project page in the incubator

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,480
so you can see that's rather complicated

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,480
we could do something similar

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,919
with ssis um

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,080
we go here

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
and the pages

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,399
this is where jbank you know this is how

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,559
they kind of do things this is

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,320
they use this ascii doctor instead of

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,000
markdown but i believe you can also use

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,799
markdown with this

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,799
but um this one doesn't have the

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
template

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,559
oh it's jpeg type is the template so

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,559
this is the template is the home page

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
template

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,559
one of the things that's not so great

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,480
about j bake because it kind of reviews

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,559
all the files

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,200
every time you build so that's can be

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,200
kind of slow

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,840
but that's what it is somewhere on one

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
of my screens i've got

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:26,240
another possibility that people

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:29,760
suggested is hugo

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,480
and this is using you know go

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,600
it's etc to do things i'm not as

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,200
familiar with this

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,200
but um it could be

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
you know reasonable view

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,559
they have page variables and site

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,840
variables which are kind of what we're

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,840
doing with ssi

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:09,840
and see similar language with the double

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,840
squiggly brackets

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
okay so there's a pub

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,840
yeah i can i can visit the pub later um

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,000
i'll get new people welcome

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:40,559
kind of uh towards the end here um

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:51,840
looking for some questions maybe

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:51,840
let's um

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:19,840
i'll just go back here

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,720
do a quick

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
just a quick review since we had new

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
people enter

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,039
we reviewed uh just a series of lengths

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,640
native language this conversion that can

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,320
happen so you can still use the

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,320
subdomains you end up over here

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,600
the y pages that have navigation

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:59,120
our blogs planning wiki

00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,880
user forums which we maintain the vm for

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,480
there's a team bugzilla the wiki which

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,480
we also maintain the vm for

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,080
extensions templates

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,200
downloads um

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,720
and then where the just the distribution

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
network that we're using sourceforge

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,360
mirrors

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,320
um and then the uh

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,039
our recent release is always here and

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,200
then there's

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,159
archives of our releases the top level

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,039
project

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,559
then older archives in the incubator

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,080
including from before incubation

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,039
i don't know how complete they are but

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,399
they're there

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:51,039
the update service which were

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:54,320
which after we released 4.1.8 should be

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
activated so that we can now properly

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,440
connect to

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:02,799
it this is what can connect now

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,600
this is the 30 day time period earlier

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,600
the mailing lists

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,080
and then i went through the templating

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,919
code

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,200
and ssi and how that's

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,200
you know similar to

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:39,840
what we have here

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:51,360
with all the server side includes we use

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:55,200
so that's just the review um

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,200
i'm interested anyone has any

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,480
any questions

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
um

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,440
okay so um

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,879
you look pedro's looking for a guide to

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:35,839
how to commit to

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:35,839
apache open office

00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,680
hopefully this is updated

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,839
yep

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,839
does that work for you

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:59,839
any any other questions any

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,040
by basics do you mean conversion basics

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:41,839
do you mean how to use subversion or

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,839
how to use subversion with open office

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:23,839
uh carl isn't isn't that

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:23,839
kind of

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,640
isn't that this page or is it something

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
else

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,680
the readme for the get has instructions

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:36,480
but it refers back to source right so

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
maybe that needs to be better

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:47,839
and the building probably should um

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,839
include more from the project wiki

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,040
it's great to see the conversation um

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,839
we're we're at time with the talk

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,839
um

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,079
y'all going to the pub later

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:53,839
