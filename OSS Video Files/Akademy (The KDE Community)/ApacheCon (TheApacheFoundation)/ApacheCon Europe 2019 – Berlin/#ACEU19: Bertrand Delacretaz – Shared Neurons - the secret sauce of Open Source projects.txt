Title: #ACEU19: Bertrand Delacretaz – Shared Neurons - the secret sauce of Open Source projects
Publication date: 2019-10-24
Playlist: ApacheCon Europe 2019 – Berlin
Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/shared-neurons-secret-sauce-open-source-projects

Open Source communities sometimes speak of Shared Neurons when great ideas come together as if sparked by a giant collective brain. Can we take inspiration from them and foster such neuron sharing in our teams? We will describe the tools and techniques used by successful Open Source projects to "put their brains together", by communicating openly and often, exposing concrete ideas early in prototype code, collaborating asynchronously and deliberately slowing things down to take advantage of unexpected Eureka moments.

Based on years of experiences in multiple Open Source projects, this talk will help you better understand what makes our communities so powerful and how to transpose this in your own teams.

thank you for being here it's a

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,879
if you're if you're Swiss it's lunchtime

00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:17,220
it's with if you're a good Swiss when

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,169
it's noon you go and eat that's the time

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,450
for that now we're shifting it a bit so

00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,410
thanks for being flexible it's a great

00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,509
pleasure to be here

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,160
apache khan is always a great conference

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:28,230
i've been to this venue actually a few

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,849
times for different conferences and i

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,529
love it

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,230
so my name is Burton delegate I'm a

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,690
principal scientist with Adobe in Basel

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,809
we have a on the office in Basel for

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,760
adobe experience manager i used to be on

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,369
the board of directors of apache for 10

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,150
years step down this year to leave space

00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:50,790
for younger people and this topic is

00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:56,489
chair neurons you'll find out what it

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:59,420
means hopefully as we as we go on this

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,549
is an ant obviously it's not a maven

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,400
it's it's an it's nice it's a nice

00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,950
animal but on its own it doesn't do much

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,740
it's a small thing it has a very small

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,720
brain and you will feel it what can you

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,900
do with that it's you know it's just an

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,240
ant but if you put a few of them

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,320
together on many of them together they

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
start to organize and do big things

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,730
quite incredible things if you look at a

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,520
bit at the big ants nest it's pretty

00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:33,950
complex and it works because of the

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:39,060
collaboration of these small animals and

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:42,120
with our community of a code motto we're

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,140
we a bit like that you know we have we

00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,330
have big or smaller communities but we

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,150
have communities or enough individuals

00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,870
in our projects and they do amazing

00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:57,540
things and I think things that we could

00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,729
not do on our own you know it's because

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,690
of the exchange of ideas the different

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,659
points of view

00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,190
the different cultures that are behind

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,099
our communities and our projects that

00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,110
that make them you know allow them to do

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,750
things that are bigger or much bigger

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:18,359
that what you could do if you were on on

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,329
your own this is me and a few friends on

00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:24,930
top of Kilimanjaro and it's a good

00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:28,260
illustration for this African proverb

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:32,400
if you want to go fast go alone if you

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,620
want to go far go together and some

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,090
people do climb Kilimanjaro on their own

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,880
I don't know if you know about Kilian

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,150
Jornet took like three hours something

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,130
our team took six days but we got there

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,290
and we not specific you know we're not

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,400
incredible athletes we just trained a

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,370
bit and it was hard but as a team you

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,740
know you can lean on the others when

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,410
when it's when it's tough for you and

00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,959
and exchange ideas of how to make things

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:06,630
happen and I think it's the same thing

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:09,920
happens in our projects this this term

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,540
of shared neurons I did not invent it I

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,330
remember it being used in the first

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,940
times in the in the cocoon community who

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,459
was who's from the app we have anyone

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,010
from Apache cocoon not in this room

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,200
Apache cocoon was a fantastic I mean

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,549
it's still in the community but it was

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,970
much more active in the year 2003-2004 a

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,400
very very active very balanced very

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,440
efficient community and that's where we

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,690
were using this term a lot of shared

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,940
neurons know putting our neurons

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,190
together putting our brains together to

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,360
create something that's bigger than than

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:53,130
what any of us could do and and this is

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,200
the love song part actually if you you

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,329
know love songs they always talk about

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,220
the same thing but they do it in

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,739
different way and and if you want to

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,140
compose a love song the trick is to find

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,140
how can I explain this thing that

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,060
everybody knows about in a new way and

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,610
I'm doing a bit like I'm a bit doing

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,829
that in my talks if you've been to two

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,530
if you heard some of our previous talks

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:19,049
it's maybe been 10 years or more that

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm talking about these things how do we

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:24,660
watch the magic of of Apache and

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,510
open-source communities what's you know

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,910
what are the ingredients that can allow

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,370
you to reproduce that in other settings

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,890
or help help you make your project work

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,200
better so it like in love songs I'm

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,950
saying the same things in in different

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,470
ways

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:44,030
and this share neurons is kind of trying

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,760
to find a new angle on the same thing

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,800
but we are geeks right so we want to we

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,350
won't need a definition of that I cannot

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,690
just yeah that's share neurons we have

00:04:52,350 --> 00:05:00,600
to try to explain what what it means so

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,520
what I mean by that is many brains

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,310
getting together to create a greater

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:10,830
whole and I think we we see that all the

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,470
time in our in our projects where

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,720
because of the rich discussions because

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,080
of the respectful ways in which you can

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,800
make your point or argue with someone on

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,020
technical basis and disagree nicely

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,750
disagree constructively and then in the

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,120
end it's you know like the if you look

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,460
at the the I'm not a brain specialist by

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,580
far but if you look at how how neurons

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,280
work there's a very large number of

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,850
neurons in our brains and they they talk

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,410
together a lot there's lots of inter

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:49,880
interconnections between these these

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:53,820
neurons quoting Wikipedia some some

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,270
types of neurons they have over thousand

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,060
dendritic branches so connections with

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,030
tens of thousands of other cells so they

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,610
talk a lot and they if you look at the

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,590
single neuron is probably not not

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,080
complex it's a pretty simple thing it's

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,450
it's a bit like an ant it's it can do

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,040
something pretty simple but when you put

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,890
many of them together that's when it

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,660
starts getting interesting and I think

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:24,420
we are reproducing that in our

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:27,140
communities many times which means that

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,590
it's really about communication or our

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,260
individual brains

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,080
there's many very clever people in our

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,450
projects but even then our brains are

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,240
limited and we tend to have one angle

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,580
one way of seeing things and it's very

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,810
beneficial to be you know to have other

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,630
people expressing ideas in a different

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,790
way of or expressing their own points of

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,300
views which are different and it's true

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,430
coming

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,419
occasion that you can benefit from that

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,099
you know if you if your have different

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,750
different ideas of different pieces of

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,970
the solution and you don't talk together

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,750
it doesn't happen you don't you don't

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,569
find a solution it's by establishing

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:14,039
good communication that it can it can

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:16,080
work and really that's how we can have

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:22,860
many brains get together to create this

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,800
dis create a whole but we gigs right so

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,110
we need a we need two concrete examples

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,139
of that I cannot just tell you I it's

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,960
just happening yet trust me I think it's

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:37,229
it's probably useful that I show you one

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,139
example it's a pretty simple example

00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:43,889
actually there's tons of them in our

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,139
communities this is just one one pretty

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,409
small feature of the Apache Felix

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,349
project doesn't matter exactly what it

00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:54,509
does what I'm getting at is the way the

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,750
conversation is happening and the way

00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,300
different people are you know providing

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,979
different aspects of the solution so

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,210
this is about doing configuration

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:08,490
interpolation in configurations you know

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,699
you have a config and you have a special

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,710
notation dollar bracket variable name

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,560
bracket and this means replace this

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,210
value dynamically whatever it's really

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,139
not important what it does but you have

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,419
David Bush it starts in the item one

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,729
saying hey guys I've been working on

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,069
this module recently I have some ideas

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,139
about how we can do that so I have some

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,820
some initial code I put it in the

00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,940
repository you can have a look at it and

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,640
I welcome feedback and he's doing that

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,579
tree early he's not saying hey guys I

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,740
finished this module you can love it

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:45,690
please love it and please bless it and

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,120
we'll release it and we don't know he's

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,399
at the beginning of the process he says

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,329
I have something but it's I'm still open

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,010
to suggestions

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:56,640
and I think that that's the starting

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,680
point being you know exposing your ideas

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,620
early and being open to two

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,440
contributions and then number two that's

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,480
Jay be your body stern of way saying oh

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,600
it's fantastic I was thinking about

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,759
doing the same thing I did something

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,649
similar in a different project so maybe

00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,019
we can put already ideas together and

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,639
you already see something bigger

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,190
emerging you know instead of just

00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,870
someone david Borchardt is brilliant is

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,899
one of my colleagues is a brilliant

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,699
engineer but still having someone else

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,939
here you have the same problem I've did

00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:33,420
it maybe you can you can share our ideas

00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:35,970
then number three number two is me I'm

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,089
I'm often quite picky on naming things

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,310
I think naming things right helps a lot

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,709
in designer say hey David you know this

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,410
is usually called interpolation and I

00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,149
provided Wikipedia link to that because

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,029
we're geeks and we need to have facts

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,680
too based on reasoning upon so I say you

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,319
know I'm making a suggestion on the name

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,579
this doesn't make me a hardcore geek in

00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:59,490
that problem but it's a useful

00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:03,779
contribution and then number four you

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:07,379
have GOG Hensler who's being very

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:10,259
precise discussing details about how how

00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:13,170
should we do the exact syntax you know

00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,360
taking a totally different angle on the

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,699
discussion and also making a useful

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,449
contribution and and with fact you know

00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:23,730
with strong arguments on why it thinks

00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:27,899
we should do it in in this different way

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,959
then you have constant Ziggler also

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,689
making pretty deep considerations how

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,430
you could do that and then in the end

00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,829
number six you have David saying oh yeah

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,860
okay thanks thanks for your suggestions

00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:44,430
I renamed the module I suggested I have

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,110
incorporated JB's ideas about the

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,589
framework system property based off

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,110
whatever you know and and I think that

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,480
it's a great example even it says if

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,449
it's a small module in this projects a

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,629
great example of a greater whole

00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:02,689
emerging for this respectful

00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:05,040
constructive and open discussion where

00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:07,139
different people take different angles

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,079
at the thing say oh I think the name

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,589
could be better another syntax could be

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,600
improved

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,519
I have suggestions and and that's very

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,980
powerful you have the link you can if

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,389
you want to follow the discussion you

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,129
have the link to see the details

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:24,420
and this whole thing took 90 days

00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,579
sometimes people say yeah you know the

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,999
Apache process it's so slow I need to

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:33,899
agree with everybody takes ages and and

00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:36,329
90 days it can be seen as a lot you know

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,259
if I do it this alone I could whip it up

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:42,449
in two days and it's good okay it works

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,639
in five years or ten years you might be

00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:47,429
happy that you took these 90 days to get

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,170
this design right meaning you know it

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,480
doesn't bother you anymore it's it's

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,850
clean people like it it's understandable

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,459
the names are good and so on so I think

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,709
we're trading the speed here for the

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,470
quality of the result and it takes time

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,779
which means it's a slow discussion it

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,759
you know maybe if during these 90 days

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,649
people have gone on vacation or someone

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,259
has been sick for a few days it's

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,299
interrupted but still you you go get

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,309
together in a synchronous fashion and do

00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:18,689
something that's very effective in the

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:21,059
end also have a counter example I'm a

00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:23,970
Masai clay I'm a cyclist and a cycling

00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,089
fan so that just by example that's my

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,919
counter example the first invention that

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:32,429
led to the modern bicycle is a

00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,379
velocipede in 1817 a pretty clunky thing

00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,540
which was not comfortable at all

00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,209
you know it's wooden wheels so it's

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,869
quite painful to ride and then it took

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:45,329
53 years until the high wheeler was

00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:49,230
created with spokes meaning that the

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:51,149
wheel has some you know can do some what

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,669
you call a dampening of the of the of

00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,249
the bumps in the road but then and then

00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,989
pedals which are more efficient but then

00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:00,059
if you have pedals on a small wheel it's

00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:02,489
too slow you know it's like it kids we

00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,619
kids bike didn't work so yeah that's put

00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:06,959
a bigger wheel and it worked but it was

00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:11,360
kind of dangerous you know going

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,889
downhill with that is a bit tricky so

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,259
okay people said we should do something

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,660
better and it took 15 years to go to the

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:21,629
safety bicycle which is very similar to

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,669
what we have today a bit heavier maybe

00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:27,600
none that langoustine eyes Cipollini

00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:29,519
which were the frame weighs one kilo but

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,220
still the basic design was here but it

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,800
took in total 53 years plus 50

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,210
years to get that my point is that if

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,010
these people have had the communication

00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:43,680
tools that we have today it might have

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,050
been much faster because the exchange of

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,310
ideas could be could be faster and I

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,170
think we should take advantage of that

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,040
and and you know really use these tools

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:56,010
in an efficient way

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:59,010
we geeks so we need to we would like to

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:03,540
find out how do we do that concretely so

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:05,340
I have a number of principles that we

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,840
can apply in our conversations in our

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,870
projects to make that happen

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,600
and it's based on the on the observation

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,910
that the neurons talk a lot like we saw

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,170
before a neuron can have thousands of

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,510
connections to other ones

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,700
so there's a lot lots of conversation

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:26,820
going on in our brain that makes this

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:28,710
this work so the the the principles that

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm going to describe are really all

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:39,060
about communication that's that's what

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:42,930
makes this tick and I will try to avoid

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,000
speaking of tools exactly which tool you

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,250
use to implement this does not matter

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,930
it's the principles that that make the

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,580
difference and then you can various

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,810
groups might have different tools to do

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:57,920
the same thing the first principle is to

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,600
establish a constant flow of information

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,520
if you if you're working in a large

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,800
organization there's often very

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,660
structured communication communication

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,850
has to go through the managers and

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,190
bubble up and then bubble down again

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,890
it's incredibly slow and it's incredibly

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,420
painful in our projects we try to

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,400
establish this constant flow of

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,500
information where you have this big

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,870
stream of information coming at you all

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,970
the time which means you need to learn

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,650
how to cope with that if if you are

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,140
active in our you know in one of our

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,730
busy projects there's a lot of

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,010
information coming in every day

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,120
lots of mails or lots of get tickets or

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,700
you know whatever

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,950
lots of notifications that and you have

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,350
to learn to to filter that and to cope

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,360
with it but the key aspect of that is

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,460
that it allows everybody to get the same

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,930
information you have this flow of

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,570
information you can

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,810
select whatever is relevant for you but

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,730
it enables everybody to get the same

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,339
information and that's extremely

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,370
powerful it means people can work on the

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,970
same on the same you know on same ideas

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,760
and and a not be segregated to just one

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,910
thing as long as it's in the in the flow

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,730
of the project and also what's important

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,440
is that there is one flow you don't have

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,110
to look in ten different places in

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,459
Apache projects the usual rule is that

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,200
everything has to happen on the dev

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,940
mailing list so if you want to know

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,980
something it has to be on the dev

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,470
mailing list again they can be different

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:30,420
tools but it's very important to have

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,980
one place to look at and not 25 the

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,230
second principle is to talk to the

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:39,750
project of course it's faster and often

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,870
easier it seems easier to talk directly

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:47,010
to someone the the typical question that

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,750
I see is is who should I talk to to -

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,930
for this problem that's the wrong

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,400
question you should talk to the project

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,500
imagine you're having a stand-up meeting

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,350
all the time and that's what you can do

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,240
with these communication channels if you

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,770
have a one channel for your project

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
that's where the discussion is happening

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,880
if you have a question you're sending it

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,709
to the to this channel even though you

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,900
know that it's may be shown that's going

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,689
to answer that is the one who knows but

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,069
still people others will be aware of the

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,970
questions of the dialogue that's going

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,500
on and that's very important and and

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,990
what's interesting is that if you work

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,910
like that this you don't need any stand

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,939
up meetings because the information is

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,340
flowing and everybody can get it so if

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,500
you have the luxury if to be co-located

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,150
it it's probably good to still do a

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,910
short standard meeting if you can do

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,150
that but it's not required if this

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,880
information is flowing via the digital

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,400
channels but it's very important to talk

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,920
to the project avoid direct discussions

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,120
or if it's important has to be you know

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,540
integrated in the projects discussion

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,540
channel

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,499
the next principle is to share early and

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,079
share often we offer will we also say

00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,059
release early release often for code and

00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,820
I think for ideas it's the same thing if

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:12,190
you share your ideas early likely so

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,229
David do in our example he was sharing

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,649
his idea was not finished you said

00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:20,019
obvious idea I would like to do that

00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:22,929
expose it very early helps others give

00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,329
feedback and maybe it will shape your

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,209
ideas a bit differently this your term

00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:30,219
it mounts if you want to build a thing

00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,979
like that you cannot build it in one

00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:35,829
piece it has to be built in very small

00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:37,959
increments you know one one termite

00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:40,029
brings a very small piece of it and then

00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:41,919
another one and it grows and I think

00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:45,519
already ideas can grow in the same way

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,799
by having very small contributions from

00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:52,119
many different people and then emerge

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:54,879
let then let something bigger emerge so

00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:57,549
sharing our ideas early sharing them

00:18:54,879 --> 00:19:00,789
often allows others to give feedback and

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:06,639
to shape the the idea as its as its

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:09,789
growing I wonder if anyone in the in the

00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:12,309
room knows what this is or maybe I

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,279
should ask that in French scary folk

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:20,889
evangelist are gonna see shadow this is

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:24,190
the shadows when I was much younger this

00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:27,219
was on TV and it's it's a crazy bunch of

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,519
crazy animals it's a cartoon that that

00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:33,279
would air on the or ort F the French

00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:35,019
television in the early evening like

00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:40,299
four three minutes or two minutes very

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:42,729
short cartoons very crazy and these are

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,859
animals that are there on a broken

00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:47,799
planet and I would like to move to the

00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:50,049
next planet which looks much nicer and

00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:53,559
the the prophets of shadow Co which is

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:58,269
their chief scientist has computed that

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,959
they have 0.02 percent of chances to

00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,959
succeed

00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:04,149
so he says okay so we should fail many

00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:06,129
times and then eventually we'll get to

00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:08,100
the end of the set and then we'll find

00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:10,620
this zero two percent which

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,720
we will succeed so let's fail a lot and

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,400
they're failing they're just pumping to

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,130
try to get to the next planet and

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,330
they're failing all the time and he says

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,550
you know the more we fail the more

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,010
likely we are to succeed I'm not sure

00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:25,470
that's how we should approach things but

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,940
still it's very important to allow

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:32,250
mistakes you know and to be to be open

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,980
to be welcoming to someone making an

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,640
honest mistake in the in project or or

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,800
or having ugly code if you saw the the

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,800
movies the fun movie screening yesterday

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,350
evening ROI feeling was saying that it

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,750
he was amazed to see when he was seeing

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,910
the code of other people said that's not

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,010
as you know I was me the shame of my

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,740
code but I see that that code is not

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,620
fantastic either so I have no problem

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,630
showing my code you know and and P we

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,450
should not blame people if we see code

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,280
that we don't like say rather suggest

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,590
something better we can do this

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,110
differently here's how we do it and give

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,790
some code that that explains how how you

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,310
want to do it so I think it's very

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,560
important to be friendly towards

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,660
mistakes and also there are some

00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,270
cultures where it's very hard to make

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,190
mistakes in public when if you do open

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,230
source you will make mistakes in public

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,690
because you know everything happens on

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,820
public place or discussion channels or

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,380
your mistakes will be visible if you

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,950
search for my mistakes in the Apache

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,900
archives you will find tons of them so

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,100
and for in some cultures it's it's

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,170
something that people are not

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,630
comfortable with so we have to be

00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,250
welcoming and encouraging people you

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,370
know telling people explicitly that

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,520
making mistakes is ok and and you know

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,690
every mistake can be can be fixed

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,790
especially if it's software you can you

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:59,010
can rewrite it better so that that's

00:21:53,790 --> 00:22:00,990
also an important concept the next

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,750
principle is that code speaks louder

00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:09,570
than than text then you know that than

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:11,880
prose sometimes we love to write when we

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,730
want to explain an idea we write a long

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,740
text and you know trying to explain how

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,020
we are we planning to do it and the

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,480
different elements and then you end up

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,119
with a very long email

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,460
that pretty much nobody will read we

00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,759
don't have time or when I see an email

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,529
like that you know I'm kind of

00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,499
discouraged or or I rarely have the time

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:35,809
to really dig into it if you can express

00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:37,820
your idea with code do do a crappy

00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:40,489
prototype something that you know

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,220
expresses your idea it's so much more

00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:45,169
precise people can run your code even if

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,109
it's ugly if even if it's not finished

00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:50,029
if it's just a partial solution it will

00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:53,659
express your idea in a much more precise

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:56,179
way than a pile of text I'm not saying

00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,739
you don't need specs I'm not saying you

00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,929
don't need documentation it's good to

00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:02,989
have that but even for documentation I

00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:05,059
prefer doing overview documentation that

00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:07,279
explains the concepts and then the

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:09,259
details can be explained by tests test

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,470
code you know readable test code is the

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:14,450
best detailed specification because it

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,970
if it runs you know that it you know it

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,450
works and it's precise so in many cases

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,730
we should try to avoid too long

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,159
Congress too long textual or too long

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,940
conversations and write code even if

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:32,869
it's you know temporary or or ugly or

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,580
not finished it will make it much easier

00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,359
for people to understand what you're

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,359
what you're about

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,200
another key principle in our projects is

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,830
to enable these kinds of slow

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,750
discussions in our example in the

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:57,049
example that I was showing it took 90

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,429
days between the initial disc idea to

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,530
David saying okay I've been

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:02,929
incorporating the ideas here's what I

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,270
consider to be a pretty finished version

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:07,490
of my my module and it's a pretty small

00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,760
thing you know just replacing variables

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,640
in the config that's not nothing big so

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,070
you could say that's way too long and as

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,500
I was saying this I'm sure that this

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,120
design is much better than David would

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,790
have done on his own in one day even

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,030
though is a very bright guy so I think

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:28,250
the the way you set up your project your

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:31,100
collaboration tools has to enable this

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,620
kind of slow discussions meaning that if

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,840
you're away for a week or two you come

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,179
back you should be able to restart you

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,950
know where you left and you shouldn't

00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:41,720
you shouldn't have to have shouldn't

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,790
require to have meetings with people

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,799
will take a lot of time and will bore

00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,549
people to death just to get information

00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:51,110
it should be in the system and for

00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:53,510
example if you're working with tickets

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,429
get tickets or JIRA whatever I said I

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,710
wouldn't I was not going to mention

00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,350
tools but to give you an example of what

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,750
I mean you know the history of the

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,429
conversation is here you can go back and

00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,590
pick up maybe ask a few detailed

00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,309
questions if you understand but really

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:12,440
you have to enable this asynchronous

00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:14,900
brainstorming that's happening here it's

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,690
dark def is not here but it was here

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,570
yesterday who told me that I think it's

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,059
the IETF one of the standards

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,830
organizations they do have meetings they

00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:27,530
will meet for two three days and discuss

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,900
topics intentionally they do not make

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,330
decisions at this time they say okay we

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,549
discussed the issues we discussed the

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,919
possible options but we postpone the

00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:39,760
decision to give people more time to

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,380
reflect and also for people who are

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,809
working in language that is not their

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,030
native language we're working in English

00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,919
my mother tongue is French maybe in

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,890
quick discussions I don't understand all

00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,559
the subtleties if it's in writing I can

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,240
take my time and understand clearly and

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,190
reply you know with

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,930
better background so I think it's very

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,480
important to enable these slow

00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:05,120
discussions there's a tendency these

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,540
days to use chat tools to communicate

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,340
between engineers it's cool it's useful

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,040
but you have to realize that chat is a

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,870
here-now medium if you're using you know

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,150
slack or HipChat or these kind of things

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,820
it's great it's very quick and efficient

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,980
but if you come to three days later one

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,730
week a that's very hard to make sense of

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,810
what's going on so you have to you know

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,640
enable a channel where you can have

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,700
these flow discussions for the important

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:37,940
things and take your time to do it in a

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:41,690
nice design this is the last of these

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:44,270
these principles which I'm calling quote

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,880
precisely so that the most obvious

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:49,010
example is in email if you get an email

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,620
you know you get a block like that and

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:55,040
you reply we stop quoting and saying

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,740
okay or +1 what are you exactly you're

00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,840
saying is okay what are you exactly plus

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,610
warning you know maybe in this block of

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,400
text there's like 10 different concepts

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:07,210
and if you say +1 okay are you accepting

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,520
all 10 or just one it's very imprecise

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,440
but it's not only it's not only an email

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,730
that you're quoting

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,970
something that's been said when you're

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,770
commenting on code it's very good to

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,020
have a tool where you can put you know

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,760
position you comment very precisely on

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,340
which line of code you are commenting on

00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:29,660
if you are discussing something in the

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:32,750
ticket you can use quoting mechanisms or

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,150
symbols to express exactly what you are

00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,070
replying to if you are having an

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,780
in-person conversation you will have

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,550
lots of back-and-forth you might

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,320
interrupt someone say I have a question

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,690
can I can ask a question if you're

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,750
getting that in written form it's you

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,400
have to indicate exactly you know which

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,660
part of the discussion you're replying

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,090
to so this is the basic principle is the

00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,560
old-style using it quoting it doesn't

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,110
have to be exactly like that

00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,810
but the principle is that when you have

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,550
a discussion you being very precise on

00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:08,320
which parts of the discussion you are

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,320
you are dressing in your reply

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:16,409
and I think these are the the tools the

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,390
principles that will allow you to create

00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:20,370
this share neuron environment where you

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,710
can share your ideas with and create

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,289
something that's greater than than than

00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,750
the pots or gratings and then the brains

00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:29,520
of the people who are involved if you

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,220
establish this constant flow of

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,830
information to allow everybody to get

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,980
the same information or filter out what

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,659
they need what they don't need to know

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,029
which parts of the conversation they

00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,549
need to participate in the second

00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:46,380
picture was the talking to the project

00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:48,270
instead of talking one-to-one with

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,890
people you talk on the channel where

00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,559
everybody in the project can see what's

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,510
going on be aware of the discussions be

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,940
aware of the topics that are going on

00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:00,659
it's very important the third image was

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,120
the term it bounds was sharing early and

00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,220
sharing often as soon as you have an

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,169
idea that's you know that that's

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,890
understandable you should share it even

00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:13,380
do say vague idea I think we should do

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,970
that it's perfectly okay and do it in a

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,429
constructive way so people can provide

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,360
feedback and and you know steer shape

00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:23,460
what you are collectively creating the

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,070
fourth image was the shadows who are

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:30,330
failing a lot in you know trying to

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:32,190
eventually succeed which sometimes we do

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,559
that without without realising but I

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,600
think it's really good to be welcoming

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,539
to mistakes so that people can feel safe

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,399
to in an environment where they are

00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:45,029
allowed to make mistakes and then people

00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:48,090
can see them and constructively help fix

00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:51,029
them so that the result is better then

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:53,070
we had the the code speaks louder saying

00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,539
that don't write too much you know as

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,700
soon as you can write some code it's

00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,070
going to express your ideas much more

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,350
precisely then we had the slow

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,570
discussions which are very important use

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,510
tools that enable you to have these slow

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,850
discussions if you have to decide

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,429
something in a meeting that's often much

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,380
less much less efficient

00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:15,390
sometimes you okay there's a deadline

00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,880
you have to make a decision but if you

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,860
can it's much better to take the time

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,110
for the idea the good ideas to emerge

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,900
and the last picture

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,940
was quoting precisely I didn't explain

00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,460
this picture actually these people are

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,620
using sign language sign language does

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,110
work for to communicate and it's great

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:37,049
it's a great tool it's not as precise or

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:41,160
subtle as spoken language and I think if

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:43,020
you're quoting imprecisely you you know

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,690
you're kind of reverting back to a less

00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,120
efficient language but it's hard to

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:51,179
express things so I think by using these

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,160
principles we can enable is this sharing

00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,669
of neurons in our projects and create

00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:59,220
greater things I'm seeing that in action

00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:02,400
in in in the open source projects where

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,820
I'm active and then I think it's

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,770
important to focus on that and don't be

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,150
when new tools emerge you know we had

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,299
the number of new tools for

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:14,220
communications recently it's cool but

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,370
you have to put them in perspective do

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,470
do they are does does the way we use

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:22,500
these tools enable these principles and

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,360
maybe it will help you define guidelines

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,130
or define recommendations for how people

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,410
should should communicate in your

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:35,220
projects so that's really my conclusion

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:38,070
so that using these principles will

00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,200
allow you to put the brains of your

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,660
teams together to create a greater whole

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,200
and it's I think we're seeing that in a

00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:48,360
fantastic ways in many of our projects

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,120
so it's it's very encouraging but we

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,350
have to keep on our toes as

00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,770
communication tools and practices evolve

00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,630
too to keep these principles alive so we

00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:01,890
have I think we have a bit of time for

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:06,410
questions please five minutes yeah so if

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,410
there are questions yes

00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,380
we should take our time and we're not

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,900
gonna do it at that um but I have a

00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,880
teensy bone to pick with one of them

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,580
okay they want the school that you have

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,160
labeled code speaks louder

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,650
I completely agree on the principle

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,230
behind it but I have a bit of a problem

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:34,900
because I am not a software developer

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:39,490
I'm an interaction designer one of the

00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:42,130
few and although sometimes I submit code

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,430
patches my main contribution is of a

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,860
different kind right I provide

00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,810
prototypes yes design of interfaces and

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,880
also I do research with the users of

00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:56,500
software to understand what they need

00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,060
right say there are things that I can

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,520
provide that are the equivalent to that

00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:03,460
code but I'm just wondering if it's time

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,980
for us to be a little bit more perhaps

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,480
open or inclusive and we label this code

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,660
is speaks louder to something else

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,550
that's a great point

00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,970
yes thank you very much that's a great

00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:18,460
point so I'm standing here with my

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:22,090
background as a coder and and in your

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,520
observation is is really perfect so

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:28,390
maybe I should say artifacts speak

00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,340
louder or concrete concrete something

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,170
yeah that that's a great suggestion I

00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,150
agree totally so in your case I suppose

00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,700
what you're saying is that for you

00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,530
providing a prototype speaks much louder

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,970
than explaining what you're going to do

00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,840
and that's probably what you do in your

00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,760
job so thank you yeah

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,190
examples yeah concrete example speaks

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
louder than then blonde fool thank you

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,110
very much

00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,490
that's great observer it's the first

00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,930
time I do this talk so it's great to

00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,860
have this kind of feedback I can improve

00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:59,340
it for next time

00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:00,700
Thanks more questions or commands Sean

00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,300
yeah I agree

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:10,240
great talk the one on allowing mistakes

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:12,399
to me that's one of the most that's one

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,700
of the biggest barriers to getting

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,540
people to join your project cap is an

00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,770
unfriendly environment where you know

00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,119
people are afraid to come in I know

00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:25,149
myself personally

00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,429
have been hesitant to to join projects

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:30,669
for that very reason I suspect that's

00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:34,690
what's behind you know somewhere in that

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:36,789
diversity and inclusion situation that

00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,789
has to be accounted for yep in my

00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:42,789
opinion totally agree yeah I think that

00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:47,409
and I think that's it's a challenge

00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:48,879
because as you as you become an expert

00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,069
like you know if you start an open

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,200
source project the fact to you you will

00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:55,419
become the expert on that after a few

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,220
months or years or whatever and it's

00:34:55,419 --> 00:35:02,140
it's it's difficult for newcomers to

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,849
feel okay say you know I'm working with

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,329
these guys and they are the there are

00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:09,759
the experts in the in their field so Who

00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:13,359
am I to suggest make suggestions to them

00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:15,700
so I think that I think it's on us to to

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,819
make a constant effort to to allow that

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,849
and maybe also be be open now about our

00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:24,730
own mistakes because I know I do many of

00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:28,299
those so so it's a it's really yeah

00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:32,230
making making the mistakes a natural

00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:34,150
part of the process and just not you

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,009
know being being rude on the people

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,559
doing mistakes or whatever and then as

00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:41,980
you saying that there's the additional

00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:45,099
culture way some cultures some

00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,730
personalities or don't don't work I

00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:52,630
think again I don't want to to do cheap

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:55,119
psychology but I was reading that people

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,880
who are optimistic I I am an optimistic

00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,589
in general when something wrong happens

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,690
I tend to to think it's not my fault I

00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:07,269
tend to try to find external causes you

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,849
know I was late oh my my alarm clock

00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:12,279
broke down and whereas people who are

00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:16,119
pessimistic will tend to take that more

00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:18,309
on them so I'm late as terrible and you

00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,220
know the so the personality the culture

00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:23,410
they do the group's you used to work

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,759
with will influence that and yeah I

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,369
agree that that's a constant therefore

00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:34,169
that we should make to be welcoming to

00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:41,949
mistakes more questions or comments

00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:44,589
one in the back yes so learning from the

00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:46,419
mistakes so there are multiple kind of

00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:48,789
mistakes one is just the code mistake

00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:52,029
right that's yes easy that and there are

00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,979
other mistakes when the project doesn't

00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:57,329
follow the apache way or there are

00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:59,499
mistakes on this level and when i'm

00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:02,769
interested to learn these kind of

00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:05,589
mistakes and i prefer to learn from the

00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:08,229
other mistakes rise before different

00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:10,839
right but i don't know if there are any

00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:12,130
easy way to learn this part of the

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:14,319
history of the Apaches of their

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,999
foundation mmm-hmm you mentioned that

00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:17,529
you were part of the board and i'm

00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:21,339
pretty sure that you had a lot of

00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:23,439
problems which are not published or

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:25,959
published in the board meetings but i

00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:27,939
think it's we have a lot of

00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:31,209
documentation about what should be

00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:35,229
followed but we have no examples that

00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:38,289
right what should be avoided yes i think

00:37:35,229 --> 00:37:42,179
i think the examples are the key here

00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:44,969
and i would encourage all the the apache

00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:47,499
contributors members committers whatever

00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:49,900
write your stories when you have a good

00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:52,539
story or a story of a failure that

00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,939
turned into success please write write

00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,439
about that we have multiple blogs in the

00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,719
apache software foundation there's a

00:37:56,439 --> 00:38:00,880
foundation blog which welcomes guest

00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,559
posts there's there's project blogs

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,539
there might be your own blog or Twitter

00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,689
or whatever I think is very important

00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:09,459
too I think the stories and the examples

00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:11,469
will will help with that I agree with

00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:14,380
you that there's you know many mistakes

00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:16,839
are being made every month maybe at

00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,140
least and then we we should learn from

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,269
them so I think the the documentation or

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,519
more rules will not help for that in

00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:26,469
general the rules are here and we try to

00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,359
have a minimal amount of rules I think

00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:30,219
that's good but then it's the stories

00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:33,219
which will help help with that so and

00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:36,009
that's like if you if you're in an

00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:39,009
incubating project I was a mentor for

00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:41,079
Apache flags and when flags graduated we

00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:43,539
wrote a small story of the incubation

00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,100
you know just a timeline what what when

00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:46,930
where what when less why

00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,880
and I think that's useful and and it

00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,980
stays around that's something that other

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,450
projects can look at so I think that

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,040
everybody in the community can

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:58,150
contribute to that by writing stories

00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:04,260
about yeah mistakes or how things happen

00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:04,260
and how you can learn from that yes loss

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,920
so what loss is asking what from the

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,080
things that I mentioned what the what's

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,210
the hardest or the most difficult to

00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:27,700
learn one thing that I that I struggle a

00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,040
lot in the teams that I'm involved in so

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,780
as I said my my so my title you know

00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,940
Toby's principal scientist it's kind of

00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,980
an internal consultant so I consult with

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,650
teams on architecture topics but also on

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,230
community and collaboration topics and

00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,420
one thing that that that I see group

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:47,170
struggling a lot is the the constant

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:49,450
flow of information it feels it feels so

00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,340
easy you know just say okay don't talk

00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,280
to people directly or if you do that

00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:57,190
send a small summary to the group's

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,200
digital channel and people are reluctant

00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,400
to do that or they don't care or they or

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,310
they are lazy I don't know I don't know

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,130
what it is but it's it's for me it's I

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,440
was looking at all so we are using slack

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,900
internally to collaborate I was looking

00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,410
at our slack statistics recently and the

00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:16,060
number of direct messages is huge you

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,450
have you have a line that shows the

00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,340
messages exchanged on channels so we

00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,140
charge which can be these kinds of

00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,820
constant for information and then you

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,220
have a line for the direct message it's

00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,320
like I don't know 20 times 30 times

00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,940
larger

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,890
people tend seem to have a natural

00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,870
tendency to talk directly to others

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,000
maybe because they don't want to expose

00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,230
they are afraid of making mistakes in

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,420
discussing I don't know I don't know

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,700
what it is but that's where I see I'm

00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,220
often struggling when trying to steer

00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:49,120
projects in that direction thank you for

00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,980
the question so next thing is lunch I

00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,630
think we are eager to move to that stage

00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,990
thank you for being here I'll be around

00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:02,580
until tomorrow afternoon so feel free to

00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:07,750
if you have more questions and thanks

00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,750
