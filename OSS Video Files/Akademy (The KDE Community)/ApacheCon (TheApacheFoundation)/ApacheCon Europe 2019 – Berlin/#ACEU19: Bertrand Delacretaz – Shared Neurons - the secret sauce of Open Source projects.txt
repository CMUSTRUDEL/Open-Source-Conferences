Open Source communities sometimes speak of Shared Neurons when great ideas come together as if sparked by a giant collective brain. Can we take inspiration from them and foster such neuron sharing in our teams? We will describe the tools and techniques used by successful Open Source projects to "put their brains together", by communicating openly and often, exposing concrete ideas early in prototype code, collaborating asynchronously and deliberately slowing things down to take advantage of unexpected Eureka moments.

Based on years of experiences in multiple Open Source projects, this talk will help you better understand what makes our communities so powerful and how to transpose this in your own teams.
