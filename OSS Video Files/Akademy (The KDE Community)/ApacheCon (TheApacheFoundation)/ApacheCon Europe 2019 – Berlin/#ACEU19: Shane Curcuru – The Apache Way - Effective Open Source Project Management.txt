Title: #ACEU19: Shane Curcuru – The Apache Way - Effective Open Source Project Management
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: ApacheCon Europe 2019 – Berlin
Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/apache-way-effective-open-source-project-management

The Apache Way is a set of behaviors and techniques that anyone - organizations and individuals alike - can use to be more effective at working in distributed communities.  Open source does not necessarily mean open development - and true community-led open development 
is where the fun starts when working in FOSS!

This is an interactive review of the core behaviors used by Apache projects to help them stay healthy and productive over the long term.  While these behaviors are often required at the ASF, they are valuable to any collaborative project where the contributors are distributed across companies, continents, and experiences.

Takeaways

Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of practical actions they can take to help improve their own open source experience, and how to help their communities succeed together.  These are easy to adapt, proven behaviors that are documented parts of the Apache Way as practiced in all Apache projects.

thank you thank you so welcome to this

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,049
is part of the community track in most

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,770
of our conferences the Apache Way is

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,390
something we talk about a lot and I

00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,939
thought it was a it's such a big concept

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,800
that I think the description here is a

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,990
lot more relevant for what we want to

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,749
try and express which is this is an

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,040
effective way to manage your open-source

00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:35,070
projects something the ASF is pioneered

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,420
so what really is the Apache way I just

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,630
said it's pretty complex and there are a

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,090
lot of topics well I would put to you

00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,920
that it's a set of behaviors the way we

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,110
behave and practices that we work with

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,840
together developed at the Apache

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,660
Software Foundation and designed the

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,600
purpose really is to promote long lived

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,350
projects community-based projects our

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,410
course by focusing on stable governance

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,520
governance how we decide things and

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:06,810
encouraging and drawing in new

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,329
contributors so these are the little bit

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,189
of the behind like the why we have all

00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,049
these sort of things you might not have

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,880
thought of before or we ask you to do

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,710
votes a certain way it's because we're

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,929
looking for long live projects and the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,619
way you do that is you get new people to

00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:23,939
contribute and since we're at Apache

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,899
connick and say these behaviors are

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,880
really required expected of all Apache

00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,890
projects now a number of other

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,350
foundations have adopted many of our

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,210
practices and they sort of look to these

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,039
as guidelines that they either do or

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,710
don't use but we expect that all

00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:46,889
projects will be working this way so how

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,409
do we get here and how is this important

00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:51,929
to our project so a lot of traditional

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,060
Apache way projects or excuse me a lot

00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:55,770
of a traditional Apache way talks like

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,340
this we've been giving them at almost a

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,929
free Apache con talk about how the

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,219
foundation was created as a corporation

00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:07,220
to provide a legal shield the history of

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:10,229
how we built PMC's and how we have the

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,150
projects as separate and of course the

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,709
history of how we've developed these

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,480
behaviors because of course the Apache

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,510
Way has changed over time

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,360
but how important is all of that history

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,959
from 20 years ago now more than 20 years

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,420
ago now today is that what you're here

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,900
for a lot of that is from Lars as talked

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,750
yesterday and from our website I'm not

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,780
gonna do that what I want to do is talk

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,790
about the simple things that you can do

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,220
to better work with in apache projects

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,010
the actual behaviors and techniques you

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,959
can use to be effective and if you're

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,230
joining the ASF or if you're already in

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,299
an Apache project to work with our

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,310
projects well and I'll go into a little

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,560
bit of the the why is behind the

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,900
behaviors but some of those are so

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,579
detailed and there are many you know

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,629
what if this what if that were that when

00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,549
we what we've done in each of those

00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,159
cases and here's how we mean it made

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:07,629
that decision I'll do some of those

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,329
along the way but a lot of that it's

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,950
it's a much bigger process than we have

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,900
time for unfortunately here today in

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:20,680
Berlin so we also know that open-source

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,030
is participation right but it's it's

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,389
open source for all sharing we're all

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,410
working together so I have a list a menu

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:32,590
here of five kinds of behaviors that are

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,840
important to the apache way so community

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,629
over code which we all talk about all

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,010
the time there's merit recognizing your

00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:44,650
work open development which we use for

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,040
everything really as much as we possibly

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,879
can

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,829
how we make decisions decisions making

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,919
consensus voting things like that and of

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,919
course communications and while we're

00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,970
communicating in one way here together

00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,040
the most normal way that we're

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,599
communicating together is by I'm doing

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,609
this and you're doing the same thing on

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,340
your laptop right now as I can see some

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,980
people are doing so this is a

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,780
participation part of our talk I'm not

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,239
gonna choose where we go next

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,230
there is an obvious choice but I'm gonna

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,060
leave the choice up somebody on the

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,280
audience and preferably not a board

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,769
member or vice president and who's out

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,449
here so please someone where should we

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,840
go next where do you want to hear about

00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,840
first

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,250
don't make me do a song and dance and

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,760
tell more dad jokes because that'll just

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,270
be embarrassing no there's an obvious

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,270
choice here

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,730
what say again

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,139
community oh okay well let's start at

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:49,370
the start with community community /

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:51,050
code but the pink flamingos which are

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,740
one of my favorite animals besides cats

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,530
of course community is such a broad term

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:02,419
what do we what do we mean in the

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:04,310
context of the Apache way so working on

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,300
independent open-source projects where

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:11,140
we're working on our laptops online in a

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,400
distributed way we don't live together

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,330
some of us work together but most of us

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,220
don't we often don't know each other

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,680
we've never met the people who we hope

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,550
we may be working with regularly on a

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,560
project for years we've never met them

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,020
we only know people through the work on

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,770
our project or perhaps at conferences

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:38,030
but that doesn't come very often so a

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,010
lot of us also think about it in terms

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,260
of developing the project and who's me

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,710
who's merging your PRS well a community

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,320
includes not just developers but

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,140
everybody else around the project and

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,789
especially users this is a part that we

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,630
often don't think about when we think

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:59,960
about the community within a project but

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,270
again this is a new endeavor for

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,280
societies we're all working together

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,050
without knowing each other which is

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,640
something that doesn't happen anywhere

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,479
else any company you work at any

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,370
business you have any social group you

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,140
end up meeting people and this is a

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,330
different kind of community one that is

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,470
people you don't know and we need to

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:25,300
communicate differently so a key early

00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:28,190
message was from an early Apache way

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,419
patchy way presentation was no jerks

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,140
allowed we can say that we can say avoid

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,039
poisonous people

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,600
don't let the blank ruin your project

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,440
there are several popular

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:46,770
um presentations about this we value the

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,660
group as a whole and we're looking to

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,780
draw in new contributors because that's

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,970
our lifeblood so we need to be they need

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,130
to be comfortable coming to us we don't

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,470
need the 10 times coder we don't need

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,830
the lone jerk who says they can do it

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,100
all

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:05,340
that's not a good Apache project in

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,350
particular benevolent dictators for life

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,010
BD FL which I spelled correctly this

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,920
time BD FL yes are not allowed in Apache

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:16,110
PMC's we will not accept a project that

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,750
has that as their governance model and

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,040
we will not allow a single individual to

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,590
be the leader

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:28,950
we have terminology for we have the PMC

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:30,750
it's a group there's a lot to cover in

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,760
this but really the the immortal words

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,680
of Bill and Ted from their excellent

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,430
adventure movie and the us what many

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,320
years back be excellent to each other

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,480
this is important for any kind of

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,770
community but it's essentially important

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,680
for patchy and we do have a code of

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,930
conduct the foundation has established

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,250
one to ensure you know that we're

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,230
behaving decently to each other that

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,910
we're focusing on the project and not

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,990
bringing the rest of the world to our

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,670
project and the foundation has set that

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,830
up and that is required of all of our

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,230
projects some projects go further they

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,540
make sort of more expectations known but

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,880
the board if necessary which has never

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,860
really happened would make sure that our

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,170
projects are being decent to each other

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,120
and of course when everyone is a

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,800
volunteer if you're more polite and

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,230
clear then other people are more likely

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:25,440
to listen to you and help so wearing

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,940
your hats is kind of a it's not always a

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,410
good term it's one that we use a lot

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,440
that some people people may not

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,730
understand wearing your hat is which who

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,890
you're representing when you're speaking

00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,900
so right now I'm I'm actually

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,840
representing myself because I wrote the

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,450
slides myself but I'm not I'm not

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,680
working for my employer or I'm working

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:49,320
for as a volunteer contributing this is

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,480
important because we expect committers

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,790
on projects to work on behalf of the

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,160
interests with the project as a whole so

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,570
we expect them as much as they can to

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,029
work for the project and not necessarily

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,440
their corporate employer because a lot

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,699
of a lot of our committers work for big

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,139
software houses so it may be a polite

00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,959
fiction to say sort of take your hat off

00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:13,329
and and that's not always it's not a

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,370
great legal theory at all but we expect

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,370
that everyone in the project will

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,699
evaluate everybody else in this in the

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,800
project on their individual merits on

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:27,100
what they've done not their employer not

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,690
their company so there couple important

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,579
side effects one is for a corporate team

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,750
if you have a team that you want to

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,389
start working on a patchy airflow

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,070
altogether that's great from your

00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:39,070
perspective from our perspective we see

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,079
five different developers testers

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,790
documentation people they're all

00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,079
individuals they're not part of your

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,089
corporate team you just need to be aware

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,220
of that because that's important the

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:50,170
side effect for you as an individual is

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,079
that if the merit you build up in a

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,970
project in Apache stays with you when

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,829
you change jobs you can stay a committer

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,810
on that project and that in fact many

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:02,649
people do that many people make that a

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,959
career so that's a key part of we're all

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,250
here as individuals from the Apache

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,329
perspective and this is sort of a

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,959
another riff on the same same thing

00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:17,290
check your affiliations at the door so

00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,190
both we often come from a corporate

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,620
world where there's an implicit

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,230
hierarchy you work for a boss who has a

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,569
managing director who tells you a

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,930
direction that's not how Apache project

00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:31,829
fork the PMC as a whole makes decisions

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:35,220
and you need to understand that that

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:37,800
everybody has a say and a voice and that

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,720
part of the reason for that is because

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,230
then new people feel they might have a

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,130
say we want projects to be diverse

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,470
because they are healthier long-term and

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,060
quite frankly a lot of times the rest of

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,170
the contributors and some projects that

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,730
you want to convince of your new feature

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,740
they don't care which company you work

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,339
for they want to know does it pass the

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:03,550
tests is it actually faster so this is a

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,110
place that is neutral sort of like the

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,950
Switzerland of software we've been

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,870
called

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:14,019
because we don't do corporate politics

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:16,630
and to make this clear the ASF enforces

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,639
independent governance so in my talk

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,529
yesterday that we often talk about open

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,839
source software which we kind of

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,100
understand it's licensed there there's

00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,680
three levels of open open-source

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,440
software there's open governance which

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,940
is a part of many projects open source

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,980
projects at Linux Foundation and

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,589
software freedom Conservancy and of

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,800
course at Apache where the PMC is in

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,589
charge not a company not an individual

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:45,600
but at the ASF we take this to the next

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:47,889
level of open which is open brands so

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,670
while we expect PMC's to work

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:53,470
independently and not for a corporation

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,740
sometimes problems happen with companies

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,930
when that happens the trademarks

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,529
associated with that project are owned

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,269
by the ASF not by the project itself so

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,800
if there is a company for whatever

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:09,180
reason that tries to abuse one of our

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:13,149
projects we can exert trademark control

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,880
over that project and that's a key way

00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,740
that even if some company decides to try

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,810
to hire most of the PMC members on a

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,850
specific project for some reason which

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:25,420
you know as might have happened in the

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,680
past they can try and get all the

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,760
influence that way if they want but if

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,000
they're not being fair to other

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,380
contributors they're benefitting

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,300
themselves and not benefiting the

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,709
project the board can step in either

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,070
through the trademark or through our

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:40,899
internal structures so the key lesson

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,850
here is Apache projects work

00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:47,560
independently and we have mechanisms to

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:51,160
enforce that I hate that sup it's a bad

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,339
word but that's that's the key about of

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,500
community so we'll go back to our thing

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:03,120
we've covered community where we like to

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:05,380
go next I got to hear what you're saying

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,829
communication okay I like that

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,600
I like that how to write I say writing

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:15,880
because really that's what we do most of

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,519
the time but communication is again you

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,510
can't overemphasize this message don't

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,780
be a jerk

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,270
and avoid the poisonous people so when

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,740
we're all when we're not talking to each

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,630
other when we don't have the social cues

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,680
you know of somebody like me who likes

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,910
to use their hands a lot and I can smile

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,160
there are a lot of nuances there that

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,720
are lost and sometimes honestly because

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,790
people misunderstand and then we have a

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,270
conversation like this and sometimes

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,280
people are very very fervent and loud in

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,200
their belief about something and then

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,380
they're like this and it doesn't matter

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,400
sometimes it's what you're doing so this

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,900
these slides of course will be posted

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,070
afterwards this is an excellent it's

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,320
it's fairly old but it's an excellent

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,300
video about how to avoid poisonous

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,730
people ways to deal with people who are

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:06,690
in your community but are not being

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:10,180
productive for the group and of course

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:14,260
don't be a jerk because not only do our

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,220
projects want to be productive but they

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,690
will do something about it

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,340
I certainly hope and if they don't then

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,300
the board or the rest of the foundation

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,180
will do something about it we have a

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,410
code of conduct which is listed here

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,570
it's a pretty simple one we've

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:30,600
essentially adopted it from a common one

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:32,500
but you know ad hominem and

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,940
inappropriate remarks and things that

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,480
don't belong in the project list don't

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,910
belong there and I guess the one quest

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,540
thing here would be if you're in a pmc

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,760
that's had issues with individuals or

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,890
patterns that are you keep thinking

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,440
there's a really inappropriate then

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,570
bring them up the best way to do it is

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,550
to bring them up on list politely and

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,920
neutrally and just say hey this doesn't

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,890
seem right to get the conversation

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,400
started with the community sometimes you

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,500
have a really bad situation or you have

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,510
a pattern where each time you've done

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,080
that you've started a new flame war

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:13,510
because whatever in that case the the

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,050
code of conduct has ways specific ways

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,850
to report specific issues now not it's

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,440
harder to report a pattern but if you

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,540
need help then look at the code of

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,880
conduct page and there are individuals

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,590
you can contact privately to say hey

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,330
we'd like to make a complaint please

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,230
help us resolve this within our

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:37,080
community so that's out there too

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:40,650
and you know none of that would be

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:44,040
necessary if we were all kind to each

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:46,620
other and at a place like Apache con

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,170
where everyone is I mean if a chicken is

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,060
ready I'll of coming Apache con not just

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,170
for the friends I meet but everyone is

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,030
kind to each other we help each other

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,990
out it's like hey you know I'm kind of

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,430
wondering how to get involved in this

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,690
project well I could help you with this

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,500
and by the way here's the person who's

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,630
on the PMC and but on mailing list that

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,970
doesn't always happen and sometimes it's

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,860
for honest reasons with you know you

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,080
don't get the social tone and sometimes

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,750
it's because some people are a little

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,300
bit overbearing we can't have I guess a

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,490
key point is a rider we're all here as

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,210
volunteers so if you're trying to get

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,190
something done in your project then it

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,290
behooves you it makes a lot of sense

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,120
if you make sure that you are kind and

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,380
open and welcoming when you're saying

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,930
hey I want to do this can somebody

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,630
please test it for me because nobody's

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,920
gonna want to test it you say yo hey go

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,590
get the test done you said you'd do it

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,930
why not

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,190
nobody respond to that being kind is a

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,800
way to get the rest of the community to

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,940
help you so that's a should be a

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,340
self-evident point but it isn't always

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,690
we often do how serious disagreements

00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,780
but we need to make sure we have we

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,030
communicate those disagreements in a

00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:05,459
focused and polite and respectful way

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:08,850
for everyone in the project and here's a

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:11,070
slide I hate I never like going over the

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,790
slide because it's sort of a limitation

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:17,900
to our current model but for

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:21,540
communication language so effectively

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:24,360
the core development activity in any

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:27,870
Apache project currently needs to be in

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,100
English and I know this is this is

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:33,300
disappointing especially with great

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,360
strides in especially China where we

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,950
have a lot of new incubator projects

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,660
where they have both of course a

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,990
different language and some different

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,850
communication styles we want to support

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,450
those as much as we can but

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,669
part of how the ASF works is that we are

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,000
an independent home for projects who

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:57,150
want to work our way and so we have some

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,039
restrictions this is one currently but

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,590
we can help them out a lot because we

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,419
provide the backing we provide community

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,030
mentoring we provide trademark support

00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:08,910
the way we provide all that support for

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,669
projects is because we have oversight we

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,559
have a PMC that is listed and is elected

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:16,110
by merit who is in charge of our project

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,970
they every PMC reports to the board of

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,460
directors quarterly some report monthly

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,620
and the board reads every one of those

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,270
in fact that the next talk will be about

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,470
how the board reads every one of those

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:31,980
project reports every Apache member has

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,870
the right to at least read all the first

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,059
public and private communications on

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,370
projects because members can help point

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,470
out issues with our projects so we

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,480
ensure that we really are watching over

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,780
the projects the only way we can do that

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,870
is if the board at least the majority of

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,940
the board can understand your thread

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:54,179
because if there's a problem in a

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,650
project some two or three directors will

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,990
go over that project will review the

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,450
past three months worth of emails on all

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,950
the lists and say you know so-and-so

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,260
said there's a problem okay well I can

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,200
see that and right we need to be able to

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,880
understand that and more than that

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,710
really that the more important point is

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,330
the community needs to be able to

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,270
communicate all right if you have

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,860
different parts some part speaking only

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,380
in French and some part speaking only in

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,090
English they're gonna end up diverging

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,000
in terms of how they manage themselves

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,330
and what code they add and we don't have

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,850
a model yet that can that can merge that

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,370
so unfortunately the key lesson is

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,230
development primarily habits in English

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,400
you need a support channel in a native

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,830
language we have a number of projects

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,600
who do that that's fine but development

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,010
reporting working with the rest of the

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,590
organization currently it needs being

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:48,059
English so we will fly off to take a

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,580
different way so we've covered number

00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,650
one and number five so to speak and we

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,730
have three more choices to go and I'll

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,730
take a break while you think

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:05,940
Marit okay I think that merits a click

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:07,710
click I always find a this is fun

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,260
because a pineapple is an old symbol of

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,920
hospitality where I grew up so I was

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,770
like that one

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:18,870
so merit and I call this merit and not

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:21,360
meritocracy because meritocracy has a

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,670
lot of loaded connotations which I don't

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,870
think translate outside Apache so really

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:30,120
your merit and to define it because it

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:33,900
it often means different things is in

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,140
our context your merit is the value that

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,020
you you as an individual bring to a

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,340
specific project right the code you you

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,770
donate the improvements to the

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,180
documentation you make the fact that you

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,640
get the tests run all the time and then

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,330
helps every else whatever that actual

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,120
action is not just talking about it and

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,630
it that merit really comes from how the

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,790
project judges how valuable it is within

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,460
the context of that project community so

00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,890
you may say I've run 10,000 tests well

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,660
if you've just run 10,000 UI tests but

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,850
haven't run any of the unit tests the

00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,420
project needs for their next thing well

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,560
it's nice but it's not as important to

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:18,360
the project so it's it's really not just

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,180
it's certainly not your abilities it's

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,700
your actual actions within a project

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,640
that the project wants that they need

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,960
that they value as a whole

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,280
that's what merit is about is talking

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,870
about in terms of the Apache Way context

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,260
meritocracy is we sometimes say but that

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,630
has an in it's not the same meaning for

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,570
an Apache project as it often is

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,950
understood elsewhere so we're trying to

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:47,060
find any way to describe that your merit

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,060
is something that stays with you

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,330
so a key point here is the more things

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,160
you do that are valued by a specific

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,740
project because of course each project

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,240
has their own set of creators and their

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:06,450
own PMC the more you do the more you can

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,350
be recognized and you may be granted to

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,600
take more actions

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,740
so the

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,259
steps sort of ladder and way is a user

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,820
of our software who can report bugs or

00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:21,559
patches a contributor is somebody who

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,080
submits patches scuse me and gets them

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,809
accepted who is actually put you know

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,679
work code documentation into the product

00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:32,570
or into our test suite whatever when you

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,090
do that long enough you'll be voted in

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,950
as a committer so the bold ones here are

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:40,009
sort of bigger steps when you're a

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:43,279
committer you now have right access to

00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:45,110
that projects repository so you can

00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,600
directly do work and in some projects

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,669
that commit and then review you can

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,970
simply check your work in and work with

00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:55,340
every else in the project the next step

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,799
is I don't know sort of the the biggest

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,360
one is if you've been a committer for a

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,399
while or some projects only have a

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,860
single list of commuters and PMC members

00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:05,840
they vote you in as both PMC members are

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:09,139
a little bit different that they vote on

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,649
releases and that they vote on new

00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:14,570
committers and PMC members so they also

00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:17,539
they often tend to set the direction of

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,980
the project but really a healthy project

00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:20,809
everybody can help with that

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,240
but the PMC decides when to make

00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,049
releases so that really sort of gives

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,720
them the the directions setting and a

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:31,639
key that may seem a little esoteric a

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,899
key reason for that is part of our legal

00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:37,639
shield so PMC's project management

00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,789
committees are in the bylaws of our

00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:42,679
foundation so when you make a release we

00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:45,169
have to have three PMC members plus one

00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,929
it we have a process how that happens if

00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:50,450
for some reason we're ever sued over a

00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:52,220
release you you won't be sued

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,789
individually somebody can come sue

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,129
Apache

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,379
because that is an act of the foundation

00:23:55,129 --> 00:24:01,100
we as an organization this is how we

00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:02,509
produce software as an organization so

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,450
that's a key part of the legal shield

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,970
and as you do more in a project you may

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,919
be elected as a PMC chair or a vice

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,049
president of that project which really

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,110
doesn't have any other particular powers

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,210
they essentially are the coordinator

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,460
between the PMC and the board they write

00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,419
the month the quarterly board report and

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:25,709
bring any questions back

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:28,320
a separate sort of area of merit is an

00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:29,309
Apache Software Foundation member now

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,739
these are people who have been elected

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:34,559
who typically who've worked on many

00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:36,499
projects have really shown the Apache

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,059
way come spoken at conferences and so on

00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:40,709
who get recognized by an existing member

00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,989
and then are elected

00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:44,219
there's nobody appointed and there are

00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:46,889
never corporations these are always

00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:51,779
individuals that we know you often

00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:54,989
personally members can elect the board

00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:58,200
and can as I said earlier at least

00:24:54,989 --> 00:25:00,950
provide some oversight over all of our

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,389
projects and in particular our members

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,769
also they've worked in many projects

00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:07,049
they have a sort of broader experience

00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,789
they often are also the volunteers who

00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,219
help with the board who help as the

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,409
president and our fundraising team and

00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:16,019
our press team and write there are a lot

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,459
of things that a lot of services Apache

00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,789
provides as a corporation to our

00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:23,759
projects that members help either run or

00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:26,759
at least lead where we outsource and

00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,289
hire an organization to do them and of

00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,719
course the sort of pinnacle of merit

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:33,719
would be director so again these are

00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:35,909
directors are nine individuals who are

00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:38,429
elected by the active membership at

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:41,789
large so somebody earlier this week

00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:44,070
asked me you know how if somehow some

00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:46,559
big company corrupted the board at

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,899
Apache or bought some seats then and

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,929
they were kept going and like they can't

00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:54,869
that that's impossible the ASF is

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:58,049
designed to be the individual of the

00:25:54,869 --> 00:26:00,179
membership elected board there's no way

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,099
if some company came along and started

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:06,479
doing that we would see it we would flat

00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:07,469
out reject them and it was just a it was

00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,729
an interesting question because I could

00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:12,079
not possibly imagine that happening

00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:14,190
Apache is designed to be independent so

00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,789
merit about when you're working in a

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,609
project you're always part of a

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:23,279
community where we hope everybody is at

00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:26,070
least accepting everyone's input so one

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,190
way to think of it is leaders not

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:31,109
managers because of course you're not a

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,759
manager of everyone else or anyone else

00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:34,620
unless you're a manager at a company

00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,899
that has employees

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,749
so a key way to think of it is Merritt

00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:42,269
gets you privileges so you can commit

00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:45,749
the code you can vote on new committers

00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:48,230
when your PMC member things that you

00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:50,490
could do within the scope of the project

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,039
but Merritt does not buy you

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,539
authority it doesn't mean you can just

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,120
say what we're gonna do because I've

00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,080
committed the most code to the project

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,710
you still need to get buy-in from

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,299
everyone else of course you know the

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,679
more that you have done that the

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:08,490
community values the more respect you

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,129
get it's than any human interactions

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,230
that that clearly happens so obviously

00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:15,779
the more people respect you then they'll

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,669
probably say okay I don't really know if

00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,769
we need that code or not but I respect

00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,929
your opinion you've done a great job

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:25,379
sure go ahead put it in that's fine so

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:26,789
that certainly is a way to help the rest

00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:30,779
get the rest of the community more

00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:34,649
likely to help you out so a cautionary

00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,029
tale our umbrella projects so we've

00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:39,539
talked a lot about how communities as a

00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:42,929
whole manage a project which has some

00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,940
code with it right in the past one of

00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,249
the first ones was Jakarta which is

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,559
actually Jakarta little trivia fact

00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:52,259
Jakarta is now a project at the Eclipse

00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:54,119
Foundation which they kindly asked us

00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,740
because our Jakarta was gone long ago

00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,669
and we said we haven't done it for a

00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,269
long time sure go ahead

00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:02,490
so branding thing there Dakar was an

00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:04,679
umbrella project with essentially half

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,929
of the Java stack of the different parts

00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,850
of servlet management and configuration

00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:12,679
and so on all these different projects

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:14,879
which had grown organically with Java

00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,429
and that kind of worked and it had a

00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:19,519
good good name but again we have these

00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:22,769
different sets of people within the PMC

00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,659
working on different chunks of code that

00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,309
you know the person working on the

00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,850
servlet container may not understand or

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:32,539
care about the file management so when I

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,190
over here asked can you review my PR

00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,419
you'll say I don't really understand

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,879
that area I'm not comfortable they can't

00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:43,049
but you can't understand the direction

00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:44,669
of the components or understand you know

00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:47,190
is that really valuable code or not for

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,150
this project then it's hard for the PMC

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,190
to

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,510
work together so umbrella projects are

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,460
something we we now have learned to

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:58,080
avoid and usually at this point most of

00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,910
our projects end up we've had a number

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,130
of projects who get so large and then it

00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,360
sort of ad management consoles and you

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,920
know different file system drivers and

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,210
they say okay this really should spin

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,880
off to another project because they kind

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,140
of do their own thing and if the people

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,650
working on that can all work together

00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,970
they can all see each other's merit and

00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,620
then of course recognize newcomers

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,630
because I wouldn't recognize a newcomer

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,770
from the file system because I don't

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:26,100
work on it so that's just a sort of note

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:28,530
about our organizational structure so we

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,020
will take a different way and we have

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,330
two topics left and I'm really curious

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:39,330
to see which one is gonna get called out

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:41,280
next open development okay well I'm a

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,460
funny story for later so open

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,570
development wide open on the beach we

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,950
could all imagine for those of us who

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:51,920
like warm weather being there open

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,090
development is something that Apache is

00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,220
pioneered along with a few other early

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,950
organizations but we have a specific

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,260
ways we do it we're a dispersed

00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,270
community as we most of us know because

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:07,860
we've traveled to get here or to Vegas

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:09,870
earlier this year and we're also here as

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,460
volunteers often most of us are here a

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,880
part time sort of if we're thinking

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:19,020
about a job so we use mailing lists we

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,630
use asynchronous communication this is

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,550
critical because we're dispersed not

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,310
only in space and time zones

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:29,190
we're disbursed in motivation and our

00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,500
attention spans and we only know for

00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,240
through we only interact through the

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,630
project we don't have the other water

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,000
cooler discussions so having things on

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:43,260
the list and having things spread over

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,240
time the one of the best ways to do

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,090
things is to sort of signal what you're

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,070
going to work on let people read that

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:53,640
work on the code check some of it in

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,230
give people time to digest what's been

00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,360
sent out so that they can add their

00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,810
feedback because often it will be a

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,100
simple plus one might be a bug report or

00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,390
might be a hey we

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,809
already done something like that let's

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,400
collaborate and make something better

00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:10,320
but it's critical that we use mailing

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,020
lists because one of our roles of course

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,559
is if it didn't happen on list

00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:20,039
it didn't happen of course things happen

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,330
in person in real life but when you have

00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,919
an offline meeting when you have a

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,350
meet-up right and get some great

00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,690
feedback from users or a hackathon where

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,419
you do some work together that's great

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,580
bring a description of what happened

00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,830
back to the mailing list make sure that

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,110
before you make decisions you bring the

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,610
information back to the list so all the

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,429
rest of us who aren't weren't there in

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:46,409
person have time to give feedback to

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:50,220
give critique give new ideas we there's

00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:51,720
a every project has user list developer

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,909
list usually a developer list usually a

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,510
user list every project is a private

00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:59,130
list which should be used very rarely

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:03,299
wherever possible use the public list

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:05,490
and it's really only a security bug

00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:08,280
which obviously we need to be private

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,470
with or specific personnel matters maybe

00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,880
maybe like a code of conduct issue that

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,570
we use the private list otherwise they

00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,650
should be very very very quiet and of

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:21,150
course having all these archived

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,730
permanently archived lists with the

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:26,820
discussion as it happened that allows

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:29,100
newcomers to our project to learn not

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,500
just who we are today but how we got

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:35,490
here because they can see our decision

00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,809
process in a thread and just happen all

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,460
the time but there are a lot of times

00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:40,289
will you you'll get the aha moment

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,150
especially when you bring up a new idea

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,620
and we say no that that's not very good

00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:46,049
we've already done that you're like but

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,700
wait I've got X but can point you to a

00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:49,380
mailing list where we say we've gone

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,880
through three of the four things that

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,250
you think are great ideas and for our

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,080
project don't work and you can see oh

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,179
that's why they already thought of this

00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,309
great there it is this ah they haven't

00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:03,090
thought of this yet okay great let's

00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,830
starting thread but again allowing

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,049
newcomers to learn about our project

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,000
whether we're talking to them whether

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:11,190
they're looking our website or they want

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,490
to see our discussions our key key

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,490
points

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:20,750
transparent projects so transfer

00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,940
decisions

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:26,880
we're very distributed where we don't

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,220
know each other's motivations so even

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,050
when we work with the co-worker in a

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,400
software company for example they're

00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,100
different person of course but we're all

00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,330
as shared team or maybe we're in two

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,910
teams that are working together we sort

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:42,180
of know where the company is going for

00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:44,730
us we have no idea why somebody else

00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:47,340
wants a faster file system driver that

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:50,550
sorts it's like sure it already sorts

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,350
okay but there's no understanding of

00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:56,010
that so making sure that when we make

00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:58,500
decisions everyone can say what they're

00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:02,460
trying to do and why they think it's

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,800
important and then of course have some

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,930
time for feedback so I think I said

00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,660
that's early in the earlier slide so the

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,179
best way to work in terms of proposing

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,980
new work is to Telegraph your intent

00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,080
they say hey I'm thinking about working

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,740
on a new file system driver that does

00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,290
this different sorting algorithm okay

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,810
draft the design openly so don't work on

00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,880
it all by yourself until you think it's

00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,380
done

00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,669
start the design open the open even if

00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,780
you're gonna do most of the work Letta

00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,990
they're other people see it that gives

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,010
them time to think about it to digest

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,470
and of course submit your work as you're

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,130
going don't don't do big code drops that

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:44,610
should be a common lesson by now and of

00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:46,980
course open development Apache a key

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,980
part is a pragmatic license so all

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:53,100
Apache all Apache everything that we

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:57,660
give away is licensed under our Apache 2

00:34:53,100 --> 00:35:02,070
license and the purpose is maximum user

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:04,440
freedom or rather that's how our license

00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,000
is supposed to work is that we give it

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,120
away freely don't sue us we have a

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,210
warranty clause of course but we want

00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,640
you to do whatever you want with it the

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,280
real purpose is because then anybody can

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,780
use it for whatever purpose whatever

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,910
kind of work they're doing proprietary

00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,430
not proprietary I don't care they are

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,670
more likely to contribute back to us

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:30,769
more people can use our software

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:31,670
then for example GPL in some cases the

00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,960
more people that they can use our

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,130
software the more people who are

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,930
probably going to end up coming back and

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,920
fixing things that they need and they'll

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:41,420
to share with us and another part of

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,700
this that's not always obvious for

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,190
smaller projects a difference between an

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,950
individual project or three people and a

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,690
foundation project that Apache is trust

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,529
in the ASF as a corporation we've been

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,049
here for 20 years

00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:56,740
and one of our stated goals often has

00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:59,299
been to be here for the next 50 years I

00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,430
think about your companies and marketing

00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:05,019
plans when does a company have a 50 year

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:07,730
plan so as long as the ASF is here are

00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:09,200
all the original source code all of the

00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,940
history all of our mailing lists

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,010
everything we've ever released it's a

00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,450
product we will maintain on our servers

00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,559
as long as we exist as an organization

00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:20,180
and that gives you some shortness in the

00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,079
future that you'll be always be able to

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,089
get old copies or see what happened

00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:28,339
that's something that's in fact where we

00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:31,150
have the Apache attic it's when projects

00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,890
get less popular and are being developed

00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,539
then we move them into the Attic because

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,910
we recognize there aren't enough people

00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:40,130
to keep a real project running but we're

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,859
always gonna keep the code around we put

00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,130
it in attic we box it up maybe who wants

00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:45,140
it

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,380
go and take it but we let you know that

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,700
we're not supporting it well this

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,130
actually works out quite well because

00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:56,000
the next section ironically enough it's

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,829
decision-making so one of the early

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,769
times I've given this talk I came up to

00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:02,000
the first slide and said okay where

00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:05,000
should we go and somebody immediately

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,099
said decision-making as the first thing

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,190
to choose which I thought was kind of

00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:12,319
obvious in retrospect so we're here

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:16,339
again on our beautiful beach and getting

00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:17,660
ready to go in for a swim how do we make

00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:20,170
decisions as a group

00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:25,160
well of course consensus is preferred

00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:26,750
there's no perfection in software so in

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,000
a developer would say that you know I'm

00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,440
like if I work around it I would never

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,900
actually finish this offer because I can

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,119
always find something better okay it's

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,609
just getting better so we don't

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,299
necessarily have to have everyone 100%

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:42,270
agreed this is

00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:44,250
we just have to have consensus is it

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:49,829
good enough does it pass the tests does

00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:51,720
it not just lower the product down key

00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,910
reason is one this helps make decisions

00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,890
work faster because it get enough input

00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:58,920
and then we're like okay you know I'm

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,329
not gonna complain and a lot of times we

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,549
all work in a very different world so we

00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,950
have different motivations something

00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:07,950
you're really excited about like who

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:10,619
cares doesn't matter if I don't care

00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,930
about it you care about it you care

00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,940
about it the tests pass you should be

00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,819
able to do it we should help everybody

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,280
add the features they need because that

00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:22,980
will encourage other contributors to say

00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,289
hey I could build my thing inside this

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,440
project

00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:32,780
so sometimes we of course can't get to

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,160
consensus and here are two quotes about

00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,079
voting at Apache so we have a very

00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,180
specific way to vote with plus ones and

00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,720
minus ones that I hope many people have

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:45,630
heard about one of these is a good and

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,140
expected required use of voting and the

00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:51,359
other one is something that is necessary

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,049
so a voting is a way to record an

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:58,829
official consensus that's required for

00:38:55,049 --> 00:39:00,480
making software product releases that

00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:04,799
may be one of the very few places it's

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,079
required because that we can show

00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:08,579
legally we've have a as an organization

00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,529
we made the release not you as the

00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:14,490
release manager and that helps with the

00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:16,980
LegalShield I some projects even don't

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,660
have votes on committers new computers

00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,460
even they simply have a sort of lazy

00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,619
consensus somebody says hey I think this

00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,869
person's great here's why anybody object

00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:27,270
don't be objects they let them in that's

00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:31,950
okay but making releases you must do

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:34,529
that the other thing that is necessary

00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:37,010
is voting as a shortcut to move

00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:39,289
consensus forward in a timely manner

00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,279
sometimes we have a project where

00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:43,770
there's a major new module or some

00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:45,089
change where we spent a while trying to

00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,920
make sure we're all really comfortable

00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:50,369
we're all happy with this that's not

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,069
working and it's unfair of some people

00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:55,190
who maybe don't have enough time

00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:56,869
to review or maybe who don't really care

00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,910
about the details but want to argue

00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,930
about it for whatever reason sometimes

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,180
the project needs to be able to make a

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,390
decision and move forward so that all

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,190
the users can get any release in that

00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,309
case project should feel free to vote

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,559
some projects vote very rarely some

00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,289
projects choose to vote for every major

00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,769
new feature whatever works for them is

00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:22,910
fine that's that's a good thing to have

00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:27,319
both models because one of the things we

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:29,119
we don't have is a maximum time to make

00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,339
a decision projects can take as long as

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,660
they want or they can decide we don't

00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:34,430
have enough consensus then we're not

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,109
going to do it in this space we're just

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,839
going to add our code we're not going to

00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:40,940
enable a feature and that's okay maybe

00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:45,829
those people will go and do their own

00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:49,519
product we do have minimum times to make

00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:51,109
most decisions and it is 72 hours so if

00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,819
you're calling a vote we expect you to

00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:55,039
leave the vote open for at least 72

00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:58,640
hours unless it's a security issue

00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:01,699
that's a zero day but the reason is

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,160
because then the community has time to

00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:06,529
provide their input right we all have

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,719
most of us have jobs we have families we

00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:11,809
have vacations so 72 hours at least

00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,829
allows the sort of typical software

00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:16,369
developer who might have a three-day

00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:18,140
weekend time to see the vote and put

00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:19,910
their input in now of course you can

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,630
choose to go longer and that's sort of a

00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:26,930
project too soon but we we expect

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:32,809
projects to wait a certain degree to let

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:34,999
everyone have input because of course in

00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:37,219
an open source project we don't have any

00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:38,630
deadlines there's no boss or manager or

00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:40,519
the board the board certainly is not

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,729
going to give you a deadline unless it's

00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,349
a security bug perhaps the only

00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:49,099
deadlines we have are the ones that we

00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:50,900
agree on together now a great thing a

00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:53,329
number of projects do is they they write

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,069
project roadmaps together or they plan a

00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:56,809
release cadence because they're there

00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:59,269
users expect to quarterly release or

00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:01,160
whatever and it's great when projects do

00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:03,020
that because it sets the expectation for

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,030
the whole community to

00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,760
both understand that's how it should

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:10,790
work to work towards it and as a way to

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,310
signal to your users who might become

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:17,030
contributors what's expected in the

00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:20,000
project so those are it's great when

00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:21,800
projects do that kind of work but it's

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,060
certainly not required and planning

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:29,900
projects get along without it but the

00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,390
key part here is we're all working here

00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:36,770
as volunteers with our own reasons for

00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:40,150
being here and any way we can make the

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,470
decision process make the communication

00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,720
allow as many people from the community

00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,080
to participate in the work they want to

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,640
that makes for both the more efficient

00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,339
project we get more input we get more

00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,609
ideas but it also shows a welcome miss

00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:58,790
to more to anybody who's watching us on

00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:01,670
our public mailing lists gives them a

00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:03,140
sense hey if I show up and I have a

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,359
great idea but I'm not a committer yet

00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,910
but like hey I have these three patches

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,099
that I think would be great the newcomer

00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,660
can say hey if I bring this over they're

00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:12,650
gonna listen to me you know they might

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,290
not accept it but at least they'll

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,290
listen they'll review it and maybe I can

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:22,180
become a committer and that's the

00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:25,609
long-term point of the Apache Way is

00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,380
making it easy for newcomers to figure

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:29,330
out how to join your project to actually

00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,210
understand how you work and then the de

00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:34,310
feel like they might be valued as a

00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,910
contributor if they come join your

00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:40,820
community so this is perfect timing

00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:44,150
because we will go off to questions to

00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:48,440
answer so of course the Apache way needs

00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:50,000
your input my slides are on my website I

00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,830
have another website that talks about

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,440
this I'm happy to accept pull requests

00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,869
and of course all the documentation at

00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,210
the ASF is of course open source so

00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:01,520
committers are welcome to come over to

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,500
the community development project and

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,230
help out right if there are better ways

00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,359
we can explain this if there are great

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:10,730
things your project is done they're a

00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:12,619
little bit different then let the board

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:15,050
know let the community development

00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:16,270
project know and they can help review it

00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,920
and maybe

00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,660
push that out to other projects or let

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,960
other projects know about it let's say

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:26,110
it that but that's all I have and I'm

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:37,990
hoping we have some questions especially

00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:39,190
from newcomers questions anyone ok if we

00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,900
have no questions from newcomers I will

00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,390
open up questions to any experienced

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:50,950
Apache members because I know well I

00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:56,160
will get at least one just a curiosity

00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:59,610
about the Attic and if I want to UM

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:04,450
restart a project from the Attic mmm

00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:07,840
should it run through the incubator it

00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,250
depends like any complicated question it

00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,540
depends

00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,750
it doesn't need to run through the in

00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,980
creator if you have if you can show hey

00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,420
I'm a previous committee and I know

00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,480
somebody else's previous committee and

00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,210
this other company wants to work on it

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,250
we're gonna get going right away then

00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,840
you know come talk to the Attic talk to

00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,850
Community Development and say hey we

00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,000
want to restart it and if you if you

00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:33,130
have experienced Apache committers that

00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,470
may be enough to simply bring it back as

00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,630
a top-level project if it's just you

00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,400
then yes going to the incubator and

00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,250
asking hey who else would want to work

00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:46,270
on this I have these ideas because

00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:48,400
really the the input criteria for having

00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:50,950
a new project whether it's through the

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,870
incubator or bringing back an attic is

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:57,250
do we have three trustable PMC members

00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:01,000
three people on the PMC you can serve

00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:02,440
who will watch over the project and one

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,180
because we hope they will be able to

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,530
collaborate in and do work even if

00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,360
they're busy right you have a little bit

00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:11,950
of time three of you together could make

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:15,310
code work but fundamentally if there is

00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,840
a security bug we need three PMC members

00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:19,030
who are watching the list and even if

00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,880
they aren't experts who will say okay

00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:24,220
here's a security bug we will step up in

00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,710
this emergency to fix it and make a new

00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:29,830
release so really is that it's the

00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:32,410
community that we need but

00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,760
yeah and just ask I mean if you ask on

00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,670
that attic list somebody couldn't help

00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,970
point you guide the next steps up in the

00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,660
front

00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:43,810
hi I'm Victor and I am one of the

00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,610
newcomers so I actually have many

00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:47,260
questions but I'll start with one and

00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:52,450
see if I can give other people

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:55,330
opportunities so the first one being do

00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:58,090
you have a limit requirement a number

00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:02,350
lower limit requirement for number of

00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:04,780
PMC serving on a PMC number of PMC

00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:07,840
members on that one PMC like three I can

00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,420
see is and a number yeah 3 3 is the

00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:14,110
minimum okay so if there's only 3 then

00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:18,970
all three have to vote YES on like PMC

00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:21,880
approval required process yes ok it's

00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:25,060
then at least we have 3 humans who can

00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,100
can do something that's the key point I

00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,140
mean there are there there certainly

00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,820
plenty of projects that have large VMC's

00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,380
where most people aren't active we need

00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,060
3 people who are paying attention I'm

00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,980
Justin do you have a did you want to do

00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:40,090
really quick follow up on that or that's

00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:43,119
good Africa that we got mud on the end

00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,950
and we'll come back and I'll be here you

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,560
know for the next couple hours and of

00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:50,590
course I'm online and I will post the

00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:52,869
slides they'll be on the conference

00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,540
website and on my own website

00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:58,440
Shane's slot Shane slides ok we have

00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,440
time for one more question

00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:09,040
have you had conversation around

00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:13,300
standing the ASF to areas like China in

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:17,650
Chinese or South America in Spanish yeah

00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:21,550
yeah that's that's a tricky question

00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:25,420
because Salva is in the depth of

00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:26,830
expertise that we have in in the active

00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,260
members right the members who help the

00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,330
board who step up to be different

00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,119
officers behind the scenes who

00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,800
essentially end up being the mentors who

00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,109
helped all of the pod lengths come

00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,800
through our incubator

00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:43,830
and we don't have enough of that Brett

00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,100
who speaks other languages

00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:48,990
and it's some of that this knowledge

00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,290
about the Apache way and how we expect

00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:56,370
things to happen is hard to disseminate

00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:59,520
to people who are native speakers we

00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:00,900
would love to I don't know how weird and

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,900
get there for a while

00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,240
what what might actually be best is if

00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:09,630
there were a few people from one region

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,580
who worked together who at least one of

00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,590
whom was an Apache member we could work

00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,850
with them to set up their own

00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,170
organization potentially because also

00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,750
some of the things especially in China

00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:21,960
it's not just the language apparently

00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:24,240
the developers love using WeChat so they

00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,120
will have a detailed development

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,740
discussion on WeChat figure out the dual

00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,230
code review figure this out make the

00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,390
decision check it in and that doesn't

00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,980
match with our mailing list expectation

00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:38,220
so there are some cultural things I

00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:41,370
think that the governance needs to start

00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,700
from the culture and then you know

00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,170
follow our practices that makes sense

00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,720
but that is the thing yes we absolutely

00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:51,030
think about that and I wish we could do

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,710
better now but where that would take

00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:57,360
more work but we would love to talk

00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:59,400
about that okay well we should let the

00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,780
next speaker come on up and thank you

00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,190
thank you to the sound people in the

00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:08,090
back and the video people and so on okay

00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,180
[Applause]

00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,530
you

00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,530
