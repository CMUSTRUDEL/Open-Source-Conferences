The number of CERN teams utilising big data frameworks – Apache Hadoop, Spark and Kafka to develop their systems has grown significantly in recent years. These systems include the next generation CERN Accelerator Logging Service (NxCALS) which logs data from 20,000 devices that monitor the CERN accelerator complex for online and offline analysis, the monitoring system for the CERN IT Data Center infrastructure and the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) and recently High Energy Physics core data processing software package ROOT can perform parallel and distributed execution using Apache Spark Engine.

This talk will provide an overview of the current deployments of Apache Hadoop, Spark and Kafka and challenges faced in supporting demanding needs from various CERN communities.
