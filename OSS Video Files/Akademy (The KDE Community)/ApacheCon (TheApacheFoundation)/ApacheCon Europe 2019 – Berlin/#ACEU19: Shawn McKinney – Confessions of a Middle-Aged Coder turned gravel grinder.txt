Title: #ACEU19: Shawn McKinney – Confessions of a Middle-Aged Coder turned gravel grinder
Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: ApacheCon Europe 2019 – Berlin
Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/confessions-middle-aged-coder-turned-gravel-grinder

This talk discusses the journey of a middle-aged coder who transitioned from one who'd never ridden more than twenty miles into a hard-core endurance cyclist, specializing in tough gravel events like the Dirty Kanza.  

These are single day events between 150 and 210 miles, and are largely unsupported.  They cover challenging gravel and dirt roads in remote regions of the great plains, in places like Kansas and Nebraska.

The narrative includes a bit on the why and how, along with some of the most memorable experiences that have occurred.  

As we discuss the adversities overcome, a few parallels will be drawn to working on tough technology projects, things like keeping your head under pressure and never giving up. 

In any case it will be a departure from the typical ApacheCon session and hopefully supplying entertainment value to weary conference goers whose brains may be fried from multiple days of intense technological focus.

	00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:11,309
and so today we're gonna talk about

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:13,830
gravel grinding and hopefully that'll be

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,450
fun for you guys I know you know we're

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,060
on the last day last afternoon almost

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,100
lunchtime you must be bored or tired or

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,830
worn out so hopefully you'll get a

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,910
little entertainment out of this before

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:33,660
I start I wanted to have a few words

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:37,670
about my dear friend Garrett one who's

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,749
courageous battle with the disease is

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,749
continues to rage so he's a rider

00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:46,859
professional musician husband father and

00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:48,690
I just learned as I traveled here that

00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,079
his treatment has been discontinued and

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,519
he's going to enter a hospice and so

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,469
Garrett you haven't dulled to my silly

00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:58,159
little pastime listen to my stories

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,409
encourage the continued pursuit and

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,639
never to lose my childlike curiosity to

00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,420
try new things you're in my thoughts

00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:11,390
this talks for you

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:13,920
warning middle-aged man and lycra alert

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,619
so we're talking about gravel grinding

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,250
we're not talking about these guys okay

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,549
just testerone charged pterodactyl

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,180
looking dudes riding real fast That's

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,960
not me that's not us where we don't ride

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,030
these bikes with skinny little tyres

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,630
we're not these guys barreling down

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,689
mountains jumping over stumps and rocks

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,930
and going to the emergency room that's

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,450
not us either we're not riding those

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,219
kind of bikes ah this is us gravel

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,649
grinding anybody do that anybody know

00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,539
what this is

00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:53,219
yes sorta a couple people it's actually

00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,189
one of the hottest segments in cycling

00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,350
right now we're talking about roadways

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,850
that aren't unpaved in the United States

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,030
there's quite a lot of these in the

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,799
Midwest especially various granularities

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,780
of rock dirt mud sand really kind of

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,450
designed for farmers and stuff like that

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,019
and cyclists have decided that that we

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,940
like it too so this is our kind of bike

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,650
it's called a gravel bike it looks

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,620
kind of like a road bike it's got the

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,060
same little curly handlebars but it's

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,790
different it's got a different kind of

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,850
geometry it's more relaxed it's got a

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,040
lower bottom bracket a longer wheelbase

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,910
is designed for stability over very

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,880
rough surfaces and comfort usually has

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:43,170
disc brakes tires are wider anywhere

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,760
from say 2030 to 245 millimeters less

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,320
air pressure in the tires a lot of times

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,500
tubeless for safety and comfort on these

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,090
on these surfaces so the great thing

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,120
about gravel you know and I grew up in

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,820
Kansas Kansas is a very large state it's

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,230
about 400 miles wide and on 220 miles

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,970
tall and it's largely unpopulated and so

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,490
it's it's covered with gravel roads

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,230
they're on a grid grid pattern which

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,480
means you go a mile you hit an

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,190
intersection you can go north south east

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,060
west go any direction go another mile

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,590
another intersection forever okay so you

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,270
want to figure out a route on a gravel

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,820
bike you pull out your graph paper and

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,270
you draw it and you go do it okay and

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,670
it's just really cool so we're talking

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,970
about a transition from you know me old

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,040
coder guy to this gravel dude so how did

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,370
that happen so I was born in the 60s

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,760
grew up in the 70s small-town America

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,100
and so you know this was a town we lived

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,130
in and those were the hills this is the

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,130
town and mom said don't cross the

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,650
highway you know to us and we did it

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,650
anyway and we'd go out and we'd ride

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,000
those hills joyfully and gleefully and

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,470
then we'd washed up real carefully

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,360
before we went home so we wouldn't get

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,790
caught by mom and then she always found

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,440
out and we're like you know and when I

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:10,080
had you find out and she told us later

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:12,209
it was mud in our underwear so like most

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,560
coders I think we go through this period

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,489
where we forget our initial loves and we

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,490
you know and by the way that's my father

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,990
and he was the guy who inspired us with

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,880
bikes there was always plenty of bikes

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,260
around it was a high priority if you had

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,630
a breakdown on a bike that was a high

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,770
priority maintenance item it was a

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,210
ticket that usually

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,160
resolved within 24 hours so you know

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,870
like most coders we go through this

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,720
period where we we kind of grow up and

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,520
we worry about school and finishing our

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,669
education and we start our career as we

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,300
get married we have kids and we don't

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,979
ride we work and something you have kids

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,199
and you kind of ride right you know and

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,150
I think every kid needs a bike I'm a

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,940
strong believer of that now there's my

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,099
son Zachary when he was about three and

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,960
you know I'd ride a couple miles here in

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:12,900
a couple miles there and then you know

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,289
if you start a company those are my

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,900
brothers and I and Vegas and you start

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:24,900
working 40 hours 50 hours 60 hours 70

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:26,419
hours 80 hours a week 10 12 14 16 18 20

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,460
hours a day

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:33,240
work and drink and eating not taking

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,669
care of yourself you know and you know

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,759
in my case I had sort of a health crisis

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:43,139
in the 2000s had an intestinal bleeding

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,580
my spent a week in the hospital and I

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,440
said well I got to take my foot off the

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,000
gas because this might be a short road

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,250
for me and so my mom my wife for our

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,909
anniversary in 2013 bought me my first

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,710
road bike and I wrote it's like a little

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,630
kid again we're all smiling you know

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,210
it's like hey this is fun yeah it's just

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,949
as much fun now as it was then and then

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,469
we write with her friends and its social

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,990
and we're all smiling and then it was

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:11,250
like okay well let's do some races and I

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,680
started entering some vents and road

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,870
events and this was my first road event

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,130
right there 2014 it was a hundred mile

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,580
road event in Little Rock Arkansas

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,860
called the big Dam bridge and I realized

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,650
I had sort of an affinity for endurance

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,389
and I enjoyed it and I didn't really

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,440
know much about gravel until my little

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,349
brother Timothy pictured here in 2014

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,150
said hey would you support me on my tri

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,680
for completing the dirty Kansa what's

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,029
that well we'll talk about that here in

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,520
a minute so I said yeah I'll do it and

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,800
got inspired and I said I want to do

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,870
at some time start writing this growling

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,509
it's like now I'm still too busy you

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,190
know conferences and stuff so maybe

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,449
someday but I don't have time for it now

00:06:53,190 --> 00:07:00,810
and then a 2015 things changed and we

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:05,280
lost my father to a disease that I don't

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,970
want to name and let's just say I had a

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,060
change of heart

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,740
and a change of focus and I realized

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,430
that life's not all about how many lines

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,620
of code you can write or how cool your

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,509
your component is you know there's

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,569
there's other things to focus on and so

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:24,990
in 2016 I signed up for the dirty Kansa

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,940
that the 200 mile event dirty Kansa is

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,539
you know again it's a gravel event and

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,849
so they say it's a and I get this shirt

00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:36,930
you know find your limit so they have

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:37,919
different distances you know 25 50

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,409
hundred 200

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,389
and last year they added a 350 mile

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,629
event well the 200 mile events sort of

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,169
the the Super Bowl of gravel and there's

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,639
I think last year 2200 participants and

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,880
they capped that out you got a win a

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,400
lottery to get in it and so there's the

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,259
peloton of last year that's around mile

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,889
20 they kind of break up later

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:05,759
those dudes up front I mean they're pros

00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:08,669
right and so they finish in you know

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,319
like to say 10 hours 11 hours the the

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,169
winner this year

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,099
Colin Strickland finished in under 10

00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:16,289
hours set a record

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,860
you know that's 10 hours over 200 miles

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,440
of you know 12,000 feet climbing on

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,930
gravel so I mean it's just an amazing

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,090
endurance feat of endurance you know he

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,250
broke away at Mile 100 and rode the last

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,990
hundred miles by himself so he didn't

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,339
even have a you know he wasn't even in a

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,289
pace line just an amazing thing so and

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,000
so one of the beautiful things about the

00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,829
dirty Cannes is where it's held is held

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,659
in the Flint Hills of Kansas and you say

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:44,240
well Kansas is flat we'll go ride a bike

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,240
in the Flint Hills and tell me that

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,060
but the Flint Hills is it's one of the

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,149
last tall grass prairies on the planet

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,160
and it's unbroken because of its rocky

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,880
and so it's not good for farming so it's

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,130
mostly ranching

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,600
and so it's real remote and you're

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,819
riding out there for miles you don't see

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,980
a house there's no fences it's just cows

00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,540
cows wandering around and it's just

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,050
beautiful you're like in a sea of grass

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,940
it's just it's just a beautiful

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:17,139
panoramic you know it's it's it's

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,420
captivating and it's also it's it's real

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,370
rocky and the type of rock a lot of its

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,660
chert rock which is a flint it's kind of

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,850
and that's what the Indians used to make

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,699
arrowheads out of so you can imagine

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,620
when it does to your tires what it would

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:33,220
do to you if you fell on it so it's it's

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,709
an amazingly incredibly cool event and

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,720
gravel is the I think I said earlier is

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,600
the largest fastest growing segment and

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,889
cycling today especially in the states I

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,319
think the roadways aren't really safe

00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:47,680
for us anymore gravels a way that you

00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:49,630
can get out sort of enjoy remote regions

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,980
and and it's just the right speed you're

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,470
in a car you're going too fast you're

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,050
gravel you you absorb it you you feel it

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,730
you taste it you smell it and it's just

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,410
it's just an amazing thing well they're

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,769
also unsupported so you're out there

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:06,279
kind of on your own and so that kind of

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:08,170
adds an element so the dirty Kansas kind

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,880
of cool they'll tell you right off the

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,850
bat you know if you break down or

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,040
whatever we will not rescue you so you

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,839
know and you do have you have to have a

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,490
support team where they meet you to

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,620
checkpoints and so they'll come get you

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,079
your sport team will but nobody else

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,790
will and then they also allow when

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,680
you're out on the course participants

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,259
can help each other so that kind of has

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,509
this kind of cool indie vibe to it where

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:34,240
people are real you know helpful to each

00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:35,680
other and then you have to maintain an

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,810
average speed of about 10 miles an hour

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,250
or they'll kick you off the course so if

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,230
you're talking about 200 miles that's

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:45,759
like 21 hours if you have to finish it

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,470
so who does it guys like that Ashton

00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,709
Lambie he won the hundred mile event

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,769
this year he's he's a badass

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:56,560
two-time Pan American cycling champion

00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,810
and world record holder you know he

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,579
passed me up I mean they start the 30

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,439
minutes behind us and he's just passed

00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,630
me up like that but and then there's

00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:06,880
other pros guys from the tour there's no

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:11,019
money involved with it they do it for

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,650
glory and and glory alone who else does

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,660
it guys like

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,850
just everyday people people that have

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,410
stories to tell people that are that are

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,600
just trying to you know trying out new

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,070
things and it's just it's kind of

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,580
inspiring talking to people hearing

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:28,450
their stories and oh the finish line is

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,490
is just an amazingly inspiring place to

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,820
be when these people cross it's just you

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,720
know tears and so you know you talk

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,640
about well you're out there for 200

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,150
miles how do you navigate you know this

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,560
is the course from 2016 through 18 you

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,670
know you see all those little Jags those

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,540
returns well how do you know when to

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:48,940
turn they're not marked there's no signs

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:52,300
so how do you navigate that 200 miles

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,250
and so you know you can use these which

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,320
are cue sheets which will tell you with

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,589
your by computer mile 55 you turn left

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,080
on this road you know mile 110 watch out

00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,460
for the dangerous rocks you know things

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,100
like that which can be incredible

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,589
incredibly tedious you know you're out

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,660
there at night how you gonna read it

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:13,060
most of us use GPS you upload the GPS

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,240
route to your your GPS unit and it'll

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,900
just tell you you know when to turn so

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,990
this is where my parallels with software

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,360
kind of begin and that's where you know

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,209
training and preparing for an event like

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,390
this is kind of like a software project

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,350
you have many phases you have a

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,080
procurement phase you have a

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,959
modification testing deployment planning

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,790
and rollout so procurement is where you

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,220
spend thousands of dollars on machines

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,980
or you could not me I got kids in

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,170
college so I had a $650 mail-order bike

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,640
delivered to me or to my little brother

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,100
and he assembled it and shipped it to me

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,920
and then you do your modifications and I

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,560
spent a couple thousand dollars on mods

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,200
making this baby mine you know you see I

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,660
got Aero bars and saddlebags and frame

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,930
bags and different wheels and you know

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,700
there's a suspension and the stem to

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,860
dampen the vibration because you know

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,240
200 miles on gravel you know the first

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,450
time I did it my hands were numb for

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,100
three days afterwards and just you know

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,120
you name it so I could talk to you all

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,400
day about modifications and then there's

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,930
testing and you you know you have to

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,040
test what's your nutrition see what are

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,400
you gonna eat when you're out there what

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,190
are you gonna drink what kind of luck

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,150
like solid liquid you can eat sweet

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,500
you're gonna eat salty you know how are

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,060
you gonna train is your bike right so

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,350
you got to so you got to get out there

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,420
and ride and so there's different

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,520
strategies for training and we could

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,810
talk about that for an hour and I'm

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,550
certainly no expert but you know

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,930
high-intensity training is real popular

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,180
right now where people have what are

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,440
called power meters where they can you

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,700
know they'll know how much power they're

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,740
laying down or there's heart rate

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,680
monitors and so you'll train you know

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,020
shorter distances but high intensity so

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,580
that's the scientific method I don't do

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,250
that I'm kind of old school I just do

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,650
perceived effort and volume so I try to

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,570
hit 75 percent of the volume for

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,810
whatever the target is so in this case

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,870
it's 200 miles so a month prior I'll try

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,330
to hit say 150 miles on a particular day

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,920
and and during that time you know if

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,060
your bikes not fit right or if there's

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,660
anything wrong you're gonna you're gonna

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,800
realize it deployment planning is

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,200
another thing we could talk all day

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,910
about what do you bring you're out there

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,320
I said before it's not supported you

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,400
have a flat tire nobody's going to come

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,470
out and change it you don't have a

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,450
support team out there that can so you

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,400
got to bring spare tubes you got tools

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,740
you have chain breaks you got to have a

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,210
link if your derailleur snaps off or

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,500
what are you gonna eat while you're out

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,180
there how you gonna carry it are you

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,070
gonna eat sweet or you can eat salty and

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,450
so all that stuff you know it gets in

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,940
your head you start thinking about it

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,160
and you make these checklists and you

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,480
know this checklist is all the things

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,760
that I brought with me at the starting

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,180
line and then these are the things that

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,910
you know that you have your support team

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,100
meet you out on the on the field with at

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,800
the checkpoints and you know things like

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,930
spare tires and water you know you're up

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,880
to 70 miles between checkpoints on a hot

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,320
day so you got to have a cup mate you

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,970
know maybe a gallon a half two gallons

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,490
of water different kinds of electrolytes

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,870
how you gonna carry that that's all part

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,030
of this so it's like an expedition

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,370
almost you know it's and I it's one of

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,870
the things I really enjoy about it and

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,400
then you got the roll out and then you

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,050
you know that's like in software you

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,490
roll out you hope that your preparations

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,320
were right you hope everything went

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,560
right you know you cross your fingers

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,210
and you go and that's the starting line

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,800
of dirty cans I forget what year it is

00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,930
but you can see there's thousands of

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,120
people and the whole town of Emporia

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,290
comes out and poori is a small town say

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,660
10,000 people and

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,889
they're all out there tens of thousands

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,630
of people are out there and it's you

00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:46,579
know you feel like a rock star they're

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,690
doing cowbells and it's just a really

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,220
really cool thing so you know sometimes

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,170
it's good right sometimes you're out

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,839
there you do that race and it's good the

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,269
beer is cold everybody smile and it

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,190
tastes good you know the birds are

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:04,069
chirping the flowers are blooming and

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,740
the course is beautiful

00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:10,009
you know everybody's friends are

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,449
everywhere and you know we're all

00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:13,579
smiling and we're riding we're having

00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:15,259
fun and we see cool things you know and

00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:18,319
it's just great it couldn't be any

00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:20,750
better and then you know it can be

00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,279
unusual and funny like this guy right

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,529
here who made a bike so he could take

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,000
his dog along or you know this guy who

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,620
brought a rubber chicken and had its

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,389
picture taken instead of him you know in

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,000
2017 I think it was we rode with this

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,449
guy Derek who five miles before the

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,100
finish line

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,139
he's like I'll see you guys the finish

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,790
line you know and he kind of pulled off

00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,319
and then we saw him later and he rode

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,899
across the finish line in a thong bikini

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:47,839
so you know I don't know I mean it's

00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,430
just a kind of a crazy thing and then

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,850
you you know the next day you eat a lot

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:57,110
that's myself and my cousin Greg I'm

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,880
2016 I think that was a pancake and so

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,529
you know you have to consume you can

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,380
imagine what your appetite would be on

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,699
the next day and then sometimes bad

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,409
things happen you know it could be good

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,620
and then five minutes later it's bad and

00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:15,290
when it's bad it's really really really

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:17,329
bad and so for example in March of 2018

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,890
I had a freak accident tore my bicep

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:23,120
from my forearm and had to have surgery

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,500
three months before the event the

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,089
doctors like you can't ride for four

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,850
months so I'm like well that means I

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,700
can't ride the Kansas so I'm like well

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,919
can I train indoors he goes yes so I

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,970
bought a smart trainer and I trained

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,500
indoors and so when you're on a smart

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,080
trainer it's not really about miles it

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,909
starts to become time and power and so

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,970
you know back to my volume targets I

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:48,309
tried to hit

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,259
you know twelve hours on the on the

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,700
thing you know a month prior and I

00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:53,559
actually did that on a trainer and I

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,450
still don't know how I did it but twelve

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,429
hours on a trainer is not anything I'd

00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,200
ever want to have to do again and I

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,909
completed the course you can see I have

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,590
an arm brace on there so I ignored the

00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:09,519
doctor's orders I didn't say I was sane

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:11,830
so this year in February we're on a

00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,289
gravel ride in the washdown mountains

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,299
outside of Little Rock there's just a

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,610
little water crossing that I've done a

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,220
bunch of times there's been a bunch of

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,990
rain and so here I am my buddy Dan's

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,039
taking a picture and we're contemplating

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,360
or we gotta cross or we're not gonna

00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,100
cross and I'm looking at it I'm trying

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,240
to pick a line on my I asked him I said

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,179
well what's the worst thing that can

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,220
happen and I went and this is how it was

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,840
supposed to go that was a few weeks

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,399
earlier you know and you know like your

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,629
feet maybe get wet or something and

00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:40,450
everything's fine well this is what

00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:42,460
happened and it swept me off the roadway

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,100
into the end of the pool water and

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,720
actually I heat my buddy Dan he was he

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:56,110
took a video and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:59,970
show it to you now of that and I can't

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:02,889
hardly watch this you can see right here

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:07,809
is where I tore my hamstring when my leg

00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:10,389
came up and I went down into that and so

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,529
I was injured and I was kind of it was

00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:14,529
when I knew immediately that my

00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:17,139
hamstring popped and I was like okay

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,909
this is bad and then my bikes and I

00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,899
learned that bikes float and it started

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,370
floating away and I'm like do I go for

00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,639
the bike and I'm like no I don't think

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,110
so

00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:28,509
and then right then I got pulled down

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:29,320
and I it it took way too long to come

00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,850
back up again

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,679
and so it's one of those things where it

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,039
was bad worse and then it was like holy

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,230
 this is you know your whole life

00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,779
flashed before your eyes and then I you

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,090
know obviously I survived my bike

00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,409
floated downstream we had to have

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,700
somebody come pick us up because there

00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:48,940
was no way we were gonna ride out of

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,389
that sometimes sometimes it gets ugly

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,129
this is the 2015 Kansas you get on these

00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:55,869
B roads that don't have Rock and it's

00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,879
just it's just dirt and when it rains

00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:59,110
it's it's this kind of clay that's like

00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,190
peanut butter

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,330
and so you got to carry your bike

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,160
because if you if you ride your bike

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,420
you're you'll break a chain you'll tear

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,670
your derailleur and your day will be

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,200
over so you imagine carrying your bike

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:12,580
for three miles and then having to ride

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,340
195 or 200 miles after that it can be a

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,880
little demoralizing sometimes things

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,370
don't go according to plan you know it's

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,679
a long day Kansas is hot the events in

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,440
June it's you know humidity is real high

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,390
you run out of water I ran out of water

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,610
one year sometimes your electrolyte mix

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,320
doesn't work you start cramping you run

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,260
out of food or you got food and you

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,460
can't eat or you know you have a

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:42,610
breakdown and or you you have a wreck or

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:45,190
you know and you just you just tell

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,290
yourself it's okay just just just keep

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,179
going you know and it's kind of like

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,220
when things go bad you go just just

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,690
don't think about the bad you just you

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,400
just think about what you got to do just

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,230
keep your pace focus on your breathing

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,419
it's like when you're coding you just

00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,710
you just gotta if you think about all

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:02,470
the bad stuff and all the bad things

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,960
that are happening you'll go crazy you

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,610
hit walls you know I've written stories

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,950
about the walls I almost always have hit

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,450
a wall on the cans on one leg or another

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:15,010
the gravel world's there's another tough

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:17,110
one this year at the finish line I just

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,910
basically took my bike to my truck threw

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,270
up and went home that was my finish line

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:24,460
experience it's but it's okay you just

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,429
keep going you know and you think well I

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,690
just got to make that next checkpoint

00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,940
maybe there'll be a slice of pizza and I

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,540
can have a coke and I can or maybe you

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,280
know I can put on my favorite socks and

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:39,840
and just sit down for a while and just

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:43,630
keep going and usually when it gets dark

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:48,460
it cools off and things get a little

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,780
easier and you can kind of recover and

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,549
then you just find a way to get across

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,110
that finish line and for most of us we

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,110
don't care what the time is we just want

00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,870
to get across this was my first one here

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:02,380
and you can't see that but that says 20

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:04,419
hours and 48 minutes so that was 12

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,790
minutes before the cutoff so we just

00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:09,970
barely made it but that was good enough

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:12,429
you know we got across and that's all we

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,910
cared about and then you enjoy it for a

00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,590
little bit

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,240
you know with your friends and you maybe

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,750
have a beer if you don't throw up and

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:23,290
then you next day you pack it all up and

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,210
you go home and then it gets in your

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,830
head you know and you think about it you

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,360
know the mistakes you made and you go

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,980
well if I just would have done this if I

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,450
just had this on my bike if I just

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,100
carried a little bit more water if I

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,680
just drink a little more electrolytes if

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,480
I just picked a better line then it

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,550
would have went better and so it's kind

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,610
of like a software yeah you you obsess

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,990
over it and and then it brings you back

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,660
next year and people are you gonna do

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,640
that again you know and you're like yeah

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,860
you know cuz you just want to keep doing

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,710
it because it's something that gets in

00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,290
your blood there's a lot of good cool

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:59,740
events out there this year I did for the

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,840
first time coast to coast which is it

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,100
goes across the state of Michigan

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,780
literally start at Lake Huron and you

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,120
finish at Lake Michigan it's 210 miles

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,880
it's just beautiful country you go

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,670
through the forest Lance you you travel

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,110
through sand and I learned this year you

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,640
know you're in sand that deep ride

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,260
learning this year that sand is my

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,850
friend every time I hit that I'm sliding

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,080
I just tell myself because you're

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,910
getting anxious and you just stay

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,420
positive sand is my friend sand is my

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,650
friend and you just keep going

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,540
gravel worlds is another one's just a

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,280
sufferfest in Lincoln Nebraska say you

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,530
never ask is flat right we'll try to

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,630
ride a bike not on those gravel roads

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,600
and tell me it's flat and it's hundred

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:41,170
50 miles and it's it's a just an

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,280
incredible event there's a lots of them

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,590
out there I said it's one of the hottest

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,800
segments in cycling right now certainly

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:50,860
in the states dirty river and UK that's

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,840
on my bucket list the rift is in Iceland

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,880
this was the first year for that and

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,190
that's just a you can imagine riding a

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,560
bike on the gravel roads in Iceland what

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,450
kind of experience that would be you

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,880
know there in Iowa there in Missouri

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,010
Oklahoma already mentioned Kansas

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,380
Colorado has one Idaho has a really big

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,960
event there on the East Coast or on the

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,020
west coast they're just popping up all

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,530
over the place so some lessons that I

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,120
learned choose your line carefully

00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,870
things can go from good to bad really

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,390
quickly

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,370
my first

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,860
the first time I did gravel worlds in

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,510
Nebraska I went down twice in about five

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,600
miles because I just wasn't picking a

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,660
good line and hit some sand and you know

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,340
fortunately I was able to continue

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:40,420
random facts salad does not travel well

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,370
don't try to bring it on a ride bikes do

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,050
float I didn't I never would have

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,270
thought of bike floats but it does float

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,430
I know that I've seen it

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:52,240
things don't always go according to plan

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:55,150
don't worry about it just keep going bad

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,950
can be turned into good so I've written

00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,660
about this a bit on my blog I am

00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,890
fortress dotnet I've written about some

00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,820
of these events in detail if you're

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,650
interested have a look and also if

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,330
you're interested in trying it out you

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,850

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:16,780
and I'd be happy to to talk to you about

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:19,530
it so that's my talk I don't I think

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:23,850
we're probably out of time

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,850
