Using Tomcat in a cluster and in a cloud. We start by looking how to configure tomcat to get a cluster and then explore the problems and solutions to have distributed applications running in a cloud. Most cloud providers now have a Kubernetes API. We will look to what we have to add to Tomcat to have a decent cloud support for monitoring, tracing and operating on the cloud.
We will show how to use all the pieces. A demo of a cluster will be prepared and run during the presentation and the corresponding application will be moved to a Kubernetes cloud.
