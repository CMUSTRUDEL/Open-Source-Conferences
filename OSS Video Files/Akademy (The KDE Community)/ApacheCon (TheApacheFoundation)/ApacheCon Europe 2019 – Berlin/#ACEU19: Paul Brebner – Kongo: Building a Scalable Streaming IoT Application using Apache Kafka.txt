Join with me in a journey of exploration upriver with "Kongo", a scalable streaming IoT logistics demonstration application using Apache Kafka, the popular open source distributed streaming platform. Along the way you'll discover: an example logistics IoT problem domain (involving the rapid movement of thousands of goods by trucks between warehouses, with real-time checking of complex business and safety rules from sensor data); an overview of the Apache Kafka architecture and components; lessons learned from making critical Kaka application design decisions; an example of Kafka Streams for checking truck load limits; and finish the journey by overcoming final performance challenges and shooting the rapids to scale Kongo on a production Kafka cluster.
