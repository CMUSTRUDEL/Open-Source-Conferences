	00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,430
I wanted to talk to you today about my

00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,790
first six months on the board and I want

00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,200
you to know that I submitted this talk

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,970
at the very beginning of my board term

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,320
before I had note before I knew what

00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,180
this talk was gonna be about because I

00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,939
didn't have six months of a board to him

00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:27,790
at that point I'm not sure that was a

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:35,530
good idea we'll see I'm gonna take you

00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:38,710
back aways first oops in 1996 I was 19

00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,700
this is long before I knew what others I

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,590
didn't know what the Apache Software

00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,650
Foundation was I didn't even know yet

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,270
that I was gonna be a programmer I had

00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,500
just finished my first year of college I

00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,660
was looking at a second year of college

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,550
and I needed a car and I had I was at an

00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,110
internship a summer internship at might

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,750
at the company my dad worked for doing

00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,360
assistants administration so I had a

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,040
little bit of money not a lot and I had

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,140
to spend my money on college so I got

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,189
the cheapest car I could find it was a

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,439
Honda Accord was $500 I thought it was

00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:15,369
great it was I thought it was beautiful

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,539
I drove it for two months and then it

00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,909
started producing this high-pitched

00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:20,679
peeing sound and blue smoke started

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:25,689
coming out from under the trunk under

00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:29,259
the hood the timing belt hadn't been

00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:30,249
changed out in 200,000 miles when it

00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:33,399
should have been changed out after

00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:34,539
50,000 miles and the head had gotten out

00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,189
of time with the lower half and the

00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:39,189
boughs were hitting the pistons that was

00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:41,049
the high pinging noise and there was oil

00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:44,939
slipping past the pistons and it was

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,929
burning and that was the blue smoke I

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,609
ran into this problem and I couldn't

00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,859
afford another car and I needed the

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:54,579
money to go to college and my dad said

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:55,990
hey why don't we fix the car why don't

00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,459
we overhaul the engine and he'd said

00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,689
this for two reasons first up because I

00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,740
knew I didn't have any money and he

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,420
didn't want to give me the money

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,009
and second off because he wanted me to

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,389
have an understanding of the internals

00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,219
he wanted me to understand what makes

00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:09,610
the car work so I could take better care

00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:17,710
of it so we went out and bought a

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:20,500
Chilton's and took the car part this was

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,330
an interesting experience we did it we

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,040
did it together this was not me handing

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,840
lemonade to my father and letting him do

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,790
the work there was some things I

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,230
couldn't do there was a 19 year old girl

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,640
I couldn't list certain things and there

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,990
were certain certain places I couldn't

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,790
apply the strength that was necessary

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,390
but there also some things he couldn't

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,010
do my hands are small smaller than his

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,330
and there were little little spaces that

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:46,090
we had to manipulate things and that

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,560
only I could get into we changed out the

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,980
head gasket we changed all of the

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,010
gaskets we changed out the timing belt

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:58,720
we changed out the Rings we changed out

00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:00,250
the bearings the head gasket between the

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,060
third and fourth cylinder had blown and

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,930
so we had to get the head we weld it and

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,060
this is the first so we go to the

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,410
machine shop and we take the head in and

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,060
I had a couple of questions at that

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,410
point because we were gonna get new

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,640
rings for the Pistons and I wanted to

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,170
understand do they need to be oversized

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,130
what do we need to do to make it work I

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,320
was asking the machinist questions he

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,320
was standing here I would ask him a

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,790
question he would turn to my dad for

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,560
every single one and answer the question

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,910
to my dad and that's the first

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,970
experience that I can remember where I'm

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:39,790
fairly certain it was sexism he was not

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:45,190
willing to look at me and give those

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:47,740
answers to me another interesting

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,800
experience I had during that was when I

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,270
went to buy the the Rings I wanted to

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,920
get the cheapest price possible so I was

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,030
calling around to lots of automobile

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,400
shops that was before the internet I

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:03,520
couldn't just surf I called one shop and

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,910
I said I want a set of rings for a Honda

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,840
Accord and the guys like we don't have a

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,350
Honda Accord

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,970
no a Honda Accord sorry we don't have

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,410
rings for a Honda Accord I can't find

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,440
out he under a court here on my thing

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,259
not he and I Honda I couldn't get him to

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
understand and I had to go to a

00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,170
different shop in order to buy the

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
things and he wasn't doing it on purpose

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,830
he just didn't understand but I needed

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,100
the ring so I had to deal somewhere else

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,790
I

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,860
rebound so this is these are real

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,700
pictures from actually taking the car

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,830
apart this was my my car back then we

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,240
took everything apart replaced all of

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,960
the things that need to be replaced put

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,460
it back together again and I drove that

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,930
car through the rest of my university

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,260
and whenever there was something wrong

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,100
with it

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:56,590
I fixed it so this fast forward to 2019

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,000
March 2019 I had started to become more

00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,800
and more involved as Apache Software

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,090
Foundation

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,820
I was asked after increasing involvement

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,620
and after Aquino to Montreal I was asked

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,650
if I would be willing to run for the

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,620
board it was a little trepidatious it

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,620
was a little scared but I've been

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,550
watching the board mailing list since

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:25,630
2017 so I kind of knew what I was

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:26,590
getting into I thought in some ways I

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,570
didn't know what I was getting into I

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,870
knew that there were fights I knew that

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,300
there were that it was about oversight

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,720
that the board did more reading reports

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,710
and giving suggestions and asking gentle

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,970
pointed questions then it does actually

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,620
forcing things or doing things I knew

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,860
that I don't think I really be

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,930
comprehended the emotional impact the

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,930
way it feels to be a member of the board

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,530
but we've accomplished a number of

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,820
things or rather the foundation is

00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,890
accomplished a number of things under

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,720
our oversight we aren't doing the work

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,150
it's all of the volunteers who are doing

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,100
the work so when I say we I mean we in

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,450
the sense of I'm really proud of y'all

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,150
I'm really proud of y'all we have done

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,860
our 20th anniversary celebrations we're

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:19,720
putting on our second big conference

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,940
this year we have done amazing things in

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,080
the projects together it's wonderful

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,670
reading the reports and seeing the

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,140
progress of projects are making towards

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,980
solving their problems their community

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,350
problems their technological problems we

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,140
also did something we we met for the

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,790
first time in Chicago and we did

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,320
something well met face to face rather

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,550
for the first time in Chicago and we did

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,500
something

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,500
there in Chicago that I'm really proud

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:51,370
of we started a diversity and inclusion

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:57,720
initiative we understood that it was

00:06:51,370 --> 00:07:01,139
controversial we understood that it was

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:06,340
wanted but not completely understood

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:07,840
when we did it anyways and what we did

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,580
there was we made it possible for

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,080
volunteers who want to do the work to

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,460
step up and vault and do the work to

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,460
have a space in which to do that work

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,490
so what have I learned along the way

00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:32,389
learn a few things and I wanted to share

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,389
those lessons here

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,629
remember the Chilton's good

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,159
documentation is critical it's not

00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:42,719
everything I wouldn't have been able to

00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:45,930
do without my dad but if I remember

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,759
stepping into the treasurer's role there

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,889
were things I could not have found would

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,919
not have known how to do would not have

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,050
been able to do without an email that I

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,460
got at the beginning from Phil who was

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,199
assistant treasurer at the time who

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,939
would said you need to subscribe to

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:08,580
these lists you need to register with

00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:10,289
this this portal you need to watch out

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,110
for these things and this is where the

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:15,300
information is so good documentation

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:21,930
it's not everything but it's where you

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:23,279
start what else have I learned well

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,129
remember that guy who couldn't

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,039
understand me on the phone he wasn't

00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:31,020
doing it on purpose and she wasn't

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,570
trying to block me but he didn't

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,099
understand and it didn't matter why he

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,099
didn't understand I had to go around him

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,199
when people are making things hard it's

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,449
not because they want to hurt you it's

00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:47,579
not because they are they have different

00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:51,180
goals but that doesn't matter sometimes

00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:54,180
you have to just go around them with all

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,160
love and and understanding and empathy

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,160
you still have problems to solve

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,260
going back again to my experience

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,730
Overhaulin that engine with my dad I

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,020
could not have done that alone I could

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,410
not have even thought of doing that

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:18,610
alone and Apache is that times a

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,080
thousand don't try to do this alone now

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,820
if I go through and I think about all of

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,980
the ways that the various volunteers

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,870
have stepped up and helped I'm gonna

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,150
name a few but I know I'm not gonna get

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,430
anywhere close to everything I saw it

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,280
Trevor grant put on the Apache Road show

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,960
in Chicago and I saw him to step up and

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,640
accept the treasurer role shortly after

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,980
he got his membership for the first time

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I saw rasullah in last year in North

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,260
America

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,730
I saw her volunteer to run that

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:51,460
conference and run it with a prophet and

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,840
I see her stepping up again for 2020 and

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,450
I have a little bit more appreciation

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,910
now for what that means and I'm amazed

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:03,850
I'm just really really impressed

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:05,770
I see Sharon foga constantly invisibly

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:10,450
supporting everybody on the comdev list

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:13,180
I see in front every day and they're not

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,030
volunteers and it doesn't matter because

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,220
they act like volunteers anyways they

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,160
are friendly they are kind they are

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,410
helpful even to difficult customers they

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:28,420
try to understand what's going on behind

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,760
the question I see kris boots who picked

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,560
up tack despite all of the ways we made

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,260
it difficult for him by putting the

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:42,760
conference's too close to each other he

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:45,040
picked up tack and made it work I saw I

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,840
see Ted gunning and Danni Angus and Dave

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,240
Fischer who stepped up to the board when

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,100
we needed somebody and it was a

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,710
difficult job and they knew it was a

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,720
difficult job and they stepped up

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,150
anyways and especially Ted had decided

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,150
he was ready for a break he needed a

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,620
break and he'd stepped up anyways and

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,810
these are just a few of the things I'm

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,510
this is just I'm hoping to make a

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,520
representation of the way in which all

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,200
the volunteers at the foundation step up

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,460
and make a difference and the board

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,680
doesn't do

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,820
there's with the exception of the actual

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,220
three members of the board I mentioned

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,660
the board doesn't do this the board just

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,040
tries to make it possible to do this but

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,490
people still have to decide that they

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,320
want to make this our foundation and

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,800
want to change things and improve things

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
for the better

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,280
and again hammering on that point if you

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,870
can't do it alone the board has been

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,870
incredibly emotionally supportive of

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:50,140
each other this stuff is difficult and I

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,730
don't think I don't think I can really

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,710
express here on the stage how difficult

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,020
it is but I see the board standing

00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,390
together and supporting each other

00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,440
emotionally we don't always agree that's

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,080
not what I'm talking about when I talk

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,400
about supporting each other there are

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,100
definitely things where we have real

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,870
important substantive disagreements but

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,760
we respect each other and we understand

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:14,920
that each of us is there with the goal

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,140
of making the foundation successful and

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,300
moving the foundation towards the goal

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,830
of software for the public good and

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,780
because each of us understands that all

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,730
of the rest of us have those as goals

00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:31,270
even when we have a substantive

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,630
disagreement we know that we have each

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,190
other's backs emotionally and that is an

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,970
incredible feeling even in the most

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,280
difficult of discussions and that's

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,350
about all I have to say but I'm going to

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,550
open it up for questions now if you guys

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,560
want to know anything about what it's

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,800
like to be on the board this is the time

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
to ask

00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Shawn

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:06,850
ask me next year I'm not going to answer

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,850
that question now

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:24,520
so remember I got on the list more than

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,320
a year before I got on the board because

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,270
I was a VP of a project at that point

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,800
the most surprising thing at that point

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:36,790
was the way people yelled at each other

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:38,500
on the list that was not in keep my

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,260
expectations in bit developed by the

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,430
general incubator list and their people

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,940
disagreed

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,170
sometimes even loudly but they kept it

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,890
within the ranges of what you're willing

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,890
to do in public

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,330
the most surprising thing after I joined

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,720
the board it's not really a surprise I

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,490
shouldn't have been a surprise but I was

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,090
still surprised by how long it takes to

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,800
go through the board reports especially

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,410
before the Chicago meeting when we had

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,790
to finish like I was flying a couple of

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,480
days before the meeting started I had to

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,830
finish a little early it took me a long

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,200
time to go through those reports and I

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,050
wanted to get them done and it was there

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,810
were some long days also while packing

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,250
and yeah it it shouldn't have surprised

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,750
me I mean I can do the math it's like

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,250
okay if I have one record and it takes

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,270
this long then how many how much is it

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,010
going to take if I'm going to do all of

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,180
these reports but it's different when

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,110
you're doing it then when you're

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:38,430
actually thinking about it see

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,430
erratically any more questions Roman

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,030
what do you think we should do to invite

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,970
more sort of diverse voices to consider

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,340
running for the board actually invite

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:57,790
them do what you Roman did with me and

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:59,290
say hey it open your eyes look around

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:03,250
you see the people who have who are

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,540
talking already and who are saying

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,800
things that you might find a little

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,240
unexpected and and and asked him if you

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,850
can nominate them and then nominate them

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,620
or apparently a veteran did it to

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:20,500
Isabelle without asking her first the

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:22,120
first time just nominate them I've know

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,010
I've talked to one board member who said

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,390
like I wasn't sure like nobody nominated

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,019
me I would have accepted a nomination

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:36,439
but nobody nominated me until

00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:37,790
so yeah look around and and ask and I

00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,899
mean it I know that takes a little bit

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,870
of effort and I know you're also doing

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,790
it so but that doesn't just have to be

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:51,350
done by board members anybody in the

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:53,660
community can do that what do you

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,329
suggest - if somebody is interested

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,850
about the work of the board how the

00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:01,430
non-members can follow it so the board

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:04,850
reports are published after one or two

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:08,149
months so the majority of the committers

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,089
couldn't follow clothes leader work

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:13,629
right this is not a problem you have to

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:16,399
solve this is a problem we have to solve

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,110
yes a lot of what happens on the board

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,470
list is in transparent if you're not a

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:24,290
member I think that we should try to

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,850
make more of it transparent I would like

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,730
to see more of our conversations going

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,449
on on the dev that community list

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,629
especially because we're talking about

00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:34,220
community issues you can follow that

00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,720
list not as much as I would like us

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:44,569
going on there I'd like to see us move

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:46,750
more of our conversations there any more

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,750
questions

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,160
are you sure there are no more questions

00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:03,480
because I'm gonna stand here and make

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:06,449
sure ah Justin just a second kiddin

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,010
thank you what else have you been proud

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:14,520
to achieve in the six months that you've

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:15,870
been on the board this conference I'm

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,819
not doing this as a board member I'm

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,970
doing this as a conference chair but

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,350
I've been and it's it's difficult to

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,640
stand up here and say I'm proud of this

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,429
conference because I did not do it alone

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,480
look around you there's like I can't

00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,740
even see every because of the lights

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,960
that there's at least five people in

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,880
this room who who are involved very

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,590
deeply in making this happen but still

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,490
I'm proud of this conference I think

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,490
we've done a good job here

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:48,299
question back there thank you for the

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,350
talk I stepped in a little bit late so

00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:56,130
sorry if you already answered this

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,559
question but I'm a new member since this

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,539
year and I'm very passionate about the

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,659
apache software nation so really glad

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:05,340
that happen but um one of the first

00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:08,610
things I did actually was subscribe to

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,330
the members in Port Magnus of course and

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,710
I was really shocked to be honest like

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,679
about the discussions going on there

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:21,090
like mostly related to genuine diversity

00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,200
and like I'm very supportive of this

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,470
initiative I think it's great that

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,950
Apache you know has border like

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:33,149
foundational initiative but m.i.c they

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:36,029
seem to be a lot of a lot many heated

00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:37,860
discussions around this initiatives and

00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:40,470
I was just wondering it seemed to have

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,870
calmed down but you know as a new member

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,870
it kind of shocked me and I was curious

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:51,750
how did you perceive this and what did

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:56,460
the board do to like solve this fight

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,809
these fights that were going on so this

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,529
was not the first time we had talked

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:05,760
about diversity and when you see a

00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:07,110
conversation become have a large number

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,250
of emails I think May we had over a

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,200
thousand emails to the board list

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,940
when you see a conversation like that

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,170
it's often because the conversation has

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:19,000
already happened and hasn't been

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:20,860
resolved before the other times that it

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,110
happened I also had not yet joined the

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,240
foundation so I'm in one since I'm in

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,640
the same boat with you I entered as a

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,580
member in 2018 I'm only a member a year

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,760
longer than you are how are we gonna

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,290
solve this or how what are we already

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,180
doing this all this I can tell you what

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,490
I personally try to do within that

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:46,570
conversation I tried to stop responding

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:51,790
I tried to not become a part of the the

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:54,280
cycle I don't think that's enough I

00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,590
think that's a start I think that's

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,180
something an individual can do I think

00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,980
we need to continue the conversation

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:05,890
about how to improve that because I

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:07,390
think it is problematic so I as as with

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,210
many problems on the board I can't give

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,520
you a simple answer I can't give you a

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,990
we're going to do X Y Z and it's done if

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:20,070
it were that easy we would have already

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:23,080
done it sure yeah I think it's like

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:28,600
important point not to participate in

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:33,010
this fly flame the shitstorm over

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:36,460
however you call it and yeah I just also

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,710
thinking like what can I do - yeah I

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,660
mean I tried not to not to do that and

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,480
post something positive instead I think

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,820
that's a great idea to do and I think

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,660
yeah we're in a way better place now so

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,650
I'm glad about that

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:53,470
Thanks I think we're running out of time

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,960
I don't want to make problems for the

00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,280
