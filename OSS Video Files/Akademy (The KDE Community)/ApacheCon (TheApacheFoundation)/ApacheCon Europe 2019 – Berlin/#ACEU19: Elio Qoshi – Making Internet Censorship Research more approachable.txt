How do you design a user experience to guide both newcomer activists as well as the advanced data researchers?

As part of my role at Censored Planet I have explored this question. How can we empower researchers and activists make use of our data and findings. Our tools measure internet censorship in 170 countries automatically by quering requests without putting individuals at potential risk.

During this session we will go over the Censored Planet methodology and why this work is so important for Internet Freedom and Freedom of Speech. We will have a look at an overview of the new design system and visual identity which aims to support making the user experience easier and more accessible for researchers. During this process we have been going through some interesting challenges which not traditional digital products don't come across often.
