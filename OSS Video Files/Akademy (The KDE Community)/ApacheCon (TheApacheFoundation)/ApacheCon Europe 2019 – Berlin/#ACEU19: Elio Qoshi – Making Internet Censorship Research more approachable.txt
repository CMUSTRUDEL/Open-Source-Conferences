How do you design a user experience to guide both newcomer activists as well as the advanced data researchers?

As part of my role at Censored Planet I have explored this question. How can we empower researchers and activists make use of our data and findings. Our tools measure internet censorship in 170 countries automatically by quering requests without putting individuals at potential risk.

During this session we will go over the Censored Planet methodology and why this work is so important for Internet Freedom and Freedom of Speech. We will have a look at an overview of the new design system and visual identity which aims to support making the user experience easier and more accessible for researchers. During this process we have been going through some interesting challenges which not traditional digital products don't come across often.

yeah hi everyone I'm a Leo I'm actually

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,940
in the same company Renata is wera

00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:21,200
and yeah I'm also a proud member of the

00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,000
core team of open source design thanks

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,190
to Victoria for organizing this I have

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,039
not been too much involved in organizing

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,039
all of this so it's really good to be

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,039
here I'm also a tack speaker at Mozilla

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,890
which supports me being at these awesome

00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:39,620
events and talk about topics which

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,780
Mozilla cares about which is a lot of

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,190
topics including also internet

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:49,010
censorship and I'm actually on a new

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,010
adventure and I'm in academia recently

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:56,329
which is kind of weird but it's also new

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:59,000
so I am a designer and researcher at the

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,390
University of Michigan

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,659
it's remote so I I don't like stepping

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,899
on the US but it's fine because I can do

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:12,920
it from Berlin and yeah we do internet

00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:15,979
censorship research so what we're going

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,020
to talk about today as a few things I

00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,789
know we are in a design track but I

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,529
would also like to talk about internet

00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:24,409
censorship research and the importance

00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:26,719
of it before we go into the design

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,299
aspects so we're going to talk about

00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,450
censored planet the project what it's

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,450
all about

00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:37,969
Kazakhstan a country you don't hear a

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:40,759
lot from but lately there have been some

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:42,849
internet censorship things going on and

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:48,380
I would like to talk about that and

00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:50,209
because of that also show to you how we

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,819
can make our internet research more

00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:55,310
approachable and more relatable to

00:01:52,819 --> 00:02:00,909
people with better design and better UX

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:05,200
and what else we are up to in the future

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:08,810
so censor planet is is a system and

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,959
software suite based in the University

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,610
of Michigan which allows to measure

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,920
internet censorship all around the world

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,740
without actually being there so because

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,930
there's a lot of censorship go

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:27,430
in countries like Iran and Turkey and

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,990
China of course it's always hard to go

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,690
inside these countries and do research

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,480
because no one wants to do that it's

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,600
quite threatening to do that on the

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,310
ground so we have developed a system

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,400
which can measure internet censorship

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,280
remotely in the comfort of our nice

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,930
University in Michigan we can measure

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,010
all this stuff happening all around the

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:54,700
world so this has a few advantages we

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:58,090
are able to query a lot of measurements

00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,100
through our time every hour all around

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,900
the world that means we can see what is

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,290
happening all around ours if there are

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,990
political protests we can see if there

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,030
is something happening because during a

00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,450
lot of protests internet is getting a

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,220
shutdown the opposition website is

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,160
getting shut down it's a lot of

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,040
interesting stuff happening also in this

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,570
case we don't risk volunteers lives

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,510
being on the ground contributing

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,510
measurements as well so it's pretty safe

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,740
yeah we have basically we have VPSs

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,780
rented all-around wealth and we control

00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,570
them and we can just query data

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,820
throughout them and get the data back

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,720
and see if there's any difference

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,330
between them so we compare two

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,750
measurements basically the measurements

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,150
from our own country where or a

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,040
connection which is not censored and we

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,740
compare it to the connection in that

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,180
country and comparing these two we can

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,580
see if there is any interval

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,930
interference going on of course it's way

00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,910
more complicated than that but I'm not

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,010
so smart and I'm just a designer so I

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:13,180
cannot talk about all these algorithms

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,709
going on but that's the nutshell so

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,770
there's this I want to tell you a story

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:21,489
about this and so you can understand why

00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:25,540
this is so important so a few a month

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:27,940
ago or two months ago Mozilla has done a

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,479
change in Firefox and they blocked a

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,090
certification authority from Kazakhstan

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:38,610
certification Authority is the authority

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:43,499
which publishes HTTPS certificates so

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:47,379
you have a secure encrypted connection

00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:50,800
so what was happening is that Kazakhstan

00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:53,169
wanted to surveil their users by doing

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,770
their own home Pugh certification

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:59,080
authority and they told all the users in

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,999
Kazakhstan that for their own sake and

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,860
their own security they should install

00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:05,050
it because they could get into

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,439
cyberattacks from other countries and

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,529
whatsoever and this this certification

00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:14,259
authority was not trusted by browsers

00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:18,580
luckily and the users would need to

00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:22,060
install it manually and during that time

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,029
users were not able to access sites so

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,060
they were being forced to install it and

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:31,199
being surveilled so this started in July

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,139
and we tracked it just three days ago

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,080
three days afterwards until today so we

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:42,580
have data on this situation for quite a

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,770
few months the RISM domains are affected

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,050
and biggest telecom provider in

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,330
Kazakhstan was doing this Kazakh telecom

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,849
and this can be tricked outside the

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:55,569
country so luckily we didn't need to

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:58,529
travel to Kazakhstan and the funny thing

00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:02,889
is that the domains triggered were

00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:05,589
pretty popular social media Google and

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,839
all this kind of kind of website which

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:11,919
people use on a daily basis and share

00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:16,300
personal stuff so it was quite creepy in

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,249
my opinion however after our research

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,649
has been published and this has become

00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:23,319
quite a big thing because Google and

00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,089
chrome a Google Chrome and Mozilla

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,419
Firefox blocked the certification

00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:30,550
Authority the Kazakhstan cousin's

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,310
president said that we should don't

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,659
worry it's all good we are all saved

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,389
this is for your own sake

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,289
so I guess Kazakhstan thinks that this

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:47,069
is a great success and I don't think so

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:47,069
personally but yeah these there's

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,389
there is some understanding of the

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,850
situation and the reaction was quite

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:58,330
fast so Google Mozilla stopped it right

00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,460
away and we were quite happy that this

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:05,139
got a lot of traction on the different

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,270
media's okay enough about all this

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,340
creepy politics so let's talk about

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,340
design so understanding the importance

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,470
of this stuff makes you think that how

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,810
can we make this more approachable to

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,140
people that this is something important

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,590
but academia is really bad at making

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,680
things more approachable so I'd like to

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:29,730
contribute to that so one the thing

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,140
which I think is the most important is

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,720
accessibility and this starts from the

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:39,820
colors so we started with a new color

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:44,970
scheme which is wch accessible which is

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:48,280
the w3c accessibility guidelines

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,140
so before we failed a lot of

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:55,510
accessibility guidelines but now we use

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:58,210
the mineral UI color palette it's it's

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,590
very easy to implement because most of

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,990
the all of the components are

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,570
accessibility ready so if you really

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,190
don't want to spend time on doing all

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,350
this stuff from yourself you can just

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:12,460
get these colors and adapt it to your

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:16,510
project so you can see for example that

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,880
teal 60 is already accessible some

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,000
people complain that they don't want to

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,010
they want to see the colors pop but in

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,630
my opinion it's way more important to be

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:31,570
accessible we also did a small

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:37,180
rebranding of the project so this was

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:41,380
the logo before yeah it it had no vector

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,659
version which is sad and the colors were

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,230
way too bright it was not noticeable on

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,760
many different backgrounds but we also

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,480
didn't want to make a huge change we

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,650
just wanted to clean it up make it very

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,760
understandable on many different sizes

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,260
so the new logo is simply a reiteration

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,130
of the old one

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:07,210
just a cleaner one we also use the

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:10,570
typeface Barlow which is in honor of

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,580
Perry Barlow of the founder of PFF it's

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,430
it's a very good font in my opinion it's

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:20,260
also open source so you're all free to

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:24,220
use it to explain all this different and

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:27,070
complicated history like we also have a

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,650
censorship case in Russia going on we

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,750
also create creating infographics which

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,700
can make it easier to people to

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,110
understand what is happening because if

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,800
you get a research report which is

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,090
hundred pages just black on white

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,090
certain number of people won't be able

00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,400
to dive into it so we also worked on it

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,800
for graphics which explains the timeline

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,400
of in this case the timeline of Russia

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,220
censorship starting in 2007 going into

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:58,210
2012 about all the different things

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,640
which were happening 2017 we're in

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:04,650
telegram was started being censored in

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,140
Russia and what's what's day to day its

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,450
24th October so in one week we will have

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,930
a new law in Russia which comes into

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,210
force so the single telecom operator in

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:20,320
Russia will be able to control all of

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:22,630
this censorship going on so I thought

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,260
that was relevant today since we are one

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:32,200
week ahead far away from that new law

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:36,660
coming to force we also doing quite a

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,610
few publications so we worked on

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:43,300
designing the layout design of these new

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:47,650
publications I don't even want to go

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:51,550
into the cliche cheesy stock photo stuff

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:55,030
of nodes and whatever so we took a more

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,250
abstract approach which I think might

00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:03,820
have been a bit more suitable for in

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:07,200
this case so yeah I can really explain

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,200
it's just like abstract art

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,540
and the illustration part is not really

00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:19,749
ready yet but we started experimenting

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,179
and this was I thought it was also a

00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:23,470
good opportunity to show to you that

00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:28,419
about this new project which is open

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:31,059
doodles it's a small public domain repo

00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:32,949
with different doodles illustrations

00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:36,189
which people can use in their own

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,100
projects and we are using them just

00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:43,479
brighten up the mood to lighten up our

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,369
materials when it's necessary of course

00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:48,279
when working with journalists Human

00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:52,419
Rights journalists we try to set the

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,339
tone right but in this stage for example

00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:57,160
I think it's appropriate to you to

00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,929
lighten up the mood you are you are free

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,689
to use that as well there are over like

00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:04,329
30 or 40 illustrations it sets a good

00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:07,079
base to start a new project of course

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,729
once you have set new identity a new

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:16,389
branding you might want to do something

00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:18,160
yourself from scratch so yeah that's

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:22,029
basically what we have been doing until

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,359
now and we want to do even more in the

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:27,579
future 2020 we want to do data

00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:29,019
visualization guidelines data

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,669
visualization is something very

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,519
important which brings the message home

00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:36,939
in my opinion but also its lacks a lot

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,639
of accessibility and underst making it

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:44,109
clear to people so we want to work on

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:47,559
that and so all of our research makes

00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:51,039
more sense to anyone who reads them will

00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:54,639
have new websites which i think is kind

00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:58,029
of outdated now but we got to fix it

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,739
very soon and a lifestyle guide instead

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:02,079
of a PDF where we have all the

00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,429
guidelines our life style guide will be

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,039
able to give to you

00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,189
and we component every color fonts all

00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:14,079
the kind of stuff to to make new

00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:15,939
materials yourself so yeah that's

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,519
basically you know nutshell what we've

00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,319
been doing in the last months you can

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,680
get involved and you can check out the

00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:25,699
websites

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,029
and ideally you can get involved by

00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:30,800
yourself but I I know how hard it is so

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:34,009
please reach out to me if you are

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,519
interested in that topic and I'll be

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:40,300
gladly able to help you and I hope you

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,100
learned a bit about censorship and are

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,149
curious to learn a bit about it more in

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:53,179
the future as well

00:13:44,149 --> 00:14:00,550
thanks for coming do you have time for

00:13:53,179 --> 00:14:00,550
questions any question comments critic

00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:10,319
thanks for the talk you said you have

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,779
volunteers in different countries and I

00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:14,369
am from Turkey and I have a family maybe

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,259
they might be a volunteer but how do you

00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:18,449
ensure the safety of the volunteers on

00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,339
the ground yes

00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:23,069
we don't have volunteers in different

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,499
countries I used to work on a project

00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:28,139
before part of the Tor project called

00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:29,969
uni which uses a different method so

00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:34,679
volunteers inside these countries need

00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:36,959
to use measurements on the ground this

00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,829
project of ours actually does not

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,339
require that

00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:43,799
so we every one of us we live in the

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,659
United States and Germany and we are not

00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,539
in these countries so we just

00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:52,439
automatically query them we just rent

00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:55,289
out servers in these countries so the

00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:59,939
safety even hypothetically the safety of

00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:03,529
all people is fine and there are no

00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:03,529
volunteers involved basically

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:29,530
any other questions comments that well

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:34,030
my question is this method of

00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:38,080
measurement is easily attackable all I

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:41,560
have to do is to trace the Renta jiz

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,690
from from whatever and shut those

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,910
servers down

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,380
well the servers are located in the

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:52,000
University of Michigan

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:54,420
so our servers shutting them down in a

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,640
university would be kind of problematic

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,350
but if you you might be able to shut

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,330
down the service we rent out in

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:05,350
different countries exactly I was

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:08,020
talking about it yeah I don't want to

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,380
say something wrong but because a my

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,480
knowledge is limited in details but the

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,960
amount sheer amount of servers we rent

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,990
is so huge I'm not sure if they are able

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,480
to do that because we are renting out

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,820
hundreds of servers in countries we are

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,220
interested in so in Kazakhstan we had

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:30,480
hundreds of servers during this use case

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:34,410
I'm not sure if they would be able to

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,410
shut down hundreds of servers

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,550
on the design side of things you said

00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,569
you're planning on coming out with a

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,620
lifestyle guide

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:54,649
do you have software decided on it what

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,750
you're gonna use to produce that at or

00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:00,380
are we in the past few years we've been

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,230
working pretty steadily on that we

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:06,380
mostly do our style guides in Jekyll

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:09,380
which is a static page generator and we

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,329
keep improving up on that and for the

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,309
next project we usually use the old

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,699
style guide of another project and keep

00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:19,189
building up on that so that's what we

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,500
use I think it works so fine it's it's

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:25,400
quick it's fast it's open you can track

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,490
changes easily it's also everything is

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,000
open so you are free to use that if you

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:34,400
know your way around Jekyll quite a bit

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,820
do you does open source design have that

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,440
listed in their resources that's a good

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,960
question I don't think we have it the

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,780
style guides targets were created is it

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,679
under our resources I don't think it's

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,919
it's in our repo in our repo repos and

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:59,470
issue tracker but yeah we should include

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,470
that and the resources as well thank you

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,940
cool thanks for coming I'll be around

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,690
all day together with our other open

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:17,029
source design folks Thanks

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:17,029
