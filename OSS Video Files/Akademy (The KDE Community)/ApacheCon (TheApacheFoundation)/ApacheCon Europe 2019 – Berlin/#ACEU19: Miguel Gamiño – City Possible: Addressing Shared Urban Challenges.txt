	Full title: City Possible: Addressing Shared Urban Challenges By Harnessing the Super-Power of Collaboration
More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/city-possible-addressing-shared-urban-challenges-harnessing-super-power-collaboration

Cities across the world have more in common than we think. Despite differences in location or language they are all grappling with the same societal, political and environmental issues that come with accelerated urbanisation. Yet all too often cities are operating in isolation, trying to reinvent the wheel or unable to connect with like-minded individuals. But increasingly cities are working hand in hand with peers, industry partners, academia, local communities and NGOs to co-design joint responses to shared challenges. Cities have been getting “smarter” for thousands of years – any new technology needs to ensure that we bring the entire community along and leave no one behind.

This talk will discuss how a new model for urban collaboration (City Possible) can help make our cities more inclusive and resilient – and how it can harness the super-power of open source.

so thank you very much for for having me

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,879
here it's been pretty inspiring ii4 a

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,910
little bit more background I was a

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,670
startup tech founder I'm not an engineer

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,980
so I am the least smart person in the

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,620
room absolutely so don't ask me those

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,780
questions but what I do what I have had

00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,510
a whole career kind of figuring out was

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,030
how to find problems that really

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,960
mattered to people or to businesses and

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,269
to find technological approaches to

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,510
those solutions and particularly given

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:44,600
what was just discussed about the role

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,329
that technology should play in

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,609
problem-solving and the responsibilities

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:52,469
that it has because of the gravity of

00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,190
impact it can have on society I think is

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,690
absolutely spot-on I think that we have

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,420
to think about what we're trying to

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,500
achieve before we think about too much

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,620
about how we intend to achieve it and so

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,719
during the course of my career I when I

00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,130
look back I find that I've done that

00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:16,350
pretty consistently and I found my way

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,229
pretty accidentally into this civic tech

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,740
space and that's what I want to share

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,030
with you because I didn't when I was

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,430
building these startups in building

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,770
early cloud services before we called

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,740
them cloud frankly I didn't know kind of

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,890
the the impact I didn't understand the

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,280
context in which I could use technology

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,659
to accomplish the the goals that we were

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,119
trying to achieve and so I had to find

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,340
that kind of the the old-fashioned way

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,799
by living through it and so now I think

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,960
not only is part of what I'm here to do

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,359
to inspire hopefully inspire you to

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,969
think about leveraging your talent

00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:01,020
leveraging the the genius in this room

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,149
toward civic challenges urban challenges

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,520
that have a the ability to profoundly

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,179
impact society but also to think about

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,890
how that might affect the the technology

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,170
that we're developing on why cities in

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,120
particular are so important so I'm going

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,000
to start with some numbers because I

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,849
think that might appeal to the room

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,610
again I my I started my journey in the

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,370
Civic tech space pretty emotionally and

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,750
accidentally and was just benefited by

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,579
hindsight to realize that I had

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,989
accidentally ended up in a really

00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,180
important place and the reason that that

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,549
place is so important is that more

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,620
people today live in urban centers than

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,569
do not for the first time in modern

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,190
history fifty-five percent of the

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,760
population lives in urban centers in the

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,560
world and a full Singapore six million

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,200
people moved to urban centers every

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,109
month in the world so the projection is

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,650
that seventy percent or so of people

00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:59,790
will live in these urban centers bite by

00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:03,720
2030 and some estimates are that that

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,450
could be even higher so all of the

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,859
things that even were just discussed in

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,030
the African context many of those social

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,730
challenges and pressures exist in

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,019
slightly different forms in these urban

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,060
centers all over the world and when I

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,480
say urban center I don't only mean New

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,449
York City or Paris or London or Berlin

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,040
but I also mean those right in the

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:27,989
middle of New York City we're finding

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,569
people who are not connected to the

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:34,489
Internet when I was in San Francisco I

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:39,449
remember a study being done by by us

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:43,620
finding that a hundred thousand people

00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:47,310
in San Francisco the self proclaimed by

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,060
some extent to some extent center of the

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,530
technological universe a hundred

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,739
thousand people were unconnected or

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,389
under connected to the Internet arguably

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,480
experiencing many of the same challenges

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:03,989
that were described existing in Kenya

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,230
just a moment ago only a little maybe

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,449
even more dangerously obscured by the

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,049
surroundings that they that they exist

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,669
in in New York City is a million people

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:19,019
unconnected or under connected in New

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:20,729
York City and so we have to think kind

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,490
of very clearly about what that means

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:25,650
what the urban center means to the

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,349
application of Technology and the and

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,389
the forward moving progress that can and

00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:33,330
should be made in an inclusive manner

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,849
in society so the other thing that that

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,909
I discovered along the way that now we I

00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,310
have the benefit of a slide to describe

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:43,439
is that it's also where the global GDP

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,060
is generated eighty percent of global

00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:50,669
GDP is coming from the same urban

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,379
centers ninety percent of patented IP is

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,270
coming from these urban centers meaning

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,490
the resources and the technology is

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,569
being created in the same places where

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,639
this societal strife exists in real time

00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,120
it's also the source of many of the

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,069
globe the globe's problems the the

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,219
majority of co2 emissions coming from

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:13,409
urban centers so it was really

00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:15,270
interesting to me and again I discovered

00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,699
it kind of accidentally and emotionally

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,949
was that I was finding myself in the

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,259
place where we had the opportunity to

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,830
leverage the world's greatest kind of

00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:30,029
access to resources against the world's

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:34,740
most existential most grave issues and

00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:39,930
impact and more importantly involve the

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,370
most people in that process so we could

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,960
have you know in the startup days

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,789
everything was about scale right nothing

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,879
mattered if it didn't scale this is it

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:50,000
this is this is my my social impact

00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:54,930
version of that this is where I can have

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,550
impact at scale it's not to just to

00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,460
suggest that rural centers are less

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,479
important they're just not as easily

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,460
scaled so this is where we've centered a

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,229
lot of our discussions or at least in my

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,150
team the other thing that is how I

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,669
mentioned that a full Singapore is

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,669
moving into these urban centers well

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,990
they're moving from somewhere else so

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,839
there's a lot of discussion about

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,930
diversity and typically we we talk about

00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,839
that first of all in in from the comfort

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,199
of a Twitter account but secondly we

00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:31,229
talk about it in the context of

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,000
ethnicity and gender typically but I

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,889
suggest to you that number one that's

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,169
happening in these urban centers but the

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:41,669
urbanization migration is is going to

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,300
drive diversity whether we like it or

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,950
not

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
because these people are moving into

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,830
these urban centers and they're coming

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,550
from somewhere else so by definition

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,350
they're driving diversity now the

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,450
inclusiveness of that diversity I think

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,490
is the really important part and

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,170
thinking about and Merle and I chatted

00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,880
about this yesterday so I'm gonna give

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,180
her credit for this but deep diversity

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:07,620
it's not just the I don't know what

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,270
happened if that's okay but the it's not

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,130
just about gender and ethnicity but it's

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,870
about what your experiences are what

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,610
your background is what your assets are

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,770
what your talents are all of those

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,080
things everyone in this room even though

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,610
many of you might look the same in terms

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,310
of your skin color or your gender

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,350
everyone in this room has as or most

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,740
people in this room have arrived here

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,770
along a different path and so that is I

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,880
think something that is not in that

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,680
statistical slide I just showed

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,320
but maybe one of the most important

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,570
assets that is that is building not only

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,070
exists but is growing in these urban

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:46,830
centers is the ability to engage diverse

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,300
perspectives in that IP that 90% of the

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,660
world's patented IP that's being

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,040
developed Canon should be informed and

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:58,590
and influenced by these diverse

00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,570
perspectives kind of building on a

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,180
comment made on the in the previous

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,400
presentation that just because you can

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,960
doesn't mean you should I think you know

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,670
I experienced this from a city's

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,160
perspective that just because I had the

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:14,910
resources to build a solution on my own

00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:18,480
doesn't mean I should but often we did

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,970
because we believed it to be faster we

00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,830
believed it to be more efficient and

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,190
more effective to just get on with it

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:29,730
and not always involve people in the

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,980
process and I think that again brings

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,140
true to what was discussed previously

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,630
and so I've described to you the

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,020
environment that is cities that it is a

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:43,410
place that is becoming more diverse with

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,590
or without our influence we can leverage

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:49,170
that opportunity but in a in a in a time

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,150
when people are finding themselves in

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,540
closer and closer proximity to one

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,330
another

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,400
aka that kind of part of the definition

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,750
of urban urbanization

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,150
are they are we really more connected

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,570
are we are we really collaborating more

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,430
are we really inviting people into that

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,560
development process into the solution

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,960
process into the process of moving

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,670
society forward and into the process of

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,620
addressing some of these big urban

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:21,930
challenges and I offer to you that

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:23,880
largely not and I I think that was when

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,580
I was invited to come here and speak to

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,740
this group I I did a little bit of

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,540
reflection and I thought to myself over

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,930
the last eight years that I was in

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,870
public service and and a another almost

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,820
decade in in start-up world I looked I

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,220
thought about it and all along I had a

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,110
consistent and a philosophical approach

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,190
to involve others and to you know some

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,220
technologists call it user centered

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:54,570
design I called it asking the customer

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,250
or asking the stakeholder and now that

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,610
was a pretty consistent thread and then

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,540
I I thought about what little and

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,980
relatively speaking little involvement

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,170
I'd had with the open source community

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,670
and what what relatively speaking little

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,230
I know about the open source community

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,570
and it felt like the underlying

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,330
principles were very very similar that

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,240
it was about engaging a broader group

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,000
the almost the intelligence of the of

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,310
the crowd and the diverse inputs that

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,160
should go into building better outcomes

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,930
and so I thought about how that relates

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,790
to the work that I've done in the past

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,170
with cities and the work that we're

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,900
doing going forward with cities and so

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,400
so this is what I'm trying to describe

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,100
to you kind of the opportunity and the

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,420
challenges and and that exists in the

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,440
cities space to get you thinking about

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,870
that as a as a venue for the application

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,480
of your talent the application of your

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,430
interests and purpose and where things

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,580
can be impacted and I'm gonna give you a

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,710
quick story about something that that I

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,260
did this is my own kind of personal

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,180
experience not only with the city

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,430
context I just described but the

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:04,770
open-source community and that the power

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:09,300
of that in San Francisco the mayor who's

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:10,140
now passed away had a dream that he

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,840
called it

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,670
in pajamas and if you ever and if you're

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,710
anyone from San Francisco ever knew Ed

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,360
Lee he was that that was that guy he was

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,340
kind of he would come up with the cheesy

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,090
line because then you couldn't forget it

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:28,530
right pretty effective and so we went on

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:31,080
this this mission to have people be able

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:34,020
to permit their businesses new or

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,880
existing in their pajamas and as cheesy

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,710
as the line might be it was pretty it

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,700
was also a pretty clear mandate like we

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,890
knew what that meant and so we went

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,960
about accomplishing that and we did a

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,320
couple of things a couple of decisions

00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,990
that I made or that we collectively made

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,620
that I can't take credit for being kind

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,510
of so forward-thinking and that I could

00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,910
predict the value of these decisions and

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:04,440
to some degree they were just happy

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:06,870
accidents we decided number one that we

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,340
were going to not presuppose the

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,880
solution that we were going to take the

00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,100
time to ask the stakeholder group what

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,310
what it meant we did did permits in

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,010
pajamas even matter to them and if it

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,500
did and how could we help really address

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,420
something that was a pain point the

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,420
second was we decided we were gonna

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,340
build it as an open source project now

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,750
we didn't have a big huge history in

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,360
open source in San Francisco our our

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,490
website stuff was built on Drupal and we

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,080
did some things but I wouldn't call us

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:43,140
you know a powerhouse of open source but

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,000
we've made that decision those two

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,370
decisions proved to be tremendously

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,120
valuable one because we went through

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:55,500
this iterative and in an informed

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,460
process to build this and so we learned

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,960
that it wasn't just about the

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,420
accomplishing the permitting process in

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,310
your pajamas it was about I didn't

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,450
understand all the different agencies

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,840
and all the different forms and

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:12,000
information that I needed to do to

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:16,440
license my new hair salon or my new

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,170
bakery or my new whatever and in San

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,330
Francisco one unique element is that

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,980
oftentimes people have a bakery and a

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,889
hair salon in one business and they call

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,379
it something

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,239
disruptive so we had these kind of

00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:30,910
elements of trying to help them

00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:33,249
understand how to engage the government

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,809
to accomplish their goal as quickly as

00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:37,179
they could and most times these people

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:39,369
had day jobs that let's face it Google

00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,079
and we're trying to create their own

00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:43,239
businesses on the side so the pajama

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,249
piece actually did matter but we

00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,139
validated some things we disproved some

00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:49,449
other things but we got to the center of

00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,669
what was really meaningful to the to the

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:53,470
end user not what the way we perceived

00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,169
it or it wasn't about this project

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,329
wasn't about patting ourselves on the

00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:01,449
back with our technological prowess and

00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:03,790
are sophisticated coding and our ability

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:06,549
to do what had never been done before it

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,889
was just simply about addressing a real

00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:11,679
need of the constituency and sometimes

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:15,009
that's that requires frankly speaking

00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,079
some courage and some humility because

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,459
you know what we ended up doing we

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:22,299
organized a bunch of information

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:24,129
websites we didn't even we didn't even

00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:25,809
digitize the actual application the

00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,389
permitting process yet and it's in

00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:32,249
version one we just simply brought all

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:36,579
these different processes and confusing

00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:39,189
workflows and opaque ain't like rules

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:42,819
and we just we just brought them into

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:46,959
one place and created this this approach

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:49,199
that would carry you through what you

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,790
needed to do for your type of business

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,889
soak a tenant again to the earlier point

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,809
not to keep referring to that so much

00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,639
but it wasn't about the technology

00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:59,589
wasn't the impressive part it was the

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,269
simplicity of addressing an actual need

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,809
that was the impressive part so what

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:07,089
happened was kind of the the validation

00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:09,789
that that was the smart approach was

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,799
that while we were expecting some modest

00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:14,100
uptick in business permitting as a

00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:17,049
result of our technological

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:22,480
contributions what we actually got was

00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:26,129
13 X increase in business licensing in

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,619
San Francisco in the first three months

00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:31,389
13 X that was like kind of hinted back

00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:33,309
to my finally I was in San Francisco I

00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,100
was the City CIO so I was like low on

00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:37,300
the totem pole in the tech ecosystem

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,209
right across the

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,459
the street was uber square Twitter you

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,720
know those were my contemporaries so I

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,790
was always in the back of the line at

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,230
the Blue Bottle coffee shop but finally

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:54,160
I had something I said hey I

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,880
accomplished 13x scale impact right well

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,330
how'd you do it

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,330
I built a online informational website

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:07,089
and the engineers in the room no offense

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:09,040
kind of rolled their eyes and Wow do you

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:12,459
how long did that take like an afternoon

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,959
maybe but it meant more to those people

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:18,490
that matter to us they were our

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:20,890
customers than some kind of impressive

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,050
code structures and I'm not speaking ill

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,360
of the technology but kind of the point

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,520
is does it matter to the to the end game

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,200
does it matter to the to the people that

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,690
you're trying to serve so that was that

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,810
was kind of ah ha moment epiphany number

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,870
one how important it was to really

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,230
listen from a from a place of humility

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,450
and with that you can get clarity to

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,000
what can have a huge impact on your

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,470
actual goal the second was the open

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,690
source piece because we have so much

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,730
success

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,589
we got awards from Ivy League schools

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,310
some in our neighborhood some on the

00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:56,620
other coast

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,570
we got awards from the federal

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,399
government we got grants people were

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,130
giving us money to do more stuff it was

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,900
amazing again all we did was build an

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:10,630
informational website but it was gaining

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:15,220
traction and so what happened which is

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:19,179
not surprising is down the coast in Los

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,370
Angeles mayor Garcetti said well if it's

00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,939
good for the bay it's good for the

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,980
valley and so he went to his CIO and

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,460
said if they can do it we can do it

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,320
better and if you know anything about

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,660
California that's about the posture

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,660
between San Francisco and LA is this

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:41,290
constant back and forth about who lives

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:44,290
life better but in this case because we

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:49,300
had built a relationship between my

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,860
office and LA City IT office they picked

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,850
up the phone and they called us

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,020
and that that part by itself is not

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,600
transformative or impressive really

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,179
because that happens all the time

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,490
fortunately but the the extent of the

00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:06,250
exchange or the collaboration if we even

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:10,420
dare call it that is hey what vendor did

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,370
you use you know what

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,720
lessons learned do you have do you have

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:19,390
a copy of your RFP you know can my

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,090
lawyers talk to your lawyers that kind

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,890
of thing and of course the answer is yes

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:31,260
yes here's a copy here's a copy cetera

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:35,380
but what we did because of our

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:38,950
unintentional genius we said let me do

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:43,690
one better for you let me put it on

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:47,250
github and give it to you and so what

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,049
happened was la took that source code

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:55,110
implemented the Los Angeles business

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:59,679
portal using our our orig project and

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:02,440
improved it and sent it back and still

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,890
to this day this is this was if I count

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,679
this is probably going on five or six

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,850
years ago and today and every time I do

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,380
this president this part of a

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,840
presentation every time I share this

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,390
story I go just before I got up on stage

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,970
I went to business la city comm to check

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:25,330
that this is still the footer on the

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:28,299
website it's credited acknowledged as an

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:32,590
open source project with San Francisco

00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:35,490
and a link to the source code that to me

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,280
was an achievement that again was

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:41,110
accidental genius will call it but they

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,360
implemented their business portal in a

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,620
fraction of the time I did it in a year

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,630
and change they did it in a couple

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,950
months and change I think I did it with

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:55,720
probably a full decimal point more of

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,520
money than they did but we got something

00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,980
back too they iterated it we sent it

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,929
back and again I'm I'm out of my depth

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,880
in a room like this to tell you all the

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,659
virtues and values of approaching it

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,080
this way but

00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:11,649
this was fairly novel this was not the

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,080
norm so that was another epiphany and I

00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:15,460
said if that if I can help accelerate

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,259
that kind of impact

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,509
in a neighboring City just simply by

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,970
answering the phone and responding

00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,549
differently and making some initial

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,940
decisions differently then how how would

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:30,009
this work at scale how can I make this

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,379
more about just a connection I have

00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:33,669
happened to develop between us in and a

00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:36,429
neighboring City and how can I

00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:40,539
institutionalize industrialize this

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,399
concept of collaboration so then I

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,349
decided I was gonna I was done with

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,349
public my public service chapter I

00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:49,389
checked that box and I ended up joining

00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:52,450
MasterCard to build the city's

00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:54,249
programming and a big part of me

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,099
deciding to come to this particular

00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:58,629
company and build this particular

00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,419
strategy was that they bought into this

00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:03,970
concept at the at the core of the the

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,249
business the DNA of the business is

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,320
partnerships our core business are our

00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:12,789
bread and butter is built on

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,999
partnerships and so when I talked about

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:18,700
okay if we're going to approach cities

00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:21,909
as a new industry a new segment a new

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:25,679
opportunity to have both social impact

00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:27,700
and commercial success we have to do it

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,169
collaboratively and they looked at me

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,149
like duh but I have to tell you that

00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,739
wasn't the that wasn't the reaction I

00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:39,849
got from some others that will remain

00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:41,919
nameless so we took that approach and

00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,320
what we've done is created a community

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,029
of cities so the strategy is called city

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,309
possible it was on up there in the

00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:50,320
corner and we took this approach to

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,210
create this framework around three kind

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,210
of core ideas this is not sequential

00:21:52,210 --> 00:22:00,099
this is not linear this is just the

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:02,559
three big elements of of engagement and

00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:05,859
one at the core of it is creating this

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,529
community of cities so we have this

00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:10,419
global network of cities that get

00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:14,769
together and talk about what their

00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:16,419
challenges are and through that

00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:18,429
discussion sometimes like San Francisco

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,409
and LA they can share so

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,240
among themselves engaged with a

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:24,220
community like you and maybe it has

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,669
nothing to do with me or MasterCard and

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,889
we're okay with that because often

00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:32,139
enough the challenges haven't been

00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:34,690
solved and they do offer an opportunity

00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:37,990
for us as an organization to make

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,879
contributions that not only accomplish

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,549
our objective of positive social impact

00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:45,730
but also accomplish our commercial

00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,289
objectives and let's face it one of the

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,450
things kind of going back to my cities

00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,639
days one of the things I used to tell my

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,490
the mayor's that I worked for and they

00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:56,169
were San Francisco and the current mayor

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,879
de Blasio and in New York I don't have

00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:01,330
to tell you what it what end of the

00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:03,789
spectrum they're on politically I had to

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,629
but I told him I said listen we have the

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:10,929
power of the pen today and we can push

00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:12,909
budgets into accomplishing our will and

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:17,980
having the positive social impact but at

00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:20,379
by definition at a specified date time

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,110
and location we have to hand that pen

00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:25,210
over to someone else called term limits

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:29,259
not everywhere in the world but lots

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,360
lots of the two places I worked and then

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:34,269
the next person can stroke the pen in

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,100
the opposite direction so but if we

00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,039
partner with the private sector and we

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,409
make it commercially viable to have

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,019
positive social impact then the private

00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:48,369
sector becomes the guardian of that

00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:50,580
social impact in that legacy and so that

00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:52,659
was again and kind of an informative

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,580
epiphany that I developed over the

00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,860
course of my time in public service that

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,570
that is really baked into this that we

00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,909
want cities to have the freedom to

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,749
engage with each other and sometimes

00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:04,210
solve things without our involvement

00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:06,309
often enough we will be involved in when

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,809
we are we're going to listen we're going

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:09,580
to build solutions that actually have

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,649
the impact that we're we're trying

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,940
collectively to achieve and we're going

00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:14,529
to do it in a way that's good for the

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,809
business so that we can continue to

00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:18,549
invest it invest in it and we can

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:22,389
continue to be the guardian of that

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:24,100
legacy to continue to not only protect

00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:27,419
that positive social impact but

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,249
potentially broaden it and grow it and

00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,260
that's the last bit of here is to take

00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:35,460
these things to scale so we'll code

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,530
we might we might hear up here a problem

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,720
from our community then we might Co

00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,730
develop the solution with a city or two

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,380
and some partners and this is the

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,020
beginning of my invitation to you to

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:51,040
think about contributions you can make

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,500
to this world of urban challenges but

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,580
then we have the the structure to take

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,800
it to scale so that we can help San

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,560
Francisco metaphorically build a

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,500
business portal and not limit the

00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:10,600
sharing to Los Angeles but extend the

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:14,770
sharing to every city on the planet so

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,170
we have done a lot of work in public

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,780
transit which is the topic of a whole

00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:24,130
different presentation and discussion

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,770
and that has maybe as much impact on

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,610
society as even things like education in

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:32,680
healthcare we can talk about that later

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:34,860
we've had a real impact there in a way

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,330
that's good for our business but is also

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:40,030
materially moving kind of the

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,670
inclusivity and access of mobility to

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:45,100
people in places all over the world and

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,140
we've got 30-plus cities and Counting

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,450
another hundred and ten or twenty and

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,450
the pipeline of cities that are actively

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,700
joining this community that we call city

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,100
possible as a framework and now we're

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,260
we're inviting private sector partners

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,510
and academics our first partnership in

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,040
the academia spaces with Harvard

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,170
University but we're engaging with

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,850
universities all over the world with

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,310
private sector companies all over the

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,190
world big enterprise like MasterCard and

00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:14,800
small startups in the valley and in

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,840
other parts of the world and the NGO

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,120
community and the point of this is back

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,680
to this notion or this concept of deep

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,510
diversity this isn't just about getting

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,700
people that look different around the

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,340
table this is getting organizations that

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,040
look different around the table so we

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:33,610
have cities in our network that are

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:37,510
Dubai and Dublin and Helsinki and San

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:41,140
Jose but we also have wall and dilly

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:44,260
Shire Australia Altamonte Springs

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,000
Florida and Aurora Illinois and that's

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:50,680
because I think we are in

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,380
living that that that position or that

00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,600
philosophy of diversity is good to build

00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,220
more robust solutions we want to hear

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,450
from the big cities what are those

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,160
challenges we want to hear from the

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,360
small cities what are those challenges

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,940
and how do we bring these things

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,970
together to build things that scale so

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:14,230
kind of to wrap up I want to I hope that

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:20,710
what I've encouraged you to think about

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:23,530
is the urban space is a place where we

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,350
collectively that can have a huge impact

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:30,280
in extremely meaningful extremely

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,780
important ways at scale mayors I tell

00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,020
people are my favorite of all

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:37,900
politicians because they have to get up

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,990
in the morning and sometimes deal with

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,750
things like climate change and global

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,680
migration and immigration things that

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,020
maybe should be national discussions

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,490
state-level discussions and they still

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,200
have to make sure that potholes are

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,300
filled and garbage is picked up and

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,030
they're very likely to run into you

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,910
their constituency at the local grocery

00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:03,400
store at the at the corner store at a

00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:05,620
restaurant so they're they're forced to

00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,440
encounter the consequences of their

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,210
decisions and so I argue that those are

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,100
the folks that have the opportunity to

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,290
have the greatest impact even in the

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,180
lives of those I mean we should be

00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:20,800
thinking about this both as contributors

00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,330
and as the recipients of this stuff

00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,720
because many of us in this room probably

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,040
live in urban centers so if we help

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,830
those things move forward and help them

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,900
move at at an accelerated pace and at

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,340
scale then we can impact the lives of

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:39,400
people all over the world and last is

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,070
that I think there's also a wealth of

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:46,620
experience and talent in this room that

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:50,170
is openly being sought by cities and

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,670
governments around the world in the

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,130
conversations that we're having with

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,470
these with these cities they're asking

00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,830
us for help making sense of their data

00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,830
sets

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:05,320
they want to understand better how to be

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,460
objectively informed data informed

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:12,350
policymakers but they just don't know

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:15,889
how and so a little bit again to the to

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:18,460
the point earlier I I say to people and

00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:20,750
I mean this very affectionately

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:24,080
engineers can't help themselves but

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,210
solve a problem all we have to do I

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,669
think is present that community with

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:34,309
more important problems and then observe

00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:36,409
the kind of global societal impact that

00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:38,509
can happen when we do that and so that's

00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:43,779
what our program is about we're looking

00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:47,149
forward to very specifically and very

00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:49,490
aggressively engaging with the open

00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:51,379
source community and even the the Apache

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,870
foundation but just the community at

00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:58,610
large to figure out ways that we can

00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:01,190
bring this superpower into this Civic

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,379
space that has such a tremendous

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,440
opportunity to impact the lives of

00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:09,100
people in every corner of the planet so

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,230
thank you very much for staying awake

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,919
and entertaining the discussion and I

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,230
hope to see many of you in the future

00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:23,589
and thank you very much

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:23,589
