Cities across the world have more in common than we think. Despite differences in location or language they are all grappling with the same societal, political and environmental issues that come with accelerated urbanisation. Yet all too often cities are operating in isolation, trying to reinvent the wheel or unable to connect with like-minded individuals. But increasingly cities are working hand in hand with peers, industry partners, academia, local communities and NGOs to co-design joint responses to shared challenges. Cities have been getting “smarter” for thousands of years – any new technology needs to ensure that we bring the entire community along and leave no one behind.

This talk will discuss how a new model for urban collaboration (City Possible) can help make our cities more inclusive and resilient – and how it can harness the super-power of open source.
