	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/navigating-asf-incubator-process

It can seem like a daunting task to bring a new open source project into the world. The Apache Software Foundation incubator can help you! Getting into the incubator and surviving incubation is straight forward when you know what to do and how to do it. In this talk, I'll be giving an overview of the ASF incubation process, the pitfalls to watch out for, and how projects become successful. I'll also give an overview of the incubator PMC, how to interact with other podlings and make your mark on the ecosystem and finally how to make it as a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation.I’ll also go over some the challenges that your project may face along the path to graduation.

but for people who don't know me and I'm

00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,540
a freelance developer I've worked for

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,480
myself

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,650
about 25 years from a bit longer now and

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,270
I got involved with the Apache Software

00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:21,820
Foundation about eight years ago and I

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,590
went joined as a incubating project and

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,790
when I finished that project became a

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,419
top-level project I got more interested

00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,340
in the Apache Incubator and I ended up

00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,200
reviewing a whole lot of releases and

00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,960
doing some other things there and I'm

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,970
currently the chair or VP of the Apache

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,880
Incubator so I make sure that all the

00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,100
puddling reports get done on time and

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,440
that the other board can see the things

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,540
are running smoothly

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,220
I'm also mentor several Apache projects

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,530
as well and I've reviewed hundreds of

00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,230
releases I noticed there was a joke

00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,640
going around at this conference and the

00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,410
last Apache con conference is that

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,940
you're not actually a real puddling

00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,329
unless I voted - one on one of your

00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,090
releases so I don't think that is the

00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,530
case and in fact is Chris here

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,720
Christopher duds no he's not here okay

00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,070
well the PLC Forex project that went

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,350
through into incubation in which I was a

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:20,110
mentor I never voted - one on there

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:22,960
releases so it's not true so everyone

00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,240
here I think who just a show of hands

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,720
who here is usually the ASF for has been

00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,120
at the SF for less than a year no no

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,210
hands one hand two hands a couple hands

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,510
okay so so I assume you know what the is

00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,670
Fe is but just a quick recap where the

00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,740
world's largest software foundation

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,409
Intel you means that but but by some

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,680
measures that we we are and basically

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:51,820
we're a place where projects can can

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,040
come to the SF and build communities and

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,369
we create open source software for the

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,580
public good and we allow anyone to use

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,720
our code just about there are some

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,000
restrictions in our license but it's a

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,530
very permissive license so you can use

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,840
it for just about any purpose I'm

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:14,560
currently there are 6901 committers 766

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,390
members 202 PMC's that's project

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,669
management committees and 50 pod links

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,180
um that number was accurate of about an

00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:23,529
hour ago

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,470
so I here was in the previous talk for

00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,870
the Apache training

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,970
project about half the hands come up

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,010
okay so I'm actually using this the same

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,660
technology here but in this case I've

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,200
actually got a script that generates

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,960
those numbers from JSON files that

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,710
wimzie provides so I know that my slides

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,910
are always up to date so which is good

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,370
it means I don't have to edit it's one

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,440
less job that I have to do so the Apache

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:54,560
Incubator is is where communities come

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:56,450
to learn the Apache way and we like it's

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,040
the it's the main entry point for for

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,459
new project so it's not the only one but

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,709
it is the main one and we really only

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,230
accept projects that have it an existing

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,450
code base an existing community around

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,100
them so you can't just come to the

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,930
incubator if you want to start up a new

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,200
project you already have to have a

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,280
project add a bit of a community there

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,500
you know this varies a little bit to

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,890
what we expect but that's that's the

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,270
main the main things um these are all

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,630
the projects in the Apache Incubator

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:30,709
this is a little bit out of date

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:33,980
can I see ya PLC freaks for example has

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,690
has actually graduated but that gives

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,970
you an idea of the range and diverse

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,900
nature of all the projects inside the

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,000
Apache Incubator at any one time so the

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,290
question is why would you actually want

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,019
to come to the Apache Software

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,239
Foundation why would you want to come

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,530
and bring your project to thinking about

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,230
it cuz if you've already got a code base

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,450
and you've already got a community and

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,900
you're already making releases what what

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,220
why would you want to do this and there

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,070
are several reasons why your project

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,470
might want to but the main reason is

00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,959
that you want adult develop that your

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,549
software in a collaborative way that is

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,250
vendor-neutral you want to try and get

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:18,709
away from a single company running your

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,060
or having control of your codebase and

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,250
there's really good reasons for doing

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,410
this because it having a single company

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,810
control your your project where your

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,200
code base means that it has a finite

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,539
life if you look at all the big tech

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,789
companies that exist today they didn't

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:38,100
exist 20 years ago there was no Google

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:41,010
there was no Facebook Apache

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,440
did exist 20 years ago just but we

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,860
intend to exist for another 50 years

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,350
probably more and so you know if you

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,910
want your project to live beyond the

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,550
current company that you're working for

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,190
or even your own personal involvement in

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,870
it and want it to continue in in some

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,100
form then you should bring it to the

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,660
Apache Software Foundation so when going

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,870
through the incubator process what you

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,000
do is that you you get accepted into the

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,200
incubator and I'll go into a little bit

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,050
about that later

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,700
and during that process you'll learn how

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,470
to do things the way that other patching

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,740
projects do this so you learn the Apache

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,590
way um we have some policies that the

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,180
perhaps particularly around releases

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:29,070
that you you eventually must all need to

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,140
follow I won't say the word must because

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,300
there's there's always exceptions as

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,880
with anything at Apache all the policies

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,380
are guidelines that have been built up

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,350
over the years and they're just a good

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,730
way of doing thing things if you're

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,830
paddling wants to do something in the

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,120
middle in a different way then you know

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,500
discuss it with your mentors we'll

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,230
discuss it with the board and you know

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,120
things can be worked out so but we've

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,660
come up with a way after 20 years of

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,400
experience of of what works well and

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,200
what what it's not the only way of doing

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,730
it but it's a we found it's a good way

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,090
of doing it to actually build a

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,310
community around your code um and we

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,040
want to foster independence so that each

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,750
person on the project represents

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,880
themselves and not the company they work

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,680
for and this is good for you as well

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,510
because it if you're known for working

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,980
on a project then it doesn't matter who

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,030
you work for you can get employment

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,880
elsewhere if need be

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,260
so it's thing and the final thing that

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,530
we want when you're going through the

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,630
incubator process is you need to clarify

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,960
where all the code came from and whether

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,780
the ASF has rights to use that and to

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,280
distribute that and let other people use

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,520
it as well so you have to go through an

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,800
IP clearance and make sure that all the

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,150
licenses if you have any third party

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,419
code in there is compatible with the

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,919
apache license so the incubating process

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:51,840
from start to finish make sure that pod

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,840
wings follow the apache way

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,960
they ensure that donations comply with

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,830
the Apache 2.0 license as I've just said

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,900
that and we also want you to follow the

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,180
structure that the the way that other

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,419
projects operate so most projects are

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,120
split into a project management

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,250
committee which looks after the

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,230
direction of the project and they have

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,440
binding votes on on releases and

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,330
committees who contribute to the code

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,080
they may also help with the direction of

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,810
the project and the more that you do on

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,280
the project the more responsibility of

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,010
your given that's that's the way I like

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,139
looking at it it's um it's a bit of a

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,389
poison chalice really it's it's like

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,710
here you go you know start working on

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,110
this project here's a couple of pull

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,370
requests oh that's great hey that was

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,290
really nice let's make you a committer

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,450
and that often makes people want to

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,180
actually contribute more and get more

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,490
involved in the project so it's a it's

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,580
sort of a sneaky way of getting work for

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,820
free I I think but you know that's a

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,930
good thing that's a good thing so we

00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
also want to ensure that all

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,560
decision-making is done in the open we

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,030
we have mailing lists which seem a

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,680
little old-fashioned to do you know

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,930
maybe it is to some some younger people

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,610
in the in the audience but by having

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,560
these conversations on the list in an

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,870
asynchronous manner means that you're

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,729
actually including other people who are

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,680
in different time zones where you're

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:19,110
occluding people who can only work part

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,030
time on the project we're including

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,270
people who have other responsibilities

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,410
like you know a family or you know

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,750
something along those lines

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,440
so by slowing down the conversation a

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,630
little bit and often that gives also

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,890
gives people time to think about their

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,650
responses and so forth

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,360
so that the the information content on a

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,940
mailing list is much much higher than

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,650
what it is on some ancient instant

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:50,040
messaging system um so I mentioned the

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,420
Apache way and there are many slightly

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,000
different versions of the Apache way and

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,160
what the Apache way means

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,420
Shane who don't thinks in the audience

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,790
but he is here at the conference has a

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,850
very good website and what he thinks the

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,950
Apache Way is and he breaks it down into

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,870
six parts which is charity

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,340
which means that it has to be for the

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,860
public good

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,290
it needs to be the license which is the

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,670
Apache 2 license is pragmatic and

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,350
business friendly which means you can

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,170
use it for just about any purpose you

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,930
want um it's all about the community you

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,060
need to have the community collaborate

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,210
to produce the software they need to

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,680
reach decisions by consensus and they

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,690
need to have diversity now that

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,490
diversity can mean different things to

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,780
different people

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,240
generally at Apache when we're talking

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,710
about it at this sort of level it means

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,530
that not everyone works for the same

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,470
company so but other forms of diversity

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,970
are also nice as well because that's the

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,590
way that you get new and interesting

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,660
ideas in your project you don't want

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,790
people who all think the same way on

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,000
your project because you're not going to

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,770
come up with that yeah it's you're not

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,850
going to have innovation there you're

00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,260
not gonna have someone to come along and

00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,820
say hey let's this is this great new

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,640
idea the Gator goes in this totally

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,980
different direction so you want to try

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:12,150
and encourage that I've talked about

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,560
merit in that you need to the more that

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,210
you do on the project the more

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,560
responsibilities are given so you'll be

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,760
made a committer and you might be made a

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,440
PM so you remember down the track one

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,820
common fault that pod links do and

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,920
top-level projects as well in some cases

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,400
is they set the commit up are far too

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,310
high it should be easy to be able to get

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,540
commit a ship and into a project as long

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,070
as you you know you show that you can

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,650
work well with other people and that you

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,450
have some some something to contribute

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,940
and that contribution doesn't have to be

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,220
code that contribution can be answering

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,470
users questions on the mailing list it

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,970
can be fixing up the website it can be

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,330
writing documentation there can be

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:54,600
writing tests for running tests it can

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,250
be involved in other community outreach

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,960
like running meetups we're speaking at

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,090
conferences or writing books or whatever

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,810
you know so it doesn't have to just be

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,070
code and again I think some modeling's

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,100
when they first come to the incubator

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,470
they tend to think we're not gonna give

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,480
someone a commitment if they can't write

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,670
code because that could be bad because

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,650
they could break something but the risk

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,450
there is actually very very small that's

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,980
any any

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,300
anything that gets converted put into

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,070
version control it's just a single

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,399
revert away so you can you can get rid

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,700
of it easily enough and everything needs

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,220
to be in the open and transparent so you

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,930
want just about everything so you want

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,420
everything in the public view you want

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,040
discussions to be occurred on the

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,690
mailing this and then this way it means

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,920
that anyone can come along and get

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:45,600
involved and they can actually see how

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,949
the project has developed over the time

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,100
because all the mailing lists are

00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:52,410
archived and they can see out what

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,910
decisions have been made previously and

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,649
they can see that you know maybe this

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,449
idea was discussed six months ago and

00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,579
decided that it wasn't a good reason for

00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,680
whatever one so you know maybe I

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,190
shouldn't suggest that again or maybe I

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,790
should so it's it's so that everyone can

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,709
participate and and finally that we need

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,180
its consensus-based development so you

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:16,440
want people to agree on a way forward

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,360
and that doesn't mean they that you have

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,190
to agree with everything all the time

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,310
it's just that this is probably the best

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,160
way that we can go forward and finding

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,990
consensus consensus can often be hard so

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,600
there's often you know long discussions

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,709
and you know some people like that style

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:38,250
of development and some don't I'm just

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:39,540
gonna skip those that's it so all

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,540
software at the Apache Software

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,390
Foundation is released under the Apache

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,269
License more correctly the Apache 2.0

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,149
license it's a permissive license so it

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:54,230
means that you can use it for

00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:56,550
non-commercial and commercial use its

00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,160
business friendly in that way

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:02,459
it's similar in intent to say the

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,589
simpler

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,350
BSD and MIT licenses which it's

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,279
compatible with and I'll go a bit into

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,279
that a little later

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,130
at an ASF project we require you to have

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,870
source headers on all the files and

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,029
there's a particular source header we

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,010
would like you to use and we like a

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,790
license file to contain the license text

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,380
and optionally a notice file I can't

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,819
think of a single Apache project that

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,709
doesn't have a notice file but you'll

00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:32,310
often run into third-party projects that

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:36,390
just have a little

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:39,180
since file and no notice file so but if

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,290
you're not an a SF project so you could

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,279
you know for example if you've got a

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,750
code base and you want to build a

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,370
community around it you could just put

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,250
that code up and get up you don't have

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,740
to come to the SF and you could license

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,460
it under the Apache License pachi 2.0

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,380
license um but if you're not an Apache

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,140
project then there's a few things that

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,820
the license doesn't force you to do you

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,040
don't have to publish the source code

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,260
though it's probably not open source if

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,510
you if you do you don't actually have to

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,370
give any changes back to the project um

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,410
and you don't have to ask permission to

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,450
use it if it's under an open-source

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,830
license then you can just take that code

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:19,529
and use it for whatever purpose that you

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:22,230
want so currently we have 50 projects

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:23,910
inside the incubator this varies by one

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,520
or two every month we've sort of stayed

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:30,150
at about this rate for this level for a

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,279
couple of years now we keep adding PMC

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,960
members incubator PMC members I should

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,690
say we're currently three hundred and

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,220
qada PMC members not all of those are

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,110
active but there's a fair number that

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,100
are and it can the list can get quite

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,200
quite busy the normal state of affairs

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,510
is that a project spends one or maybe

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,950
two years in the incubator we've had had

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,560
projects that spend as little as six

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,089
months in there if they if they if they

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,530
come to Apache and have a lot of

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,850
experienced Apache people already

00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,790
working on them then they they already

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,800
know what they're doing so it's you know

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,620
it's probably not much point in them to

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,420
stay for a long time in the incubator

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,820
and I think the record for staying in

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:13,589
the incubator was seven years and that

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,660
project after seven years decided to

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,120
take the codebase and go somewhere else

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,880
that was like there was it was never

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,100
going to graduate but that's not a bad

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,570
thing it's it's just because it didn't

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,450
find a home at Apache it's found a home

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,640
somewhere else and continues to you know

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:34,430
be developed and be a useful piece of

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:38,940
code we get between ten and a dozen

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:43,320
projects making releases a month and it

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,510
used to be about 70% of the releases

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,140
passive oh no that's actually changed in

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,670
recent time

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,380
I'll explain why that is in a minute so

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,810
the process of actually getting into the

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,660
incubator is first off you need to find

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,440
a champion and the champion will help

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,590
you

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,150
first off determine is the Apache

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,840
Software Foundation a good fit for you

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:09,060
and they will tell you you know what

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,250
what are what the process is like what

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,170
you're going to have to do to become an

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,980
Apache project what problems you may run

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:19,200
into and those sort of things so what

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,750
actually happens when a proposal gets

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,510
put up it's generally voted on by the

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,240
incubator very few provoke proposals are

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,490
rejected but that is the reason for that

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,350
is that during the discovery process

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,120
with the champion when they find out

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,380
whether they're a good fit or not they

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,080
might decide that they're not a good fit

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,870
and just not submit a proposal so it's

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,590
it's sort of self vetting really it's by

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,970
the time you've got the proposal

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,800
together and submitted it to the

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,140
incubator it's pretty certain that

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,170
you're gonna be accepted in into there

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,760
so you need three mentors to help you

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,580
guide you through the incubating process

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,140
to become a top-level project these

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,480
mentors will look at your monthly

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,420
reports initially and then its quarterly

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,160
after the first three months and make

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,780
sure that your you know your you're

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,490
writing the reports correctly and that

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,130
it contains enough information for the

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,810
incubated PMC to be able to to get an

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,430
idea of how you're progressing through

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,199
your journey to become a top-level

00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:19,290
project and that's submitted to the

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:21,000
board and it can take a little bit while

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,400
to go through this you know a few weeks

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,959
to a month something like that so once

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,350
you've put the proposal in once you've

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,880
found your champions and mentors it'll

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,430
have a bit of discussion some people

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,720
might suggest some things some people

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,920
which you can you know take on board

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,970
will not take on board and and then we

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,420
have a vote and it generally gets

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,100
accepted so once you're accepted into

00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,880
the incubator at that point the

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,560
champions role is generally over some of

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,570
them stay on as mentors as some of them

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,790
don't it just depends on that on the

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,430
person and then the mentors will help

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,720
you set up your paddling with the

00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,560
various infrastructure that's required

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,750
so you know you need to cradle a web

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,870
or wiki will version-control or mailing

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,760
lists a lot of this is is mostly

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,720
automated these days it's it's not a lot

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,030
of effort as as it used to be the other

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,740
important things is that we need all of

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,420
the committee's and these are the

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:23,110
initial committees that were specified

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:29,430
on the proposal to sign I clas which is

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:32,770
a incubator contributor sorry individual

00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:37,870
contributor License Agreement so that

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:41,170
says I when I submit code to Apache I'm

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,090
doing so under the Apache License and

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,330
and that I you know I can't I've I'm

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,280
allowed to do this basically so it it's

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,190
helped that you sometimes you might need

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,710
a software grant as well to bring the

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:57,430
initial code end it's generally the case

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,660
but not not not always so during

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,700
incubation when you're first starting

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,100
out you want to create your website you

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,960
want to learn about how to make releases

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,210
and and Apache does releases in a

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,370
particular way and refine your build

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,830
process there's some common problems

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,590
that think that projects run into at

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,920
this point generally it's one of two

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,800
things is the build process is too

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,140
complex and people can't work out how to

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,240
build your software that may be because

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,440
it doesn't have any documentation or it

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,240
may be because it just has too many

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,590
moving bits so quite often at this point

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
projects will try and simplify a few

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,340
things and the other thing is that

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,520
you're new to this and you're not

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,250
expected to get everything right so

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,470
there may be some licensing issues with

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,960
with your software your your code could

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,300
include third-party code that doesn't

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,530
have a compatible license like a GPL

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,270
license for example and so while you'll

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,940
get it working towards making your few

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,970
of your first release um you will grow

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,650
the community by adding new committers

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,570
and you also learn to communicate in the

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,390
open another big problem that some

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,920
projects modeling's run into is that

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,930
they're particularly if they all come

00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,910
from the same same company it's the

00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,360
temptation is if you're sitting next to

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,770
someone who

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,900
working on the project it's just the

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,549
turn to them and talk to them or maybe

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,350
communicate with the money instant

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:22,710
messaging if they've you know over over

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,260
there somewhere in there in the room um

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,510
so but we want to communicate in the

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,340
open and be inclusive and have everyone

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,990
who's interested in the project seeing

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,929
all that communication so that they know

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,280
what's going on so you need to

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,840
communicate on the mailing list so

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,460
generally when modeling start out a

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,400
common problem is they forget that they

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,809
need to communicate on the mailing list

00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,910
um you need to look through your code

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,590
find out where it all came from find out

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,360
what third-party bits are there or how

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,460
it's licensed and work out whether it's

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,470
compatible with Apache and all the rest

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,049
and in some cases you may either need to

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,090
remove code or you may need to rely

00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,100
since it if you want a really good

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,220
example of a project that this have a

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:07,720
look at the Apache minut project Apache

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,970
minut had hundreds of bits of

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,640
third-party code in there all under

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,080
different licenses some of the licenses

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,110
were not compatible with the Apache

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,090
License um they did a really good job in

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,070
tracking down all the vendors and asking

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,740
them permission to relicense the code

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,299
will permission to use the code so if if

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,040
you can't use the code because it's got

00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,330
GPL license in it that's not the end of

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,520
the world you can actually go to the

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,410
original author or whoever owns it and

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,040
say look can you realize this this for

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,240
me so and in most cases people happy for

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,970
you to use the code sometimes they're

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,200
not but you know that's then you might

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,710
have to rewrite it or put something else

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,660
in there so while you're doing this on

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,220
your you're building up your community

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,900
so you're now communicating

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,640
asynchronously on the mailing lists

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,910
you're making all the decisions in the

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,120
open there are other forms of

00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:01,240
communication that go on as well so you

00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,730
you know you may communicate in NGO will

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,500
get will github and as long as those

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,240
conversations are mirrored in some way

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,730
and brought back to the list then that's

00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:14,290
fine I do find project some projects who

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:15,760
have very heavy use of of get it can be

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,880
hard to follow what's going on because

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,010
of the huge volume of emails that pull

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,529
requests and comments and commits

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,299
produce

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,100
and I think infra is working on a few

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,200
things to try and make that easier to

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,740
deal with but that's that's that's a

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,779
current minor problem um we also want to

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,639
make sure that the project is is

00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,460
independent and is acting independently

00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:40,139
from any company we hope that by this

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,309
stage that they're all their committers

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:46,470
come from a wide background and and

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,610
don't you know not the majority of them

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,860
work for a single company and

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:53,730
particularly the pmc as well that were

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:56,700
the ppm say I should say correctly is

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,190
not all from one company because we just

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,409
not the way that Apache works and we

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,500
also want to make sure that the projects

00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:07,230
are welcoming to new people and accept

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,360
accept contributions from from you know

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,940
just about everyone and that they're

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,429
putting their users first so that all

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,480
the users questions are answered and

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:20,220
users are helped it's generally in terms

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,779
of this process you'll find out there's

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,440
anyone here at their public shark tanks

00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:27,360
yesterday few hands so we had three pod

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,470
lines give up and give very excellent

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,620
technical talks on about how wonderful

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,450
their modeling was and what amazing

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,149
technology they were using they said

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,559
nothing about the community they've and

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:41,730
this is the process that a lot of

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,440
paddling's will go through they'll start

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,669
thinking about it's all about the code

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,230
and it's all about this product I'm

00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,429
trying to build and by the time they

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,649
come to the stage where they're going to

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,659
be graduating it's it's actually it's

00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:54,000
not about the code it's it's about the

00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,179
community around the code and that's

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,309
what we like to see so there's two ways

00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:02,029
to get out you can either become a top

00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:05,580
level project well you can retire

00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:07,620
generally retiring is is voluntary but

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,720
we've just had a rare instance where

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,740
we've actually had a pod Ling which has

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,000
been removed from the incubator it's not

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,529
been removed because it was doing

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,299
anything wrong it was just removed

00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:23,730
because it was not doing anything at all

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:26,659
so you know it's very very rare that the

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,850
incubator will you know step in with a

00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:31,289
it's a heavy hand and you know save now

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,700
you're doing this I think it has

00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,180
happened once and twice but not in not

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,340
in recent years

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,710
and retiring doesn't mean that the

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,480
project disappears either the retirement

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,520
can mean that the project ends up living

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,830
in github for example so the code may

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,060
still live on and there's a few little

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,910
issues that you might have to sort out

00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:51,700
around trademarks maybe that's it's

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,060
usually not a big deal so I've been

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,950
talking about releases and when I say

00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,360
releases I actually mean source releases

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,640
because at the Apache Software

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,640
Foundation we just make source releases

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,290
and we have policies around these

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,020
releases and a certain number of

00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,880
requirements that we need the releases

00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,890
must be cryptographically signed so we

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,130
means that anyone can actually vet what

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,050
is in a release if you're an incubating

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,030
project it's got to have an incubating

00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,010
disclaimer and basically this disclaimer

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,660
says that you're an incubator project

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,880
and you may have not got everything

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,700
right yet so if anyone is using this

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,240
software just be aware of that we have

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,070
recently put in a new incubator

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,320
disclaimer so you cannot choose which

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,510
one that you want and the new one is

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,020
much much less restrictive it's got some

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:44,230
more words in there that say that the

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,480
licensing may not be compatible with the

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,920
apache license in here so if you're

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,810
starting out and you have a complex

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,120
project and you're not really sure what

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,590
to do i would go for this new disclaimer

00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,800
this work-in-progress disclaimer as

00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,440
we've called it because it means that

00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,570
when you're coming to vote on the

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,920
releases and the incubate of votes on

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,170
your releases they're going to be much

00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,910
more lenient because if you actually say

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,740
it's got problems will list the problems

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,680
that are in there it's even better if

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,990
you know exactly what they are then then

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,940
we'll we'll allow it but if you use the

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,210
old disclaimer and it has some serious

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,740
issues like you know you stinks a some

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,360
compiled code in there then it's

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,020
probably not going to be able to be

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,690
released so you need to follow the terms

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:32,710
of the third-party bundled software and

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:35,530
in some case dependencies as well you

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,150
need to make sure that all that

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:40,180
third-party software is compatible with

00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,920
the apache license and there are no what

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,650
i call category x licenses which I'll

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,750
get to in a minute all the source files

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,130
should have ASF headers on them and it

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,930
should contain no come

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,550
I'll code now that's not strictly to

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,560
there are projects that make releases

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,020
that do have some jars and some other

00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,080
things in them but it's it's taken on a

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:01,810
case-by-case basis in order to work that

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,960
out so again most of these things are

00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:07,480
not like this this is a way that we've

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,370
come up that works well if you think you

00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,590
can come up with a better way that works

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,140
as well you're welcome to suggest that

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,430
and have a discussion about that but it

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,410
has to have to be following the apache

00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,200
way and there has to be there's gonna be

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,610
maybe a few minor thing well a few

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,740
things that are just like now if you're

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:28,600
sorry you've got to do it this way so

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,940
the release process is that you create a

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,750
release candidate you test it yourself

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,210
and make sure that it's working the

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:41,430
puddling will then vote on it and only

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:44,620
the pod lings pmc so that's the PPM see

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:48,580
members votes are binding once you've

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,530
got three plus one votes you can then

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,660
send it to the incubator to get voted on

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,730
now generally you want to wait 72 hours

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,620
for this process to happen even if you

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,750
get the three plus one vote straightaway

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,380
and again the reason for that is that we

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,670
want everyone to be involved so it may

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,530
be that you've got some people who are

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,720
working part time on the project and you

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,030
know they they can't drop everything

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,830
what they're doing on the first day and

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,330
have a look and some fit this release

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,220
and it may be that they will find some

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,500
important it's important issues where

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,910
they will test the release and that will

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,710
find that you know there's something in

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,940
it that doesn't work so so you want to

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,620
do that and if you get if you get three

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,280
plus one votes and more votes the minus

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,960
one so a minus one vote is not a veto

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,070
you can and if you do vote minus one you

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,270
can get something you can talk to

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,680
someone and see if they can change their

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,270
mind maybe that you can say well you

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,190
know this is not really a serious zero

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,950
issue where you know we are in

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,390
incubation it doesn't have to be perfect

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,850
for the world maybe we'll fix that in

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,620
the next release is that okay by you so

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,840
you want to try and do those sort of

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,790
things so if the vote fails I it gets

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,260
more minus one votes than plus ones well

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,700
maybe a serious issue is found in the

00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,930
release count the release manager

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,450
decides to say now we're not going to

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:00,220
release this then you've got to make a

00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,690
new release candidate and go through

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,730
this process again

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,190
so then you asked for a vote on the

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,890
incubator PMC now at this point if

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:14,640
everything has gone well you will

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:16,480
already have three incubator votes so

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,190
it's because your mentors are also

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,930
incubator pmc members so um so when the

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,170
incubator votes on it and once 72 hours

00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:29,410
pass again you can vote on it so this is

00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:31,000
some rough representation of voting on

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,820
the incubator this is a little old and

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,640
so there's a few reasons why your

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,590
release may get a minus one if you've

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,500
got compiled source code in your release

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:44,770
if you include category X code which is

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:50,280
usually GPL there's there's three

00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:52,780
license categories categories a B and X

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,730
going down the list these are the sort

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,400
of in rough order of what sort of errors

00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,570
crop up um some issues with the license

00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,930
will notice file usually missing

00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:04,030
licenses with things like that some sort

00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,640
of copyright issue I've had to vote

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,750
three times on a release or three

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,790
different releases I've had to vote

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:13,630
minus one because it included a cat

00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,980
photo right don't take random photos off

00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,170
the internet that you don't have

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,460
permission to distribute particularly

00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,680
ones that are taken by professional

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,160
photographers right they're not going to

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,520
like that so and and the final one is

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:32,110
that inking contains encryption software

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:33,520
now as I was saying before sorry what am

00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,810
i second did you just had ten minutes

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,080
because I think I got 20 oh I see thank

00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:42,880
you

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,440
so minus one is not a veto so I was

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,860
saying you need three plus one votes but

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,540
more plus ones than minus ones and you

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,950
can I've gone through all this people

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,450
you can make people change their minds

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,610
you can put up conditional votes you

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,160
could say I vote minus one but if you

00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:01,600
fix this my vote is now plus one so you

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,890
know it's it's generally reasonable

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,060
amount and what we've done with the new

00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,680
disclaimer the work-in-progress

00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,260
disclaimer I think there's basically

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,640
there's it's very unlikely there's going

00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,320
to be a minus one vote in the future

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,570
it's probably gonna gonna be on maybe

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,830
10% of releases and it's probably

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,490
because they're not using their new

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,230
disclaimer

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,460
that's that would be my guess but we'll

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,550
see we've got pod Ling's who are using

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:25,770
it already and so you know that's that's

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:28,120
a good thing and you know even if you do

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:31,179
get a minus one you've got to realize

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,679
that you are learning this you are going

00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:35,080
through this process to work out what

00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:36,520
you should do as a top-level project so

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,460
you're not expected to get it right the

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,920
first time you may not be familiar with

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,950
the policies which which can sometimes

00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:48,250
be hard to find hard to understand hard

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,110
to read may change over time different

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,440
people may have different

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:58,270
interpretations of them so it's that can

00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,730
be confusing and again these policies

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,260
don't cover all situations and they want

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,110
to emphasize again that then they're not

00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:08,110
set in stone they're just guidelines to

00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,760
help you think of them as this is a

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,760
shortcut and a good way of doing

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,679
something you can take other paths if

00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,000
you want to but that's gonna be a little

00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:22,030
harder because you're gonna have to work

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,260
it out yourself so and basically you

00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,150
want to make a release that doesn't kind

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,770
contain any surprises if someone reviews

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:32,940
it that's that's the thing that I go for

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:35,110
now as well as a SF policy there is also

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,710
legal issues that you have to deal with

00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:40,480
mostly licensing so the licenses are the

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,700
apache license and any third-party

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,809
software that you include in side your

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:51,520
release you also need to comply without

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,260
licensing so an apache policy adds a

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,700
little bit more on that in that you need

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,800
if you're an a SF project you need to

00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,600
have a notice file and you need to list

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,240
all the licenses in license even if it's

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,030
not strictly required so it's just it's

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:10,440
good that it has you know everything in

00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:13,090
one single place yeah we'll do this so

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,280
some pod links have a real hard time in

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,840
doing this and it's because you know

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,580
most people who work on these projects

00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,679
are developers and then they don't want

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,860
to know about licensing stuff they don't

00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,870
want to deal with this um we do a really

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,890
good job of it

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:31,920
other projects don't

00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:35,549
- such a good job of it if you look at

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,440
some third-party repos and random

00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:40,640
projects on github you'll see all sorts

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,640
of horrible things

00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:48,540
this is a second of playing don't you

00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:51,030
just see that playing oh I gotta hit

00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,100
that oh yeah they were guess that is 33

00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,660
copies off it's playing on my screen and

00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,660
not that screen that's interesting so

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:04,080
this is from the Android project that's

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,070
thirty three copies of the BSD license

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,830
one after the other

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:15,780
all were the same text why would you do

00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:22,710
that um this one used to be under a

00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:25,310
license called the WTF public license

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:29,280
I'll let you look that up

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:37,040
they Intel complained about it so they

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,040
had to change the license this license

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:43,109
basically has clauses about dead people

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,470
using your software don't try and be

00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:48,030
funny

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:50,399
it's like it's it's just not helpful at

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:57,210
all I'll see if I can play that and see

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:59,300
what it does yeah this software might

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:05,010
not be used directly by any living being

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:08,310
slick why would you do that um this one

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:11,090
is but I think they were unsure what

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:16,920
license they wanted to use so they stick

00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:18,810
GPL on the top and BSD at the bottom so

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,869
again we can oh we do a good job of this

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:23,090
so you know don't be too concerned if

00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,950
you don't get it right the first time

00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,570
there are three main categories of

00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,630
license their category a which

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,250
compatible with the apache license and

00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,950
you means that you can use them in a

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,680
software release i'm not gonna go into

00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:40,410
detail here there are category b

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,910
licenses which you probably can't use in

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,530
a software release but you may under

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,570
some

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:48,830
answers and they contain some

00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:50,660
restriction of use of some form you may

00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:53,300
be able to use the binary form so this

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:56,090
normally is like with images or fonts or

00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,740
things like like that and include it in

00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,540
a release and then there's category X

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,080
which you can't include in a release and

00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:05,000
you can't have it as a dependency

00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,220
there's a few exceptions on build tools

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,580
and and you can also have optional

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,880
dependencies that are category X but it

00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:16,610
basically means that you can't include

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,410
GPL or any sort of non-commercial

00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,810
licenses so anywhere that puts a

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:23,090
restriction on how you can use them I

00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,200
think looking at it I don't think this

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,750
has ever actually come up on the list

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,480
but I believe the apache 1.0 license is

00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:32,750
actually a category X license so it's

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:37,640
got a advertising clause in it so it's

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:40,420
it will happen one day so um the binary

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,460
distribution is not an official release

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:46,640
we like it to comply with the same way

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,380
that the the soft the software release

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,540
does with policy so it needs to have a

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,300
license and notice file and that license

00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:57,740
to notice file may be different as well

00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:00,020
so from this from the source release so

00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,390
just what I've gone through and covered

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,860
I've covered you know a little bit about

00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,800
what the Apache Software Foundation it

00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,080
is what the process to join the

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,700
incubator by finding a champion and some

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,030
mentors and submitting a proposal and

00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,410
then the journey through the incubator

00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,990
itself where you build a community

00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:22,160
around your project and along that way

00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:23,600
you learn how to create releases and you

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,180
learn a little bit about licensing as

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,220
well and in doing that process so

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,080
finally while you get to the end of your

00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,260
journey and you become a top-level

00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,730
project there's a vote on that and then

00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,030
you're free of the incubator and we

00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,190
never want to hear from you again so so

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,630
if there are any pod links here good

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,540
luck on your journey through the

00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,870
incubator I hope that I can help in any

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:51,100
way that I can and with that I'm gonna

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,100
open it up for questions

00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,610
do we have any questions I have a couple

00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,390
that's good yeah just a quick one you

00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:06,040
mentioned for cases where someone may

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:08,300
award - one that no encryption software

00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,560
can be included could you elaborate a

00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:15,880
little bit on that yeah so I'm not a US

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,800
citizen so I don't know the full

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,090
requirements around the US export laws

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,370
and encryption software but the US

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,140
government is not particularly friendly

00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,300
and you have to get a license in order

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,850
to be able to distribute encryption

00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,470
software and there's a process for doing

00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,820
that I think the process that we have

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,100
described is a little bit out of date

00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:41,180
and I'm not 100% sure wouldn't the

00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,800
newest one is but it does mean that if

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,750
you haven't actually got that export

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
license then you can't distribute the

00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:51,170
software so that's why someone won't

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,060
vote - one on you a software thing so

00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,920
basically if there's a project which

00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,390
does require something like this yeah

00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,610
would have to go through the steps of

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,560
yep yeah it used to be that it was

00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,930
encryption above a certain number of

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,640
bits and a symmetric encryption so like

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,260
if you're creating md5 hashes or

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,230
something like that then it doesn't

00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:13,970
matter but it's you know PGP type stuff

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:19,610
so it very rarely comes up I think we

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:21,590
had another question over here I didn't

00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,470
know which one we're each session to ask

00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:27,410
but I'm curious if someone's like put in

00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:31,880
something that infringe a patent right

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:35,600
into a what's in the Apache release are

00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,720
you going to be able to like detect that

00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,310
or a certain process to go through it we

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,530
don't have tools that detect that and

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:45,170
the apache license actually has a clause

00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:48,380
in it that says that you give away the

00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,510
rights to any patents in an apache

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,610
license bit of software what but what

00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,880
happened if like the person who doesn't

00:39:52,610 --> 00:40:00,350
have the patent right like Rhys

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,700
something that and that could happen and

00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,110
then we would probably have to have a

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,480
discussion and maybe some lawyers would

00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,040
need to get involved so but you know

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,540
people

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,120
don't particularly want to try and Sue

00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,430
the ASF it's like we do work for the

00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,900
public good it's it's you know it's

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,510
gonna make you your company look really

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:25,060
bad it's like stealing candy from a baby

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:29,170
it's like so any other questions thanks

00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:32,050
for the talk yeah and what would you go

00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,990
recommend a group of people who wants to

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:37,780
go to the incubator with an existing

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:41,320
project which was primarily sponsored by

00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,610
a company that and its apache license in

00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,380
that case yep

00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:47,230
that's why the company doesn't want to

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,630
you know give up

00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,390
the source code officially like this

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,280
seems like a rather common problem I

00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,950
think and the question is what's what

00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,090
are ways to work around this I don't

00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,100
know if there is a good way to work

00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,540
around that we would require a software

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,900
grant from the original company to give

00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:07,660
permission because they own the IP so if

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,430
the developers themselves for some

00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,770
reason own the IP rather than the

00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,750
company this is going to depend on their

00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,700
contracts that they heard then then

00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,680
maybe we could work away around that but

00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,050
we we generally also don't want to steal

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,240
code even if it is under a compatible

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,070
license so you don't want to go to a

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,600
another project that is some you know

00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,790
BSD licensed software in it which is

00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,160
perfectly acceptable to use and just

00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,720
take it and use it in your project it's

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,790
it's sort of not a nice thing to do you

00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:40,930
want to ask first so I that would be a

00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:43,360
tricky situation and I would be asking

00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:45,580
for some advice on the legal list about

00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,740
that to see what it is but I'm thinking

00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:51,340
it's probably unlikely that we would

00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:56,890
accept a project that in that state okay

00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:59,920
thanks sorry do we have any other

00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,450
questions all right thank you everyone

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,930
for coming along and listening to my

00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:08,770
talk the slides here just before I

00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:16,110
finished have some useful links that may

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:16,110
help you and also this if we can

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,660
and the slides are also available on the

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,970
Apache training project so you can and

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,230
these are available under the Apache

00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,940
License so you can actually download

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,190
this presentation and use it for

00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,450
whatever you want if you want to give an

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,160
internal presentation based on this

00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,079
material go ahead if you want to cut

00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,890
half of it out and put lot more cat

00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,500
photos in it go ahead and do it so thank

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:48,849
you for coming along
