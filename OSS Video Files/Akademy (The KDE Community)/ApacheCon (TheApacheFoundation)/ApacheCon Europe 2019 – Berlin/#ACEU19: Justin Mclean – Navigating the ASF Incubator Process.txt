It can seem like a daunting task to bring a new open source project into the world. The Apache Software Foundation incubator can help you! Getting into the incubator and surviving incubation is straight forward when you know what to do and how to do it. In this talk, I'll be giving an overview of the ASF incubation process, the pitfalls to watch out for, and how projects become successful. I'll also give an overview of the incubator PMC, how to interact with other podlings and make your mark on the ecosystem and finally how to make it as a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation.I’ll also go over some the challenges that your project may face along the path to graduation.
