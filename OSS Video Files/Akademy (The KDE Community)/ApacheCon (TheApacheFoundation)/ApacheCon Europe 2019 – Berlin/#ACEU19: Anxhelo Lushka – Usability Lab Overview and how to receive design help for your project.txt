Description: 
	More: https://aceu19.apachecon.com/session/usability-lab-overview-and-how-receive-design-help-your-project

In this talk I will highlight our experience with the Usability Lab program from Open Tech Fund and how FOSS projects can apply and receive design help from this Lab.

This program offers help with Usability Audits, Usability and User Experience (UX) Consultations, Usability Testing, User Research and User Studies, UX Design and Style Guides.

Two successful examples that will be unfolded are our work on the Briar Project and Thunderbird, the difficulties we encountered and how we managed to overcome them.

hi everyone so thank you for coming I

00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:14,270
know this has been a long day and you

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,520
all must be tired so I'll try not to

00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:22,820
worry too much and not go into much

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,040
specifics so a little info about me so

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,020
my name is Angelo as alia said I come

00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,330
from Albania I'm a computer engineering

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,760
student and I work as a UX and UI

00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,350
developer or a design which is a local

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,870
company that was founded in Tirana

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,760
Albania and I'm also been a core member

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,810
of open source design for almost a year

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,210
and a half now

00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,370
so if you have any question about open

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,670
source design you can ask me or any of

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,800
the people here that were before also if

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,840
you want to contact me you can find my

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,450
email and my social profiles on my

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,870
website I don't have a twitter so I'm

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,870
sorry about that so the agenda for today

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,690
is very simple I'll go over what the

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,409
open Technology Fund is as any of you

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:11,840
heard about on technology fund before

00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:14,299
okay yeah usual faces so I go abroad

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,560
what the labs are any particular for

00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,200
today we'll be talking about the

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,119
usability lab and then I will showcase a

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,549
few works that have you done by the

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,740
usability lab and the process behind it

00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,749
and after that we can go over how you

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,670
can apply for help if you have an open

00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:30,469
source project which is related to

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,889
security and privacy so you can apply

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:35,899
for help at the usability lab and then

00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:38,990
if you have some time in the end we can

00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:42,319
have some questions as answers so I'll

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,789
be starting with whatwhat's OTF so OTF

00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:49,189
is an organization which is founded in

00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:51,880
2012 as a program of Radio Free Asia and

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:55,279
is sustained by some grants from the US

00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,340
agency for global media it's also based

00:01:55,279 --> 00:02:00,499
in Washington DC and OTF supports open

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,840
technologies and communities that

00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:05,270
increase free expression circle

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,069
circumvent censorship and obstruct

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,670
repressive surveillance as a way to

00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:14,390
promote human rights and open societies

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:16,280
so what are the labs some resources that

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,350
these Foundation offers are what are

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,050
called labs

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,180
HR a general set of mechanisms utilized

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,520
by this program to offset its current

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:30,540
inability to provide long-term funding

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:34,000
support so there are a few labs that OTF

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,620
owns so these are some of the labs that

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,620
are presented here on the screen there's

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,840
a community lab localization lab the red

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,920
team led the usability lab which we're

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,130
going to talk right now

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,640
and also the learning engineering and a

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,070
legal lab so what we're going over now

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,520
is the usability lab which is a program

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,160
that offers help with usability audits

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,080
usability and user experience

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,870
consultation usability testing some user

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,570
research user studies UX design and

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,970
style guides so it's pretty much like a

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:12,640
whole package when it's related to UX

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:14,050
and how this works is that the OTF has

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,440
some providers which are called the

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,240
service providers and are right now

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,640
there are four entities or providers

00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,080
which are got the Cardian project or

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,440
okay thanks

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,420
simply secure towards box and or a

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,460
design so there's two key studies or

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,640
example that I'm going to show right now

00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:39,100
and they are the breyer project and

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,770
HTTPS Everywhere have you heard about

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,720
briar project before or the Bryant

00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:49,530
Android app great so what briar

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,910
essentially is is is a messaging app

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,830
that's designed for activists for

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,170
journalists and anyone else that needs a

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,230
safe way to communicate it's only

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,360
available for Android at the moment and

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,940
also unlike some traditional messaging

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,620
apps it doesn't use a central server so

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,030
all the message are synchronized between

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,220
the devices of the users that are

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,110
communicating with each other so the

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,690
briar project we worked with Bayer

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,850
project in a separate project to

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,910
redesign their dark theme inside their

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,820
application also some the image

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,760
attachments message views and we try to

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,710
introduce a new unique workflow which is

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,790
something that is called remote contact

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,210
feature

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,520
so this allows the bride users to add

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,460
other contact contacts without being a

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,940
person because before Breyer only had

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,370
the ability to add people in person so

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,480
you you could scan some QR code from the

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,260
person that you're trying to communicate

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:53,350
to but this made it easier so people can

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,290
communicate directly after this project

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,380
we also worked on a new life style guide

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,630
which is probably most of you have seen

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,210
like the generic style guides that are

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,610
done in a PDF format so you can just

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,290
read some tags and some colors but the

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,140
life style guide is essentially a

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:14,440
website so this one I'm going to

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,350
showcase it was made with Hugo Hugo is a

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,290
static site generator that we use to

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,070
build websites here so how does this

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,580
whole process work in the usability lab

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:30,400
so it all started with creating an issue

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,260
on our public issue tracker on github so

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,420
we use the issues to keep track of the

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,620
progress because we also value openness

00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,920
in our design studio so every step here

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,380
is documented and it's it has tags our

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,420
labels so you can also navigate easily

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:56,650
between the different projects that we

00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:59,890
have I'm going to open this link okay so

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,770
here about briar design system and style

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:06,040
guide so this was as part of the open

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:10,470
tech found usability lab and every step

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,850
of the style guide and the creation was

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:17,290
mentioned here the current state of the

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:19,360
style guide what progress there was for

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,280
example here we have the link of the

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,130
style guide while it was being worked on

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,750
the current state and we can watch the

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,050
style guide here so this is a static

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,810
generated side it's made use Hyuga some

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,680
special features it has a dark theme so

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,050
you can like change it directly it has a

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,610
getting started page how you can reuse

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,850
the components because all the

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,010
components are reused

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,380
and how you can contribute to improve

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,140
this style guide also it has a brand

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,410
page so the brand page consists of all

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,810
the colors the typography the log of the

00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,090
project itself you can see here

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,100
compositions of the logo the safe

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,660
spacing and you can also download the

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,430
assets directly and reuse them

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,810
there's also another section which is

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:14,230
called the design section so this has

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,940
all the colors all these colors are

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,910
accessible you can also see it in the

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:23,360
dark theme all the colors that the

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,550
breyer project brand uses of the spacing

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,860
which is used here but because briar is

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,750
only an Android app it is using the

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,030
material design guidelines for the

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,230
moment there's also the typography used

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,600
in the website the links the icons and

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,820
there's some English illustrations that

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,500
you can download the best part of a

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,570
lifestyle guide is that you can reuse

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,840
the components so these are some of the

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:52,570
components that the briar project uses

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,940
for example a generic alert success

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,340
which uses a green background and the

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,270
usuals like a warning is orange or an

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,200
error is bright red there's also the

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:11,420
buttons that are used the dropdowns

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:14,360
subforms and also the cards so this

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,090
whole process begun with a mock-up which

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,430
was done in figma so figma is a browser

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,470
browser-based design collaboration tool

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,650
which is similar to sketch on others but

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,860
it allows designers to collaborate in

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:31,820
real time and work on a specific project

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,520
by making changes changes and it also

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,950
makes things much easier so you can

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,950
reuse a style also in other projects

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,219
another case

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:04,790
okay so another example I'm going to

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,410
show is the story of HTTPS Everywhere so

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,870
I guess you've heard or you're using

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:12,170
HTTPS Everywhere which is a browser

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,449
extension and which automatically makes

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,910
the websites use a more secure HTTPS

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:19,699
connection instead of HTTP if the

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:23,079
website supports it so the story of the

00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:26,600
HTTPS Everywhere redesign was started in

00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,839
2018 when a designer named Glenn

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:34,190
Sorrentino he opened an issue about

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:35,660
audit and UX audit of the extension so

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,800
it was an effort to improve the user

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,320
experience and when we started this

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,720
project we went it all went through a

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,329
redesign phase so this process

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,940
incorporated all the core aspects of the

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,800
UX design we had some main objectives

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,290
that we wanted to follow which were

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,389
revamping the overall look and the feel

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,480
of the extension improving the

00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:02,029
information infrastructure the

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,920
consistency language usability and to

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,010
rebuild the components that they were in

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,350
a standardized way so they can be reused

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,690
so we were committed to ensuring the

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,010
small smooth experience for everyone by

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,339
following a user centered design

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:20,060
approach along the way and as always we

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:33,100
started with an issue on our issue

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:33,100
tracker with which we can see here weird

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:58,530
time to know it's not something okay

00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:02,310
okay that's bad UX or something like

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:04,500
that okay so we had a scope and an

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,020
action plan so what we were going to do

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,630
we started with user research and

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,450
surveys made a site map a feature

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,720
inventory we built wireframes and made

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:19,200
some mock-ups after that we create an

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,720
interactive prototype of the mock-up we

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,700
did some a be testing usability testing

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,370
and surveys with other users to improve

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,170
it we made revisions and at the end we

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:39,740
had to like hand it off to the

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:42,570
development team at the EF F so at first

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,760
we decided to start with a qualitative

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,620
research to then continue on with a

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:52,080
quantitative approach like or another

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:54,900
said in the first talk of it today so we

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,120
conducted a few iterations of usability

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,130
tests and also runs some accessibility

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,920
audits to make sure that the whole

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,020
experience ties in smoothly at first we

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,210
started with a survey which included 12

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,280
questions which were a mix of open and

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,970
closed questions and we also use

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,320
personas during the development of this

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,330
studies three different type of personas

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,390
and after completing the first research

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,730
phase we started to shave a design so we

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,970
took an interactive into an iterative

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,680
approach on the design so we did some

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,089
design mock-ups and then tested them

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:36,000
with the matching profiles of the users

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,710
so this is how the extension looked

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,940
before so you can see all this some

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:45,120
check boxes and just some domain names

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,950
and this is the first iteration of the

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,720
extension

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,680
as you can see a completely different

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,430
look with buttons with toggles and

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,920
everything else but it wasn't over yet

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,519
so this one was just the first iteration

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,410
it also had its issues for example here

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,889
it was not clear that the help icons

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,380
brings another panel with information or

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:12,110
here that what the the disabled for this

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,529
side button does it doesn't suffice for

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,810
the user or an issue about the adding a

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,260
custom rule which like there's four

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:24,199
buttons which are not clear or the

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,040
bottom door changer buttons here which

00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:29,839
are usually used for these side settings

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,540
so we worked on another iteration of

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,380
this and this is the second iteration

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,829
and we did some improvement like the top

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,410
header was now colored in blue and this

00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:45,410
indicated that the HTTPS Everywhere was

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,260
enabled also the current side domain

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,170
here or at the design standout stands

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,320
out to the user so it has an improved

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,959
typographic hierarchy and the current

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,880
side rules were nested so you wouldn't

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,920
like to see them in the same time here

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,779
so this is a nest of four rules which in

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,870
this way declutter declutter the main

00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:11,060
view also the list of the custom rules

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,990
and disabled sites was separated from

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,870
the upper part of the extension which

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,810
means it has a lower emphases and the

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:24,560
shrink also clearly shows the current

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,990
state of the extension in just one

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,209
option instead of two so earlier we had

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,699
two options as you can see allow only

00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:34,279
secure requests and enable globally in

00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:35,959
this way everyone can just see that the

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,980
extension is working and it's on

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:43,310
globally but this was not enough so we

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:47,269
made more testing with the in surveys

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:50,880
and this is a hit map so the green one

00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:54,210
shows that the participant

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:58,260
completed a test successfully in without

00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:00,420
many issues purchased directly and we

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,030
worked after these results we also

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,820
worked on a third iteration which mostly

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:09,140
polish the design of the extension and

00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,630
tackled some small usability issues like

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,370
I I cannot graph your information

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,130
infrastructure that's also a

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:30,330
presentation of this that I want to show

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:33,270
you here okay so this was the first

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,070
iteration of the extension and these are

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,890
the proposed UX for the second and the

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,370
third iteration so everything here is

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:43,830
explained with the arrows so there's a

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,200
clear disabled States which uses some

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,680
visual cues I don't know if you can see

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,260
it here but the header is now grayed out

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,810
with strips which indicates that the

00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:00,300
extension is disabled also here it has a

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,850
street great break background so it

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,380
shows that this extension is disabled

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:10,710
only for the current site there's also

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,960
the help indicators so you can just

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,890
hover over the question marks and see

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:20,940
what the string says are the tooltips

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:23,190
and we also decided to change the the

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,800
extension icon in the browser so it has

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,890
three different states so if it's a full

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,350
logo on blue color indicates that it's

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,690
enabled globally also if it's grayed out

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,680
it means that it's disabled globally and

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:39,870
if it's grayed out but with a small blue

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,380
dot it means that it's disabled for this

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,080
site but it's enabled globally also

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,800
there's some different scenarios about

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:52,380
the extension usage for example if you

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,910
disable the extension globally the site

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,160
settings just is removed and only shows

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,960
some other toggles and other extensions

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,690
for example like disabling on the

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,500
current side

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,440
another scenario which is removing the

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,970
exceptions for a website and plenty of

00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,920
other scenarios also the shows the flow

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,449
of information of information so if you

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,180
click on a more information you get

00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:29,330
information about HTTPS Everywhere for

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:32,120
example so for anyone that is interested

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,790
in the details you can also check our

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,550
project page and we also wrote a case

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:42,260
study so you can also see it in full

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:48,650
detail and depth about the work that we

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:51,130
did really ok something must be wrong

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,130
here

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,530
yeah something is broken but anyway in

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,200
this side over here you can find some

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,540
buttons on the right side you also have

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,750
the full study and also the sources of

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:22,550
the study in PDF format and also in ODT

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,840
so you can also reuse the study for

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,990
other projects that you might be working

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,330
on

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,309
so after you've seen these two examples

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,200
you probably are here because you have

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,350
an open source project that you use or

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,120
you own or something similar and you

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,620
want to get help for your project

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,650
let's say that you don't have enough

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:47,450
budget for design and so you want to

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:52,520
contact or apply at the usability lab so

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:55,309
that's pretty easy you can apply ok so

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,220
the usability lab website or open tag

00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:00,830
that fun there's a form that you can

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,010
feel like information about the name of

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:06,530
your name the project name your email

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,750
how to reach you and what services do

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:11,360
you require for example if you want a

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:15,050
style guide development you just click

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,490
the check box explain in short terms

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,830
like what's the problem that you're

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:23,150
trying to solve with this how long do

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:27,440
you expect the project to last and if

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:29,270
it's if you are not a provider which in

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,850
this case doesn't apply you can just

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,330
click now and it'll be submitted for the

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:38,780
review but this is not the only way that

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,570
you can get help from the usability lab

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,460
for example if you you can just directly

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,360
contact the four providers

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,040
via email or in person so you can work

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,970
with them to find a solution and they

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,250
can send the scope of work to usability

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:59,030
lab and get it approved faster so you

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:05,480
can work on your projects so if you have

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:07,929
any more questions here I know it was a

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,929
bit quick

00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:19,200
one sure

00:20:44,030 --> 00:21:04,210
more cops are ya sure

00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:23,960
step of the project you can seek for

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,690
help of course you can just seek from

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,820
health like from the beginning so you

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,769
can like if you are lucky the whole

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,870
project can be like Delft from one of

00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:36,409
the providers so they can go from the

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:38,210
zero to the final steps or if you have

00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:41,389
issues like you're stuck somewhere with

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,730
the a be testing or iterations you can

00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:45,529
also contact at the RTF or the providers

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,019
so it doesn't matter at what step you

00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:49,850
are you can also be just like at the

00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,970
last step if you just need like a

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,559
redesign or just some opinions you can

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,960
also just contact the providers it

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,470
doesn't mean that they have to do like a

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,840
whole project for that so it all depends

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,610
on the project but sure you can just

00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,450
apply on any step it doesn't make any

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:11,690
difference yeah you can define it here

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,279
that's one of the like official ways but

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,669
you can just contact the providers like

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,740
we are also around in many events so you

00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:21,619
can just ask us personally I mean this

00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,019
is the best way like to find an

00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:25,639
agreement or like learn what your

00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:33,369
project is missing or what do you want

00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:33,369
to fix on our project wellness yeah

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,799
Breyer well I I don't think I can answer

00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:46,970
for that because I'm not a developer for

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,730
briar but I know that they are trying to

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,240
release a desktop version if that's of

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:55,610
any use and if things go well I think

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,679
they will also release on App Store but

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,100
I think that's probably far away at

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,169
least one or two years just react to

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:07,190
that there are some battery saver issues

00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:09,710
and the iOS version so iOS does not

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,190
allow you to keep briar running the

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,740
whole time for safety security reasons

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,840
also for batteries they just kill the

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,680
background process so you cannot keep it

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,920
open

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:25,490
so it's it's pretty hard to get around

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,590
that yes also bright use a star so I

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,770
think it's a bit more easier in Android

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:35,030
since I as far as I know tor doesn't

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:42,500
have like a proper browser on iOS so

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:45,830
it's a bit more difficult welcome any

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:53,210
other questions you can ask about

00:23:45,830 --> 00:24:05,870
anything okay Thank You Angelo for

00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:09,700
finishing this track today that's a wrap

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,700
