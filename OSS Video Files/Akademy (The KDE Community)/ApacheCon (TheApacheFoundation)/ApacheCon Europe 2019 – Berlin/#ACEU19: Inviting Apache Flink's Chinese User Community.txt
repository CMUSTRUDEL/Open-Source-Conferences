The role of China in the world is changing: From the workbench of the world to the second biggest economy and a technology and innovation powerhouse. This economic and demographic growth also shows in open source communities like Apache Flink. Today, most of the traffic to the Flink website is coming from China, and most new community members come from this most populous country in the world.

Many well-known online services and communities in the “Western world” have a Chinese equivalent, as for instance Amazon and Alibaba, Google and Baidu, WeChat and Facebook. After the Flink community learned of the existence of a huge, but from our eyes hidden community of thousands of Chinese Flink users, we started offering resources specifically for Chinese-speaking Flink users with the goal to invite these users to join the Apache Flink community.

In this talk, we share our experience inviting and embracing our China-based community. Our efforts include a Chinese-speaking user mailing list or translating the Flink website and documentation. Moreover, we report on ongoing challenges and our future plans to strengthen the ties in our community.

and we are going to spend the next 15 to

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,309
20 minutes to talk about our experience

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,820
of integrating the Chinese user

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,430
community into a patchy fling my name is

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,460
Robert I'm a pmc member and committee at

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,710
the Apache fling project for many years

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,990
since the incubation and with me is

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,940
Fabian husky he's also a comedian PMC

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,399
member was also involved in incubation

00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,399
we are working for a company called wave

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,140
Erica M which is offering products and

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,690
services around Apache flink and is

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,899
owned by Alibaba one of the largest

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,359
e-commerce and technology companies on

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,489
this planet and before I start talking

00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,649
about specifics of our integration I

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,640
would like to tell you a little bit

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,649
about China and I have visited China for

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,260
the first time a few weeks ago and I

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,120
also went to Shanghai and this picture

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,520
is actually Shanghai it looks quite

00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,829
different from what you might think how

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,079
is Shanghai looks because this picture

00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,409
is from 30 years ago this is Shanghai

00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:21,390
Pudong it was just some fishing boats

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:25,439
and some small shops or like small

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:29,159
workshops today this is how Shanghai

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,710
Pudong looks it has one of the the

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,700
second largest building M in the world

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,850
and it's the financial center of China

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,950
if you look on Wikipedia about the

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,390
economic development of China you'll

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,659
find that it's the second largest

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,479
economy in the world it has managed to

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:52,109
reduce extreme poverty for 800 million

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,990
people it's middle class has 400 million

00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:59,149
people which have an income and around

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,369
10 to 50 thousand US dollars a year and

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:07,710
there are 400 billion s in China growing

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:10,920
by - each week also looking at one of

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,390
the global problems China has 40 percent

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,940
of the global installed solar capacity

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,420
looking closer to technology M 38

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,640
percent

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,610
of all global venture capital

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,610
investments are done in China and China

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,560
has most of the unicorn companies in the

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,870
world unicorn company is a company with

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,230
more than more than 1 billion dollar of

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,459
valuation only last year they added

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:43,830
almost 100 new unicorns to their startup

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,989
ecosystem and obviously the startup

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,900
ecosystem and also the existing

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:52,890
technology companies in China like $0.10

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:57,030
Baidu Alibaba and they all contribute to

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,489
a very big open source community it's

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,400
the second most active country on github

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,709
by the number of user accounts since

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,269
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,370
there are also some Apache projects

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,830
which originated in China from Chinese

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,190
companies or Chinese communities such as

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,519
Apache Debose Chi walking rocket MQ or

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,220
khylin and also if you want to have some

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,900
like anecdotal evidence and over the

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,480
about the size of the Chinese

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,670
open-source community if you look at the

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,640
trending projects on github you will

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,739
find that more than every second project

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,989
is actually Chinese so that you can see

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,709
that the description is in Chinese oh

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,900
it's from Chinese companies and this

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,630
should give you an impression of the of

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,170
the dominance that this country has in

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,570
the in the open-source space and if you

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,880
go to the github page of one of these

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,799
projects you'll also find that it's very

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,160
difficult for us from the Western world

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,530
to understand what this project is about

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,350
so it's pretty apparent that there's a

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,310
clear separation of communities just by

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:09,150
by a language barriers zooming in

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,360
further and to Apache chief link if we

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,229
look at the number of website visitors

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,910
we can see that the the biggest country

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,500
where people are coming from to the

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:25,110
flink website is China also I've added

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,060
like a long term view of the number of

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,700
users on our website and you can

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,670
actually see that the number of users is

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,100
dropping at certain events and you

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,960
correlate them also to the Western

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,590
Christmas but you can also correlate

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,540
them to Chinese New Year to Labor Day in

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,480
China there was also Labor Day in

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,170
Germany at that day but for example here

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,080
at the at the end at the right at the

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,210
National Day is a one week celebration

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,150
and this year where China basically

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,450
closed down and celebrated 70 years of

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,410
China and this has a pretty visible

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:07,640
impact on our website traffic for the

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:10,310
flink project so we noticed these

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,860
numbers and and we started looking

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,220
around and we saw that there is huge

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:20,180
meetup events happening in China with

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,030
more than 500 participants going to to

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,400
flink meetups and more than 1000 people

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,070
attending think forward Beijing last

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,520
year there will be another fling forward

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:35,480
this year which will have even more

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,240
people attending and if you look even

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,710
closer you will find that there's quite

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,440
a lot of things happening in China

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,660
relating to flink so there is a website

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,930
they used to be website called flink -

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,360
china arc which was basically a full

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,340
translation of the flink website and am

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,970
a partial translation of the flink

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,640
documentation another evidence of the

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,710
size of the chinese fling community are

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,660
to drink talk groups so ding is

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,250
something like slack in the Western

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,510
world and which has m 13,000 members

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,530
talking about flink it's mostly like a

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,330
user support mailing list and and being

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,170
in that channel is like a waterfall off

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,190
of text messages and Smiley's coming at

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,230
you so what we had to realize by the end

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,710
of last year is that two separate

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,410
communities have developed and there are

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,700
several reasons for this development

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,780
probably the biggest is the language

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:38,420
barrier it is similarly hard for people

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,000
in China to learn our language English

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,460
or another Western language as it is

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,420
hard for us to learn Chinese so I think

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,060
we have to really appreciate that

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,660
those who participate and speak English

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,410
have done I have put a big investment

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:59,070
into into learning English then there's

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,500
different tools and services and in

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,470
China people are not used to using

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:09,210
mailing lists they grew up with apps

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:12,030
such as ding talk QQ WeChat um there's

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,960
no Stack Overflow and they don't use

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,420
meetup calm and partially this is caused

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,690
by excess barrier such as the firewall

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,410
but obviously it's also caused by the

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,840
language and we were really not aware of

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,360
how big the fleeing community was and

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,620
even to that date we are not entirely

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,900
sure what what is happening um but we

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,690
also saw a huge opportunity the

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,300
opportunity to connect two of the

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,460
largest economies in the world to work

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,060
together on one open-source project to

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:51,000
get all the people that are really

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,270
motivated really smart to work on flink

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,040
to have one global community not to have

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,740
two different projects two different

00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,090
documentation two different user support

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,530
groups like everything should be

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,680
together then we have twice the power

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,190
twice the size and we can really make

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,640
flink

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,260
a bigger and more successful project and

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,750
Fabian is now going to talk about some

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,910
things with it to integrate the

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:22,410
community yes so about in the beginning

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:26,600
of this year we started actively to ask

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,970
our started efforts to actively invite

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:33,120
members of the Chinese community to to

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,180
join us to join us on the in the Apache

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,900
flink community and obviously this also

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,210
involves teaching these people the

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,600
Apache way basically bring the ideas of

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:51,180
the Apache Software Foundation to these

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:54,480
people in China and yeah so we started

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,769
we started with these efforts about ten

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,819
months ago

00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:01,860
and something that we did a first was

00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:06,119
reaching out to the maintain s of the

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,579
flink China dark website and well if you

00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:11,160
look a little bit into into Apache

00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:13,949
policies and trademark issues you notice

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,519
that it's not okay we have such a

00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:20,579
website so we reached out to the people

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,470
and taught them hey we invited them hey

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:25,679
this is a great effort I mean you're

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:29,610
translating our content this is really a

00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:33,629
huge investment and effort every awesome

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:37,049
hey would you be willing to donate this

00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:42,290
content to the Apache flink project and

00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:44,730
we started they agreed and we started to

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,739
set up a translated version of the

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,989
Apache flink website so this website is

00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:50,819
now or the content of the translated

00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:57,079
version of the website is now available

00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:59,790
enough fleeing Apache org /z h so this

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:03,299
sub follow-up basically holds all the

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,339
translated content and we started a big

00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:10,350
effort and fling with all these flip

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,660
fling integration proposal and also

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,369
defined processes how we can ensure that

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,929
the content is kept in cern when we

00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:19,980
change something on the english version

00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:23,069
of the website basically opening a tree

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,529
ratio with a specific label chinese

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:29,069
translation that people then could pick

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:31,879
up and forward the changes into the

00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,879
chinese version as well

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,569
so today the Chinese version of the

00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:39,869
website looks a bit like this

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:43,980
so you see that it's most of the content

00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:47,009
is translated and it's basically just a

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,299
simple this simple switch switching

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:52,410
between English and Chinese we also

00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:55,019
reached out to these people and said hey

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,779
if you know some Chinese companies that

00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,809
are using flaying that would like to be

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:02,069
listed on the flink power bi website

00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,790
reach out to them ask them if they're

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,499
okay with that

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,459
we also got a few positive responses

00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:09,779
there and today on we have a couple of

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:15,509
Chinese companies

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:18,449
on our Popeye website yeah the website

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,860
is pretty much translated for the

00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,910
documentation documentation is of course

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,470
a little bit of a dig a piece of content

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:29,100
a lot of things have already been

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:32,249
translated but there's still some work

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:36,660
going on to basically close close the

00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:40,980
gaps there we also started another thing

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,769
that we did was starting a Chinese

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,540
speaking user mailing list this is

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:50,939
available on the user

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:54,360
- CH @ link patriarch and we had already

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:59,459
a few Chinese speaking PMC members and

00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,620
committers and we said hey we met these

00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,759
people obviously moderators it's it's

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,100
helpful if you speak the language that

00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:09,240
is used on the mailing list so we made

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,639
these these community members moderators

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,180
for the mailing list and also asked them

00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:18,509
hey please please keep an eye on there

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,660
and try to help people coming up with

00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,600
questions and if you look at how the

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,790
mailing list evolved you see that it's

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,459
actually gaining in popularity and more

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,230
and more people are signing up and

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:34,559
actually using also the mailing list in

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,170
addition to all these groups on ding

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:41,339
talk and QQ that Robert already

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,800
mentioned so we actually can attract

00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,350
that a few few people actually should

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,959
join the mailing list and ask the

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,569
questions there and also many people

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:57,059
helping helping all these users with

00:12:51,569 --> 00:13:00,779
their questions so a few lessons learnt

00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:05,699
so the translation effort was very well

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:08,459
received we got many people who helped

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:10,259
with that and some of our commuters were

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,699
very dedicated and put a lot of effort

00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:19,079
in actually making this making this work

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:21,029
it's a good way to learn the

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,410
contribution contribution and

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,510
collaboration process and an open source

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:30,150
project because it's

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:31,880
it's a fairly easy way to get into an

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:38,970
open-source project helping with

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:41,040
translations it has a pretty low low bar

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,790
of getting into a project and once

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,220
you're in there

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,890
once you see hey what I do is helping

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,380
the community is helpful many people

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:53,190
decide to contribute more sometimes also

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,530
going into contributing source coding

00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:00,200
features or contributing in other ways

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:05,550
like help organizing events and

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:07,470
eventually you also see that that this

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,880
website is also growing in traffic here

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,890
what the what the graph here shows is

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,640
just the page views for translated pages

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:17,340
so everything everything under the gh4

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,750
does so to say you see you kind of like

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:24,600
started in in February with the website

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,480
I picked up quickly and then slowly

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:32,490
build up the big drop at the end it's

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:37,230
again the Chinese national holiday and

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:42,360
of course this only being Chinese pages

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:46,680
had a big had a pretty big impact yeah

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:50,040
so that's lesson number one more lessons

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:55,290
learned what we found fairly important

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:58,020
is to really meet members of this

00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,220
community in person getting directly in

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,540
touch with them meeting them at

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,340
conferences like fling forward china

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,430
inviting them here to the fleeing

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,080
conference that we did a couple of weeks

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,420
ago here in Berlin or in San Francisco

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,530
meeting meeting all these people in

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:20,150
person and talking with them about

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:24,180
Apache but also about any other things

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:28,200
really helps to helps to connect with

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:31,080
these people and understand their

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,040
mindset and also of course them

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,710
understanding us so this is this is

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,560
really crucial for to him to build

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,390
personal relationships because if you if

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,960
you have these relationships it's much

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:52,320
easier to really interact and solve

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:56,580
issues you should also when you when you

00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:01,040
reach out to the to china and able to

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,760
attract or build up some momentum in

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,700
over there

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,300
you should also prepare for quite a bit

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:12,779
of community growth you see that the

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,720
number of contributors in flaying is

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,880
still growing quite quickly on the right

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,130
hand side the graph shows the activity

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,940
of our deaf mailing list so there's a

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:28,920
lots of discussions happening on on

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:31,020
Flinx main list also due to all the new

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,370
members and contributors that are coming

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:39,180
from china it's also important to keep

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:41,130
an eye off or try to keep an eye on the

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,720
community that is that is organizing

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,350
themselves out of the apache software

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
foundation

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,040
osf infrastructure like everything

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,500
that's not happening on the mailing list

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,209
or not not happening on Gaeta because

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,370
there's lots of things happening Robert

00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,550
Horry said this these thing talk groups

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:02,040
with thousands of people there is a

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,439
large meetups that we don't really

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,670
notice and in this case it really helps

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,709
to have a personal relationship to

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,240
somebody and ask hey are you aware of

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:13,079
something that is going on there and

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:17,280
then try to pull try to invite these

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,819
people also to get become part of the

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,480
Apache community integration of

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:29,880
contributor says work very well many of

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,500
these of our Chinese friends also joined

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,420
discussions about community and

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,530
development processes so we had a couple

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,390
of discussions in the Flint community

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,240
how to improve a certain kinds of

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,809
processes also had lots of discussions

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,679
about bylaws for the Flint project and

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:49,290
this work very well it's a it's a

00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,700
different thing for Flint users because

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,640
also because

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,130
usually the language various more

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,289
significant talking to pure users of a

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,940
framework than to collaborators or

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:06,520
people who could contribute because

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:08,980
these people usually speak English when

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,100
you're working with people from China in

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,789
a open-source project if you should also

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,770
be aware that they use different names

00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:23,740
and nicknames across different services

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:25,539
so there is people emails on the mailing

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,450
list once your usernames entry or on

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:30,220
github and this court like for us they

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,840
look completely different but it's

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,090
always its it might be the same person

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,330
actually so that's not always really

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:40,059
easy to map people to all the nicknames

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,620
that part of the reason is they have the

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:44,380
original Chinese name they have a

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,779
chinese nickname they have a westernized

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:51,480
name that translate their names into

00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:54,730
Western characters all that can be bit

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,980
can be a bit difficult to map but once

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,659
you know like who's who it things become

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,760
much easier and finally you should also

00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:07,570
not be too scared about emojis talking

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,730
about future work we're I already said

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,730
we have lots of contributors coming from

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,429
China we also try to grow the number of

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:18,669
committees and PMC members from this

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:21,100
pool of people this also of course helps

00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:25,649
to have more people that are familiar

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:28,690
with the community over there and then

00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:32,110
helps to basically close the bridge

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,460
between those communities pushing man

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,630
list adoption further in a pear tree

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,470
something that didn't happen the mailing

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,570
list didn't happen so of course for

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,250
development processes or for the

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,289
development of the project everything

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,679
needs everything kind of need to need to

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:54,070
be sent and and also recorded so this is

00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:57,010
a principle that we are of course are

00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:02,250
following we are trying to support event

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:04,150
organisers being in a way that they are

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,540
comply with

00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,720
two trademarks and follow connect the

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,420
roots of the pages of a foundation but

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,850
we also learned trying to learn best

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,100
practices from our our friends in China

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,370
how they were able to build a large

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,640
community in China and try and see how

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:27,250
can we leverage this knowledge and also

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,510
use it to grow the flink community over

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:35,170
there as well and from our point of view

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:37,930
it's also important not to really force

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,120
them to use our tools often it's also a

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,540
matter of like integrating and seeing

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:48,070
how can we make best use of their tools

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:50,290
and practices yes and I think the last

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,140
point last point is something that's

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:55,060
very very hard and I guess not sure if

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,390
anybody is a good idea how to how to do

00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,400
that but it would also be nice to be

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,900
able to how to figure out how can we

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,060
actually enable non-english speakers to

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,490
actively participate and contribute to

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:20,470
the community yeah with that we're done

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:23,110
happy to take your questions thank you

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,210
very much that's very interesting I'm

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,510
wondering what the foundation could do

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:31,750
to help projects such as Frank where you

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:35,680
have this dual community would be useful

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,600
to I don't know have someone on the

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,330
ground in China who can help with the

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:45,810
events or have people help with

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,810
translating or what what's your view I

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:58,360
think something that is that is

00:21:51,820 --> 00:22:02,110
certainly helpful is to get people from

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,400
this culture into the practice of

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,160
commendation I think eventually this

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,990
will happen people who are contributing

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,030
contribute to other projects but I mean

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,090
if link is not the only project Robert

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,680
or he said there's also khylin once

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,840
these projects they're there there's

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,470
people

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,820
coming members and becoming more

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,620
familiar with you Patricia Foundation

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,250
and maybe also taking up more

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,350
responsibilities so just being aware of

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:31,140
the of the difference of the mindset of

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:38,850
of this culture we all will be certainly

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:40,919
helpful I think infrastructure wise it's

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,299
actually some best practices or like

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,010
working on someone like I'm not a

00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,539
guideline or best practices collecting

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,649
the the knowledge of the innovative

00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:51,929
projects like hiding like fling and all

00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:55,740
these projects that have this issue of

00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:57,539
bridging different or having part of a

00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,760
community in China and part in the

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:02,490
Western world and then an effort to

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,260
collect this information but provide

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,360
best practices there might be very

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,980
helpful it's actually quite cool that

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,570
the foundation has its own

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,070
infrastructure because at some point

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,080
people were like oh maybe we should move

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,090
to github or maybe we should stop using

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,460
all these old school mailing lists but

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,380
actually it is an advantage because um

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,850
this stuff usually doesn't get blocked

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:26,940
by by the firewall and and also email

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:30,419
usually works so that is a big benefit

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,960
and for your another aspect 5mb said it

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:36,480
i think patience and being welcomed

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,070
welcoming em is what the foundation can

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,070
do thank you

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:50,660
hi thanks for the very inspiring talks

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,710
and coming from a background of native

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,070
Chinese speaker

00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:58,070
I can totally echo on how hard it is to

00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,410
drag me drag people from the chat

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,600
environment that people are already used

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:06,290
to especially like WeChat and ding talk

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,930
that I work to also I run communities

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,880
myself and one of the promotion at one

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,920
of the efforts we made is trying to make

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,410
sure that we everyone has access to

00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,050
information and so that when they make

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,390
decisions in consensus they they they

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:24,730
have they are informed so we have been

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:29,450
pushed forward for trying to make our

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:32,030
communications of transparent which I am

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,400
a new Apache community member but I

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:37,010
learned a lot here one thing that I have

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,230
seen like for example I also contribute

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,000
a lot to Wikipedia one thing I have seen

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:45,710
in that community is they have developed

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,660
a kind of neutral way decentralized way

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,750
of forming their conversation they rely

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,820
on IRC s they rely on like they have you

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,720
some of them use telegrams and dis

00:24:52,820 --> 00:25:00,130
courts and that has its own problems as

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,290
well but in that sense they have certain

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:07,100
vendor-neutral sense of what

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:09,020
communication happens and in return the

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,530
other what we learn from Wikimedia

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,920
Foundation is they have archives that

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:18,890
actually trying to archive things from

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,780
the other channels so that when people

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,240
need to make informed decisions it

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,430
doesn't necessarily have to be a so on

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,950
that channel but it can be archived and

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,500
be searchable to whoever wants to be

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:33,110
participating in this discussion maybe

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,810
that's something to echo like what

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,150
foundation what the Apache Software

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:41,330
Foundation may be able to do another

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:44,150
thing I personally as a user is trying

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,040
to communicate with people who speak non

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,810
like language that I can also book and

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,830
on Facebook there is an interesting

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:53,000
feature that like whenever there is a

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:56,299
discussion in the language I cannot

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,070
speak it will show a trans translation

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,679
button and I can click and I can get

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:03,589
into the discussion maybe this something

00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,679
can be done on the archive of a party

00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:09,349
mailing list so people who speak non

00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,799
like now English could start to get more

00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:14,539
and more involved in this community it's

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,609
actually quite a lot of people in our

00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,459
community translating a lot of stuff

00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:21,320
like also community things community

00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:24,080
updates there's like a Chinese community

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,700
update every week that summarizes what

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,820
is happening in the Flint community on

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,739
the deaf mailing list so it it's quite

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:34,729
nice that also from the from this side

00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:37,009
there are people really motivated yeah

00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:38,869
so actually we are kind of running late

00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:43,249
so any more questions can be taken

00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:44,959
outside okay so if it's a ghost question

00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:46,099
so it's a one-shot find a question and

00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:53,710
then we take the rest of the questions

00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:58,829
offline okay okay thanks a lot thank you

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,829
