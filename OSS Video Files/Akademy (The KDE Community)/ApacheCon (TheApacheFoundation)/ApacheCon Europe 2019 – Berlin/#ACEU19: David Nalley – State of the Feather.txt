first of all let me say welcome to

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:13,020
Apache con if I'm just curious how many

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,180
of you this is your first Apache con we

00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,039
raise your hand the rest of you look

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,550
around see how many new faces that we

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,380
have joining us I'm also curious how

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:28,460
many people are not committers on any

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:32,060
Apache project okay look around at that

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,300
first of all please let me welcome you

00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:39,270
into being a part of our community and

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,730
this is our this is where we come

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,470
together and spend time in person and

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,230
not on a mailing list and that's pretty

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,560
exceptional at Apache because virtually

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,720
everything we do ends up in a mail one

00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,520
of the interesting things that we talked

00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,860
about over dinner last night was that we

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,750
had sent roughly 20 million emails and

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,270
the history of the Apache Software

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,009
Foundation and we still have all of them

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:15,119
and that's it's amazing just how much we

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:18,060
do so my purpose here today is to talk a

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,609
little bit about the state of the ASF

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,100
and to tell you a bit about where it's

00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,819
headed in the future five years ago I

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,710
had the opportunity to give a keynote at

00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,990
Apache con Europe and I focused

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,499
completely on the external impact that

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,280
the ASF had had on the world and that's

00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,710
fascinating

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,469
the impact is incredible but I want to

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,130
talk a little bit about what the ASF is

00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:49,649
doing and look more internally about

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,270
that today and a lot of folks call this

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,649
the the state of the feather are

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,749
basically the state of the Apache

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,609
Software Foundation and I think it's

00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,959
important especially since we have so

00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,179
many folks who have not been to an

00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,459
Apache con and who are not committed

00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,950
they're not part of our community

00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,130
already just to review a little bit

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,220
about what the ASF is why we exist and

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,439
what we're trying to accomplish and our

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,260
mission is to provide software for the

00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,150
public good it's interesting and and

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,360
Dirk was talking about that

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,360
incorporated as a Delaware corporation

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,549
and that's true we're also specifically

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,980
set up that we are a public benefit

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:32,040
organization meaning that we have a

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,950
legal obligation to act in the best

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,709
interest of the public at large not our

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:41,760
projects not our sponsors not even our

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:44,849
individual members our duty is to focus

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,890
on the public good and that puts us in

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:51,209
an interesting place the the foundation

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,269
the operational side of the foundation

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,340
doesn't really produce software for that

00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:01,769
we rely on individuals coming together

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,799
into a community and forming a forming a

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,840
group of people who are actually

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,280
invested in producing software and we

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,319
work on supporting that providing a

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,280
framework that allows them to have

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,459
resources and we've been doing that for

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,730
20 years and if you've been in the tech

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,290
sector at all 20 years is a lifetime to

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,669
give you some idea the Apache group

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,829
predates the existence of Google the

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:32,040
Apache Software Foundation as a legal

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:37,760
entity is about five years older than

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:41,879
Facebook so these very large dominant

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,090
organizations now are roughly the same

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,209
age that that's stunning to me that 20

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,049
years and this particular development

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:57,329
model and community focused open-source

00:03:52,049 --> 00:04:02,400
model has lived that that type of life

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:04,349
and has had that longevity and it's also

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,440
put us in a place where we are one of

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:10,260
the more important open-source

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,989
institutions around we're certainly one

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,569
of the older ones and folks are starting

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:19,500
to recognize that there's some stability

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:23,610
and that they can essentially trust the

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,320
ASF is a steward for projects but let me

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,140
paint a little bit more of a picture

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,830
because a lot of times we focus on cool

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,560
projects like Kafka or Fenner Act

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,409
and we see really interesting technology

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,810
and we lose sight of some of the the

00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:41,979
really impressive things that the ASF

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,099
has accomplished and the first is

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:50,030
ubiquitous adoption of open-source

00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:52,159
projects that the ASF ships so virtually

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,110
every piece of technology out there has

00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:57,710
some of our code living in it somewhere

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,599
and whether that's a low-level library

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,960
or it's something much higher level that

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:06,979
it interacts with it's it is virtually

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,370
assured that you were going to interact

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:13,729
with an Apache something if you're using

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:17,300
technology at all but we've also had an

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:20,560
enormous impact on the legal side of

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,300
things so the apache license has been

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,849
very widely adopted it is one of the

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,629
more frequently adopted permissive

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:32,690
licenses and it has stood the test of

00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:34,340
time a lot of a lot of licenses go

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:40,880
through a lot of changes and that's that

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:45,949
has happened very rarely for Apache it's

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,860
also kind of understated but the the

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:53,300
standpoint that the Apache Software

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:56,210
Foundation takes is often looked at and

00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:01,060
taken as the gold standard so whether

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,080
that's reaction to a new license or it's

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,479
determining whether a license can be

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,300
easily used a lot of people even other

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,639
open source organizations when they

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,800
first encounter a license their initial

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,750
reaction is has the Apache Software

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,849
Foundation said anything about this yet

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,319
let's go look and their mailing list and

00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:23,539
see what the reaction there was and so a

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,659
lot of people have grown to come to

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:30,229
trust our judgment around open-source

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:33,529
licensing but the foundation is a

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:37,340
steward and again I talked about we have

00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:39,440
this obligation to do things that are in

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,680
the best interest of the public at large

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,570
and so we're steward for a hundred and

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,370
ninety million lines of code

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,900
and that's a number that boggles my mind

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,860
one of the one of the really fascinating

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:59,090
things that Greg Stein did a few months

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,160
back is hear an analysis on on all of

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,620
our code repositories and as he's

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,100
looking at this hundred and ninety

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,690
million lines of code he's using a

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,510
formula called Kokomo which isn't

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,210
perfect by any means and he's measuring

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,910
the replacement cost if we had to start

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,280
from scratch today and replace things

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,990
like the Apache web server and Tomcat

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,500
and Hadoop and all of the other Apache

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:29,240
projects the cost to do that would

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,310
exceed 20 billion dollars that's a

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,990
mind-boggling number when you consider

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:39,080
that our annual budget is just a little

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,150
over a million dollars a year it's also

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,580
mind-boggling when you realize that's

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,210
just the replacement cost and that's not

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:51,080
the cost of that's not the value of the

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,330
software that we ship now the the actual

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,600
value that's delivered is much much

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,890
greater than that 20 billion number and

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,940
we provide all of that free to the

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,940
public and no cost

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:08,360
we've also inadvertently become a large

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:13,640
web presence we have around 35 million

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,920
pageviews per week and that's not part

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,240
of our strategy our strategy is not to

00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:24,200
become a huge target for for web traffic

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,830
but we have regardless we have folks

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:32,660
downloading 9 million copies of source

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:35,870
code every week if you look at the

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,030
monthly download stats from some of the

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,970
various distribution points like maven

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,870
central or pie-pie some of those numbers

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,290
get crazy

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,570
we have people downloading 280 million

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:53,420
copies of our software just from maven

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:56,720
central every month so very large very

00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,930
large uptake of our software

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:05,440
and we started with 21 founders and

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,180
today there are over 7,000 committers

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,710
you'll notice that one of the things

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,660
that is interesting here is the number

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:19,310
of committers who are added at any point

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,370
in time is fairly roughly the same right

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,400
we're we're not having huge up swings

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,410
generally speaking generally we're in

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,510
that same range every month which points

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,050
to the fact that we're sustainably

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,340
growing we're adding projects we're

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,420
adding folks who are working on those

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,690
projects but we're doing so in in a

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:47,420
manner that's that is not outstripping

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:50,060
our capacity for growth and there's lots

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,280
of interesting anecdotes around just how

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,040
much of the internet flows through an

00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,460
apache project whether it's the web

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:04,430
server or tomcat whether it's on your

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:08,360
phone and of course we've had this

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,160
massive impact in terms of the apache

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:17,350
software license being ubiquitously

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:20,810
adopted as well there are over 200

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:26,600
top-level projects that ship 350

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:28,730
software products and every so often I

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,130
get I get some self-doubt that comes in

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,160
and I say you know is the Apache

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,200
Software Foundation still relevant 20

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,420
years ago it was a it was a big deal to

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,140
have something like version control

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,860
available and your own project website

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,690
is the ASF still still something that is

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,810
relevant in today's society where you

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:56,090
can go stand up a source code repository

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:58,550
in 30 seconds and invariably someone

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,200
will point out you know there are people

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,010
who are coming to the Apache Incubator

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,150
every month

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:07,160
there are currently roughly 50 projects

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:09,620
that are asking to become top-level

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,790
projects at the ASF and new ones joining

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,009
every month

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,410
which is which is telling to me that

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,709
means people continue to see value in

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:22,769
what the ASF delivers which is open

00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:28,439
governance and a neutral platform for

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:31,499
folks to collaborate so this is the eye

00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:36,419
chart this is the top level projects I

00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:40,049
think I'm actually missing two but from

00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:43,709
the last board meeting this is just to

00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:47,129
give you an idea of the huge wide scope

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:52,609
of software the the ASF delivers and

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,609
that's everything from the web server to

00:11:53,179 --> 00:12:02,999
just things like Apache meso sand beam

00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:06,779
there's a huge varieties here and that's

00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:08,910
interesting to me because we're not a

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,339
Java organization we're not a Python

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,749
organization we're not a JavaScript

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,639
organization frankly we're we're just

00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:22,049
barely a software organization really

00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,449
we're a collection of people I mentioned

00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:27,449
the 50 some-odd projects that are in the

00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:29,669
incubator and here's a there's a quick

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:32,419
overview of those as well these are

00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:36,959
folks who are who see value and want to

00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:38,389
bring their project to the ASF and I

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,609
said we're barely a software

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:43,859
organization because as a number of the

00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:46,739
founders pointed out we care more about

00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:49,319
the community than we do the code while

00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:54,049
we certainly are circling around a body

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:56,639
of code it is the people that matter and

00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:58,230
the people is what we want to have a

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,159
focus on and I think that's one of the

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,709
things that makes the ASF truly unique

00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:09,209
we don't care who you work for where you

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:11,220
come from what your job title is we care

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:14,279
about whether you're contributing to our

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,459
communities and moving that community

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,439
forward and notice I didn't say you're

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,259
contributing code because a lot of

00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:27,929
people don't contribute code

00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:32,100
we care about a driving innovation and

00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:34,809
driving that sense of community and

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,839
working together towards delivering

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:40,720
software for the public good some of the

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,480
ways that we do that are we focus on

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,919
transparency so it's hard to be a

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,290
participant if you don't know what's

00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,699
going on which is one of the reasons we

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,809
focus on mailing lists

00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:54,309
we have communications that go out and

00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:56,679
it's all synchronous you don't have to

00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:59,470
be on a certain time zone or signed into

00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,629
a chat server at a specific time to know

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,869
about decisions that are being made you

00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:09,009
can see what's going on be able to have

00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:11,549
your voice heard because we have the set

00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,809
expectation that there are going to be a

00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:16,359
synchronous decision-making and it's

00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:18,999
going to happen on a mailing list where

00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:21,249
you can participate regardless of where

00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:25,179
you are in the world or what may be

00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:28,389
happening at at a given hour and we also

00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:32,379
have that focus on the people being more

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:37,480
important than than even the code that

00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:40,059
we're delivering as an end product so I

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,339
bench earlier we're at roughly 20

00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:48,819
million emails this is slide is about a

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:51,519
month old but 20 million emails across

00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:55,499
1,100 mailing lists and I'm sure that

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,839
number is is outdated and now as well so

00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:02,379
I talked about why we focus on things

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,539
like community over code but the result

00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:08,079
of that is that we've ended up with a

00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:09,939
vendor neutral place so even if you work

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,980
for a software company who's a

00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:15,339
competitor with another software company

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,019
if there's some underlying tech that you

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,350
both want to work on you can come to the

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,119
ASF and work on that and it's okay you

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,399
know one's going to look down upon you

00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:26,789
because of who your employer is frankly

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,199
we won't ask you who your employer is

00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,019
that gives our projects a measure of

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,539
Independence they don't have to worry

00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,260
about undue influence and we actually

00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:37,750
try

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,980
and shill projects to ensure that they

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,860
can be independent the fact that we've

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,380
been around for twenty years that we

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:52,570
have a known process where you enter the

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:54,130
incubator you work towards graduation as

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,870
a top-level project and there's some

00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:01,390
known expectations there that has built

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,490
up some trust people know what to expect

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,590
when they bring a project to the ASF and

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,880
they know what's going to come out at

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,890
the end they know the the known IP

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,900
policies that are going to be applied

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,730
they know what the license is going to

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,790
be they know that there shouldn't be any

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,670
surprises even in the dependencies for

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,010
those projects and that has led folks to

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:33,370
find us as a safe place that they can

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:37,450
trust and make use of and so that has

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,840
and I I apologize to Bertrand if I'm

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:43,180
taking his his homeland name here that

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,910
has made us a very neutral place like

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:51,520
Switzerland for open-source we have

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,780
created a developer safe haven where you

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,330
can come and work on interesting

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,340
technology without having to worry about

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:05,140
all of the warring factions that may

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:06,910
apply and I I mentioned earlier that I

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,820
have those moments of self-doubt where I

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:12,520
where I question is Apache still

00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,620
relevant do we still provide value to

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,690
the rest of the open-source world and

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:21,220
the tech world in general and then I

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,720
look at graphs like this that show that

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,430
we're continuing to draw new

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:32,100
contributors every single month we're

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,100
still seeing people actively working on

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,580
projects at the ASF delivering code

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:43,860
delivering documentation and that number

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,010
is is growing at an unprecedented rate

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,280
[Music]

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,790
we're not even growing linearly at this

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,570
point

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:58,770
it's it's exceeding that so what does

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,060
the foundation itself do and I call I

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,950
say that the foundation is a little

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,990
separate from the projects because

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,380
projects are allowed to make their own

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,350
technical decisions there is no one who

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,540
holds the title of chief strategist at

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,460
the Apache Software Foundation

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,740
no one says we're going to go out and

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,160
we're going to target Big Data we're

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:25,530
going to target JavaScript those types

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:29,110
of decisions aren't made so there's no

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:32,140
CTO at the Pachi Software Foundation

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,490
where we have this vision of what's

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,840
going to happen in the future from a

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,790
tech sense rather the foundation exists

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,730
as a support structure and scaffolding

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:46,360
to allow projects to deliver their

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:50,040
software so that's things like we

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,450
providing project websites bug trackers

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,080
we have the legal affairs folks who

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,030
perform things like license reviews and

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,380
ensure that our downstream consumers are

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:06,790
not surprised by license requirements we

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:10,180
have public relations committee that

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,760
focuses on getting the word out about

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:16,090
some of these projects and making sure

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,810
that they're that the world knows that

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,280
they exist and but I want to talk about

00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,080
two different parts of the foundation

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,330
that I think are exceedingly important

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,240
because I'm happy to talk about

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,960
infrastructure all the time having spent

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,900
a lot of time working on infrastructure

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,330
but when I think about the purpose of

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,990
the Apache Software Foundation and how

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:44,410
we drive that purpose further I look at

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:47,430
things like the community development

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,570
team and the conference's folks and

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,480
including the folks who are putting on

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,430
this conference this is one of the few

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,230
times of the year that Apache

00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,230
contributors can come together and

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,480
interact with each other and you heard

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,169
the founders talk about the meeting in

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,700
Sanford

00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:10,269
go and how important that was to to

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,840
build those community links face to face

00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:16,739
and I think that is doubly important now

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,739
especially as we have 7,000 committers

00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:22,509
having those personal relationships is

00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:25,059
more important than ever because that's

00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:28,960
the thing that sets us apart if I had to

00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:31,690
tell you one thing that the ASF does

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,809
that is truly unique it's that we focus

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,679
on the individual and we focus on

00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,269
empowering the individual to go and

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,059
deliver code if they want write

00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:47,739
documentation evangelize their own

00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:50,379
project and we basically are trying to

00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:53,139
get out of their way and allow them to

00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:54,909
do interesting things but that is

00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:57,100
largely dependent upon them being part

00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:00,549
of the community and in-person events

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:06,269
like this are incredibly important to

00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:09,340
building up those those relationships I

00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:14,619
personally remember one of the first

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:17,230
Apache cons I went to and you can blame

00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:18,429
rich for me being up here because he

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,499
basically said well you know we ought to

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,559
get you involved in something at the ASF

00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:26,619
and soon enough he had volunteered me

00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,989
for working in infrastructure and I

00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,489
started working there and became more

00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:33,009
and more involved at the Apache Software

00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:35,499
Foundation and that started from a

00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:38,499
conversation sitting on a couch with

00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:44,230
someone I knew only by reputation before

00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:49,090
that so that opened up a number of

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:51,429
opportunities for me I'm I'm sure that

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,440
rich is listening to this now and

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:58,119
probably regretting the fact that he got

00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,399
me involved but you know this is the

00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:02,070
this is the type of opportunity that you

00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:04,869
have to build relationships with people

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,279
you saw the number of people here who

00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,830
are here for their first time at their

00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,639
first Apache con and the number of

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,320
people here who are not committed yet

00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:15,820
this is their opportunity to get to know

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,620
folks

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:24,910
and please take advantage of that I

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:28,150
think that frankly our spending money on

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,710
Apache con is probably one of the best

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,970
investments that we can make because

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,980
it's one of the few things we can do to

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:40,180
bring people together and build those

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:43,420
human relationships up the other is the

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,250
Security Committee and Mark Hawks was

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,320
talking about that earlier during the

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,820
founders panel and that he's working on

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,180
that the ASF remember has a legal

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,630
obligation to act in the public's best

00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,550
interest we have to do what's in the

00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:09,790
public's best interest and the public

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:13,660
good and so the the focus from from the

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:16,030
security team is that they're there

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,810
ensuring that all of these projects the

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,740
200-plus

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:23,440
top-level projects are actually meeting

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,990
their obligations from a security

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,420
perspective because it's one thing to

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,840
release software it's another thing to

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,910
be responsible for it long term and to

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,570
be responsible for your users security

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:40,600
and so essentially mark runs one of the

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,550
most important product security

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,980
organizations the security committee and

00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:49,960
that reflects back on what we perceive

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,290
as our obligation to the public right we

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,820
want to ensure that our projects are

00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:02,080
timely responding to security issues we

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,060
want to ensure that consumers of our

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,790
products are actually getting notices

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:14,080
and again we go back to this focus on

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:17,320
the public good and that probably seems

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,150
to most people I'm sure it does it to do

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,770
the security community but that probably

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,170
seems to most people to be boring

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,050
especially when it's not your code and

00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,429
you're having to largely babysit the

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:32,710
process

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:35,889
for two hundred some-odd projects but

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,479
again we have that focus on we have to

00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:39,700
take care of the people who are actually

00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:43,149
consuming our software the people we've

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,940
released that to and it's a vital part

00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:57,969
of the operational function of of the

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:59,379
ASF I'm always asked of course is the

00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:02,529
ASF going to be around

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:04,989
and again I'm intend to be a pessimist

00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:07,330
and I always question you know are we

00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:10,200
going to survive another 20 years and

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:14,460
I'm happy to report that the ASF is

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,460
doing well from a financial perspective

00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:20,440
we've been for a number of years now

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,239
once we realize that you know we're not

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,639
just a group of friends who are getting

00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,940
together we've actually had a budget in

00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,749
place

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,239
we're tracking against that budget we're

00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:34,869
consistently under our planned budget as

00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:37,979
well which is which is remarkable given

00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:40,109
some of the unknown things that happen

00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:42,639
beginning a few years ago we started

00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:45,669
having the board set out a five-year

00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:47,349
vision and again that's not the Apache

00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,109
Software Foundation is going to become

00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:52,149
the home for Java or we're going to go

00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:58,029
attracted a lot bunch of big data

00:25:52,149 --> 00:26:00,339
projects the the reality is is that from

00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:02,519
an operational perspective we need to

00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:05,889
understand what what we're trying to do

00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:08,049
and what we need to be directing our

00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:12,429
energy towards whether that's holding

00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:16,029
more in-person events or offering more

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:18,129
technology to our projects and so the

00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:20,739
board has actually been producing a

00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:24,460
five-year plan for the past couple of

00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:28,629
years of looking forward five years we

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,549
also because we're starting to what is

00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:33,399
in our mind handle a little bit more

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:35,879
money we've started having an audit and

00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:40,149
we've received an unqualified audit

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:40,809
result from our CPAs and that means that

00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,029
they have no

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:47,590
survey shion's about our processes or

00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:50,919
what's actually in our reports and we're

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:53,230
also incredibly transparent so if you

00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,019
want to see what's going on with the

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,549
apache software foundation's finances

00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,039
you can find that in the board report

00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:03,129
every month you can see our budget once

00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:05,379
it's approved and of course we also by

00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:08,230
law have to make our tax returns

00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:12,570
available you can go take a look at all

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,570
of that on our website today

00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:19,059
we also have more than nine months of

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,950
operating cash reserve and that number

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:23,950
doesn't necessarily mean a lot to folks

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:27,070
but the average for a non-profit based

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:30,220
in the US is about six months so we're

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,619
we're doing substantially better than a

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:38,169
number of nonprofits that are at our

00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:42,100
size and speaking of finances we could

00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:44,080
not do this without our sponsors I would

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,119
encourage you if you interact with any

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,460
of our sponsors and I wish I could say

00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,440
that this is all on one slide but

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,240
unfortunately or maybe fortunately we

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,759
have we have so many folks that are

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,179
invested in our success but I can't fit

00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:01,840
them on one slide and I've even had to

00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:03,639
go down to text for some of them if you

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,480
interact with any of these folks please

00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:09,279
thank them for supporting the ASF and

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,499
make sure that you also thank the folks

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,999
who are sponsoring Apache County you as

00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:15,399
I said earlier I think that getting

00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:19,210
together in person is incredibly

00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,799
important so what's next

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,320
what's coming at the Apache Software

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,720
Foundation there's lots of things

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,159
happening on the technical there's new

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,659
projects coming every every month as a

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,730
matter of fact I actually participated

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:36,909
in submitting and proposal for a new

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:41,499
project as I was in the Amsterdam

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:44,019
Airport coming here so there's always

00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:45,519
going to be new projects showing up

00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:48,549
there's always going to be interesting

00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,799
things coming out of projects but if you

00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:53,619
want to have a look at our five-year

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,759
strategic plan you can see the URL there

00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:59,649
to get to the board

00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:01,299
five year plan and if you want to look

00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:05,859
at our financial standing you can see

00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:09,690
there a URL that points to a number of

00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:14,379
reports that includes our US tax returns

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:16,029
as well as a number of other records but

00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:21,279
one of the things that we're focusing on

00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:24,509
as we grow and as we try and prepare

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,849
ourselves for the next 20 years is

00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:31,179
making sure that we're a welcome place

00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:34,029
for people to come innovate it does no

00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:36,809
good for us to have projects if we're

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:40,119
all mean and grumpy and run everyone off

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:44,819
so this year the board launched a

00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:48,089
diversity and inclusion initiative and a

00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:50,249
lot of that work is around understanding

00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:53,469
where some of the friction is

00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:56,019
understanding the current status of what

00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:58,599
people think about participating at the

00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,729
ASF and that work is underway and I'm

00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:03,119
I'm actually excited to see what comes

00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:06,489
out of that what we can learn about

00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:11,849
folks and how they participate in how we

00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:16,569
can better enable that that said today

00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:18,489
we're at Apache con and I hope that you

00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:20,919
will take advantage of the fact that

00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:23,559
we're all located here this is the place

00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,169
where you will make relationships and

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,329
friendships that will last you many many

00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:32,469
years you'll end up with opportunities

00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:33,940
to work on cool tech that maybe you

00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:36,699
never heard of before you showed up at

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,829
Apache column but most importantly

00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:40,299
you're gonna make friends here and I

00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:43,029
hope you take advantage of that I think

00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:45,339
it's an incredible opportunity and to

00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:47,289
Murrell and rich and the folks that

00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:49,269
you've assembled to produce Apache con

00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:52,359
thank you I appreciate the opportunity

00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:55,289
that I get to come here and continue

00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,289
building relationships

00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,850
[Applause]

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,950
you

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,950
