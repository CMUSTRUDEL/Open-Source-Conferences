do that tomorrow I also want to point

00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:02,069
out that we have two free workshops that

00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,779
are satellite events to the to the

00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:07,090
conference one is being put on by open

00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:09,520
source design there's a total of 20 free

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,590
open slots for that I've registered so

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,020
I'll be there on Friday there's also an

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,240
Apache airflow event you can also go

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,849
there that's also free for the open

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,340
source design event you have to pay 10

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:23,530
euros to register you'll get that 10

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,390
euros back when you arrive there the

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,769
idea is to make sure that those limited

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,600
slots don't get taken by people who

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,720
aren't gonna show up

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,600
if you like to run Jean Claire is

about some of the history some of the

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,820
things you remember happening at the

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,110

are in the area you can look on the

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,030
website for those

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,310
you may have noticed if you've been

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,500
looking at our website for the program

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,880
there's been a glitch you'll see that

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,830
things are off by three and a half hours

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,590
we're working on that but in the

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,940
meantime please use the the printed

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,010
programs that are that are hanging

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,210
everywhere in the elevators and next to

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,490
the booths

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:31,290
if you're in doubt about when the the

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,180
talk that you want to go to is AD and

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,430
with that being said I'd like to

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,000
introduce our first talk our first talk

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,000
is a panel

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,400
we will be that they will be being

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,960
moderated by Sanders striker senator

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,540
striker has worked as a product manager

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,690
at Bloomberg and has served in senior

00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,960
roles in media and technology related to

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,670
startups and at the ASF he has served in

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,990
many roles he served as a as the

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,420
president he served as the executive

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,180
vice president and he served on the

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,710
board of directors so I want you to give

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,710
a warm round of applause to sander

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:27,930
thank you all let him introduce without

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:32,430
whom we wouldn't be celebrating the 20th

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:36,330
anniversary so from foreign is a derek

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:40,160
villain phallic who leaked Lars ila

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,160
breath and mark Cox

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,030
[Applause]

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,100
I didn't even need to prompt you for

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,020
that that's great so while we've

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,670
registered it as a panel session that's

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,620
that's really just a poor excuse to have

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,180
chairs for these old guys all right

00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:01,680
they've been doing this for 20 years so

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:03,390
now they can sit down I think during the

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,010
session it would be great to just hear

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:10,250
their stories and we'll we'll start with

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,250
mark

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,720
I was I was hoping for a picture here

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:42,120
but it's not there Oh No our prop is

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:45,360
gone so it was back in 1995 that brian

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:49,170
behlendorf invited me to join the new HD

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,320
pd mailing list I've been working on

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,050
some issues security issues in the NCSA

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,910
web server and finding and fixing those

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,000
and sharing those with the NCSA folks

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,180
but also Brian who was a fellow web

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,710
administrator and and Brian said these

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,660
patches are great why don't you come in

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,600
joiners I've got a group of people

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,040
coming together to work on a web server

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,310
based on the NCSA web server

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,900
it wasn't until 1998 though that we

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,700
first all met in person

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,490
IBM kind of sponsored us to come

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,260
together in San Francisco and and the

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,380
picture would have been the picture of

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,720
our first meeting in person just before

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,840
the actual discussions in an office we

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,540
went down a cliff and took pictures at a

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,880
waterfall as developers like to do I was

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,890
really worried about that actually I was

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,660
really worried that we had all our eggs

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,330
in one basket we had nearly all the

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,540
developers of the Apache web server in

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,040
one place at one time and it's not like

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,660
something this goes known for natural

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,140
disasters right what's the worst that

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,630
could happen

00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:02,160
and I was really worried as well because

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:04,530
at that time Microsoft were a huge story

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,410
patch is a huge risk to their business

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,960
we were rapidly taking away their market

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,850
share of the web server market and

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,040
although that's not a very plausible

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,020
risk perhaps a more plausible risk was

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,550
that we'd end up at Fisherman's Wharf

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:25,680
eating the same bad sushi just the way

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,600
my brain works um now if something bad

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
had happened to us all on that on that

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,520
day the the code would have survived

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,830
right the code was on tens of

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,810
machines around the world already but

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,120
the people the people who shared the

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,760
same goals the same mission the same

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,310
vision would have gone away and what the

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,520
project still have existed and continued

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,440
had to happen probably not when I was

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,300
thinking about this talk and when I gave

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,770
the same talk at Vegas last month kind

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,350
of hit me that that is really what we

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,690
mean by community over code right it was

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,980
really important that the people were

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:10,070
there and together and the code was not

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:12,700
so personally Apache has intertwined

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,490
itself over my life in the last 24 years

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,870
started out with writing Apache week

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,450
through to working on stronghold for a

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,790
company called c2 net c2 net got bought

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,130
by Red Hat at the same time I was doing

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,700
lots of work with lawyers and that's how

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,279
I ended up meeting my wife at the first

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,720
one of the first Apache cons a group of

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
Apache developers got together and

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,740
decided to form the OpenSSL project and

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,350
whilst OpenSSL is not an Apache project

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,839
it was formed by a lot of Apache

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:44,540
developers and has recently switched to

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:50,390
the new versions being under the Apache

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:53,810
License which is great news in Vegas Jim

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:56,000
Gretzky said that he got more out of

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,410
Apache than he could ever repay and I

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,230
think there's a sentiment a lot of us

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,850
here have as well and it's true for

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,750
everyone I think who uses any Apache

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,180
project that you get more out than you

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,800
can put in and I certainly personally

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,560
see that as well it's a mixed blessing

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,720
knowing security it's not a job that

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,820
many people really want to do when I

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,399
joined Red Hat the first thing the the

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,950
new VP of engineering did was call me up

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,820
and said mark you know security we don't

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:31,399
have a security team you're it and that

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,130
was the next 18 years of my life dealing

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,070
with Red Hat security issues until I

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,300
kind of couldn't do that anymore I was

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,850
in a great position though

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,380
Red Hat now pay for my time to work on

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,009
open source projects

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:49,240
Pachi and open ssl and dealing with

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:49,240
security issues of course

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:55,850
so I'm now a VP of security for patchy

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,709
we've got Apache committee as a

00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,750
committee who look after security issues

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:01,550
across all projects and help those

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,910
projects deal with them and manage them

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,790
in fact Dirk and Lars are both also on

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,279
that committee that's interesting to me

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,019
because I've not coded for a long time

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,470
yet I can still make a really valuable

00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,139
contribution to Apache I can give back

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:20,110
by being part of that committee and

00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:24,350
editing my expertise to security issues

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,810
to give you an example that the the

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,240
security committee we get 21,000 the

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,470
emails a year some of that spam of

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,589
course some of that's people who are

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,870
confused by the Apache License so it

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:39,110
generally ends up about 400 a year of

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,480
actual reported issues those get handed

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,819
out to the projects to look after and to

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,860
deal with some of those obviously real

00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:50,300
issues and some and not and so we end up

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:53,870
with about 150 CVS which are fixed and

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:57,709
published security issues a year that's

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,899
across about 85 projects so that's

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:03,160
that's my involvement to date and I

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,310
think that's now on to Lars or sander

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,180
Lars

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:11,080
thank you thank you

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:14,620
[Applause]

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,720
yes oh he mark mentioned that waterfall

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,600
picture which was supposed to be on on

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,790
there but yeah unfortunately something

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,490
went wrong and but that initial meeting

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,200
that that mark mentioned unfortunately I

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,290
missed that I was yea late to the party

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:35,350
so to speak because I only joined the

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:37,870
Apache group about a month later I was

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,630
actually a student at that time and a

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,570
German publishing company had a

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,890
previously approached me and asked would

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,690
you like to write a book about the

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,970
Apache web server because I started

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,270
getting into this area of web

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,460
technologies and obviously in 1998 it

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,460
was the Apache web because that was the

00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,700
most popular web server software that

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:03,930
was available um so I started writing

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,280
the book and went into a lot of bugs

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,500
bugs in the code parks in the

00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,480
documentation in some cases it wasn't

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,180
even clear to me is the documentation

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,760
wrong or is the code wrong so I started

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:21,400
submitting a lot of bug reports to the

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,170
Apache group and in some cases they they

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,780
responded or fixed the issue in some

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,090
cases I didn't really see things being

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,470
turned about quickly enough so

00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,500
eventually I started submitting patches

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,390
as well tomorrow on bug reports because

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,980
well I needed to finish writing that

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,560
book and I needed I didn't want to

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,100
document the the faulty behavior or what

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,080
I thought was faulty behavior so yeah

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,080
eventually I got invited and I was very

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,240
very honored to be to be invited but

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,290
also a little bit surprised because I

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:56,050
thought well I've contributed yeah but

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,950
it's just some small patches here and

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:02,740
there it didn't seem to me as like major

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,270
contributions that would make them

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,140
invite me to become a member of the

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:11,760
Apache group and I remember mentioning

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,020
this in an email and I remember the

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,320
response from Ben lorry who

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:20,770
unfortunately cannot be here today he

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,749
responded saying like if Apache would

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,829
measure

00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:28,959
people's value based on their

00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:31,899
contributed lines of code the apache

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,370
group would be poorer for it and I think

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,279
that that's stuck with me and I think

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,829
it's still a very valid statement or

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:42,550
very valid thing for the ASF in general

00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:46,660
today it's not just about code

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:51,209
contributions contributions come in all

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:54,329
forms and sizes for example we have

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:59,499
several or many foundation members

00:14:54,329 --> 00:15:03,220
who've never coded a single line who

00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:05,199
have not contributed any code and they

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,620
have made valuable and very important

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,449
contributions to the ASF an important

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,300
example is that I would like to mention

00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:16,809
there is Sally canary she looks after

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,240
public relations at the ASF still today

00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:21,639
and she's done that and helped us with

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,449
this whole topic of publicly public

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:29,050
relations defining our our brand and

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:30,579
defining what the ASF actually is and

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,879
probably even helped define what

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:35,470
open-source actually is from a public

00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,139
relations point of view and she's done

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,399
that from a very early stage in the life

00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,399
of the Apache Software Foundation

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,779
personally in addition to code

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,480
contributions I've spent a lot of time

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:57,009
with conference planning basically when

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,410
we created the foundation in 1999 we had

00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:01,929
three top level projects obviously the

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,629
Apache web server we had the chocolate

00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,999
uh project which was intended to or

00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:10,779
actually helped us to develop various

00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:13,149
java application solutions for example

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,069
tomcat and we had a third project which

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:19,360
was the conferences or conference

00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:21,550
planning project and i kind of jumped at

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,829
the opportunity to to help with that

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:28,629
because thought is a is a very very big

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:32,610
opportunity to to help grow our

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:35,040
community of developers and end users

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,290
will already mentioned this in the

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,380
we've we've done this fall for more than

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,460
20 years now and and developed many many

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:47,940
Apache conferences roadshows hackathon

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,280
events barcamps is set and I think it's

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,800
one of the reasons why the Apache had

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:58,890
but the Apache Software Foundation has

00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,510
grown into what it is today I remember

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:04,890
when I went to the very very first

00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:07,920
Apache Con in 1998 that was shortly I

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,350
was I became a member of the Apache of

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,930
the Apache group and it wasn't amazing

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,940
experience for me I met all these other

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,640
developers for the for the first time

00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,709
and it really motivated me to continue

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,000
contributing because I wanted to

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,410
continue working with these guys and I

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,959
think it's it's important to continue

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,480
doing that yes at the Apache Software

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,880
Foundation everything happens on mailing

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,430
lists and all that but I think we need

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,090
that face-to-face time every now and

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,200
then to help grow the community and

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,620
looking at the audience now I'm pretty

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,360
sure there's some future committers and

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,100
foundation members sitting already in

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,300
this audience who just haven't made that

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:54,030
first small step in contributing and it

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,120
doesn't necessarily have to be code what

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,460
matters more is is the people it's the

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,810
community over code thing that that

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,850
often gets mentioned as part of the

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:11,580
Apache Software Foundation I think

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:14,430
that's very important yeah thanks Lars

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:19,020
that's that's definitely a key part that

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:21,570
we we want to keep emphasizing so many

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:28,110
great stories here Dirk do you want to

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:28,800
go into like why the foundation to do

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,230
some of that

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,490
I mean basically for that why kind of

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,500
like I have to sort of like go back so

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,870
like to - to northern Italy so back to

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,000
the Alps to lager majora absolutely

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,860
splendid environment where at the time I

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,960
was sitting in a very small office of

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,810
the European Commission basically being

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,870
what was will become a webmaster and so

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,370
like trying to solve like curate data

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,620
the idea in this particular case - so

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:56,220
like make that available over the the

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,840
first start of the internet and in many

00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,490
ways like it was a fairly low resource

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,170
like tasks but then sub like I found

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,360
this this online community of other

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,130
webmasters people who sort of like just

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,450
hats off like much the same challenges

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,460
who are trying to keep their web servers

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,470
alive who talk like to add security who

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,210
needs to add in my case things like the

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,800
is map thing so you can so like could

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,850
sort of draw areas on maps and things

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,050
like that and so like so the environment

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,780
where you could solve like collaborate

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:24,210
with with other people around that same

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,620
codebase around that same goal which was

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,780
so like helping you and so plug your

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,460
day-to-day thing to do in my case of

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,920
like maintaining a website with with

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,110
satellite images despite the fact that

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,220
perhaps some of us sort of like we're

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,050
working for companies which are

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,640
effectively their competitors so you saw

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,110
I could select separate what you were so

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,580
glad doing and delivering so flag from

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,760
the tools and the means you you are

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,900
using for that and and all of that was

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,250
actually going actually really rather

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,010
well so flack from the so of like

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,300
mid-90s onwards until so like did the

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,520
end of the century when when all of a

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,110
sudden a whole pile of things started to

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,610
happen at the same time and and

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,809
certainly for me personally so like took

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,360
me off guard that was almost like a

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,490
feeling of panic because you had soaked

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,650
like Elizabeth Frank and and Rob McCool

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,540
and and and Mark Anderson on the browser

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,940
side who suddenly thought like left the

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,410
DL DN C use a your National Center for

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,630
supercomputing applications or being a

00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,390
container university to form what would

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,679
later become Netscape and we were

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,570
working on their codebase we were so

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,250
like maintaining that that NC is a web

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,330
service all of a sudden look like hours

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,040
of like leading lights especially

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,900
Elizabeth Franks of like they were so

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,540
like gone and what would happen to that

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,370
code at the same time apart she became

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,900
more and more popular so like more and

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,910
more people started to collaborate and

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,510
use that code base of our so so like we

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:38,070
became a very soft like visible almost

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,780
like dominant if you want so like having

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,730
a market share of 80 percent 90 percent

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,740
these sort of numbers of all those web

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,150
service we took like of course attracted

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,890
a lot of aggression in the market

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,720
because we tend to saw like think that

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,160
that big tech today is so like overly

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,870
powerful well I can tell you Soph like

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,100
in the 90s there was I was totally

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,720
different set of big tech but are also

00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,760
like very very very powerful and then

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,980
very very aggressive so that's what like

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,660
felt scary also because in that time so

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,370
like lawsuits against individuals and

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,919
companies being aggressively bought

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:09,210
things we're not exactly unheard of but

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,679
all the things were also happening so

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,390
flag that cholerae she was really going

00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,220
well and some companies are like

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,919
realizing an IBM was off like one of the

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,650
first that actually their team of a few

00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,159
hundred full-time IBM developers

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,409
couldn't out-innovate this a batch group

00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,880
of people this ragtag of group of

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,100
volunteers were so like collaborating

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,650
around that codebase IBM so that

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,510
couldn't keep up innovation wise so

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,490
basically with an IBM that was his plan

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,529
formed like well Exley we'd like to

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,059
solve like basically join that group so

00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,610
like random come to your own lotus

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:44,279
domino domino a webserver who we so like

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:47,279
like to use the Apache Apache the server

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,020
as our code base but then of course so

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,820
flag DT so like grown up stepped in the

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,260
lawyers went like okay so you want to

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,600
actually do this thing but but who are

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,070
those Apache people who are they what

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,140
are they I mean do they actually even

00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,549
exist and of course we didn't exist were

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,870
just like a meaningless and and this

00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:02,100
wasn't help that at that time there were

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,630
solve like articles in the New York

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,860
Times saying that so like all just met

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,840
on the Internet where the you were talk

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,130
and and and so like the lawyers had

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,390
clearly read that one and there was

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,399
another one so like in I think the

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,990
Economist where one of one of our realms

00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,580
of like explained how great it was to

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,110
work an open-source in a party because

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,760
you could do it so of like in the middle

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,279
of the night put naked drinking gin and

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,890
tonic so that wasn't quite the right

00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,149
sort of like thing so sodium laureth

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,429
went like yeah well this this is not

00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:28,799
owned but in their wisdoms of like day

00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,320
tens of like still came to us and

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,690
actually gave us hope like a very large

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,549
gift they essentially the use of a

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,190
teleconference line so basically it made

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,500
it possible for us to actually talk over

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,850
the phone so plug directly to it because

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,409
keep in mind for that time even though

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,909
we been already around for quite a while

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:46,409
we'd never met in person we can never

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,440
solve like phoned each other we have no

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:51,270
idea what we looked like and at that

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,620
time so like a teleconference now is

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,970
easy but back then soap like you would

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,799
easily soak like pay a couple of

00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,659
thousand dollars for just so like an

00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,010
hour international telephone conference

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,230
at that scale so that was actually a

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,730
rather large gift so it actually led us

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,279
off like for the very first time so like

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,659
to talk about those things and then so

00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,279
like ultimately I guess was was

00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,679
described before we saw like ended up so

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,510
XD in in San Francisco to XE for the

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,660
first time meet face to face and so plug

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,070
discuss how what we saw back actually

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,560
for my foundation shoot we form a

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,820
foundation should be sort of like

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,140
formalize ourselves little bit and and

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,640
of course the answer so flag was already

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,770
a little bit so clock in that previous

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,330
story and yet was yes because actually

00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,870
that aggression was was actually serious

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,700
concern the market here was very serious

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,110
I mean basically it was clear that this

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,060
was no longer something which could be

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,770
done purely by by a group of volunteers

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,210
which which which of like barely had had

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:43,740
ever met and now at that same so flight

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,110
time and it's a question of like I quite

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,550
quite I get quite often so like why how

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,050
whenever that you end up as a Delaware

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,510
incorporate why did soap like this this

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,130
foundation end up in the US what they

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,540
don't even have the legal concept of a

00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,830
foundation because I parties actually

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,650
and incorporated we're actually like a

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,120
basically a normal company and at the

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,650
ends of like dates at that time as well

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,200
because we serve like looked at that

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,880
back then and yes I mean there were many

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,070
sort of considerations about soap like

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,330
hosting the code and managing the code

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,010
in Europe because actually Europe has

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,510
got very good foundation protections in

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,860
the in the law for for for long term

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,040
foundation which one to maintain an

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,210
asset like code but on the other side we

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,620
already saw like what people were

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,600
worried about aggression and of course

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,040
that aggression probably come from the

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,350
u.s. from the big tech companies of that

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,480
time in the US and actually it was so

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,310
black felt to protect people better so

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,800
glad the US was like a much better place

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:34,050
and Delaware so black was interesting

00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,460
because it was one of the few states

00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,100
where you could solve like quite easily

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,870
have in corporations without actually

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,430
physically going there all too often do

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,170
some of your board meetings by phone or

00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,240
by email so actually they stopped like

00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,770
allowed a little bit more innovation in

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,300
so black how you set up your your

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,200
organization how you had your board

00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,090
meetings how you had you and your

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,920
meetings and things like that so that

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,390
was what we talked like why we we ended

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,990
up so up like as a as a Delaware

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,330
incorporated with of course on the side

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,350
the little issue that that

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,780
cryptography at that time was still so

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,840
like not something you could very solve

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,390
like easily export or otherwise move

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,190
around so kind of like that sounds like

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,900
also like basically we thought like and

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,070
suddenly became an incorporated that was

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,710
a massive amount of work because

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,810
actually we'd sub like we'd kept a very

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,130
nice CVS record of all our code but we

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,419
actually never gone through it and

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,980
actually figured out what came from whom

00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,809
and how so XD that was actually a

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,759
process we did we soaked like white

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,109
washed our code we serve like made sure

00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,669
that we knew from every line are there

00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,200
from who it was and that it's person has

00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:34,149
agreed to select donate to the apache

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,679
software for this to the legal entity or

00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,059
we so like removed it or it was

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
basically part of what was called a

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:44,139
block grant because it was off like

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:45,999
donated by and that's all like the

00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:47,379
principle we saw still have today so

00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:48,970
like that whenever so like the ASF

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,590
touches a piece of code we saw black try

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,139
to make it absolutely clean so that the

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,639
community can solve like unencumbered so

00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:58,899
of like maintain it for the time being

00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:00,369
for me so like i was so busy at the time

00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,779
so like still so like most he's like

00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:05,080
sitting there in italy in the alps sort

00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:07,779
of like working on my stuff and this was

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,309
all yeah i think it it made me so like

00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,840
feel a little bit easier about things it

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,529
also make me feel like actually if if i

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,789
drop out

00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:14,499
there's a whole community in this code

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:15,850
will live on and actually we can

00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,649
continue to serve these satellite

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,029
pictures for for many years to come to

00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,950
do weather forecasts or whatever else

00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,989
and and that's all like felt good but it

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,600
wasn't really resonating that actually

00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:28,629
for me personally changed abouts of like

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,909
the turn on in the year 2000 when there

00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,859
was a series of conferences in the the

00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,690
miskova the big conference center in

00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:36,730
Silicon Valley in San Francisco and

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,169
there are by pure quinces they were so

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,960
like back-to-back one after the other

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:42,489
and and by Morris by a constant basis of

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,590
like I was I was having to give a short

00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:47,799
talk or presentation at each of those

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,369
and at the first one basically I was

00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,989
there on stage

00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:51,460
I can't remember what CERN or Oracle or

00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:54,519
TEPCO but it was one of the big guys at

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,659
that time and basically the audience was

00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,730
like some two people the audience were

00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:00,669
like tearing into me and telling me that

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,320
I was evil and that I was clearly in the

00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:04,119
pocket of that other tech company the

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,739
other competing company and and that we

00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,080
were completely biased and that were

00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:10,779
we're only helping help in competition

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,950
and that was kind of like a little bit

00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,210
of a shock that first meeting also

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,799
because I knew that that in that

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,899
organization I think it was so next

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,279
thing lots of people actually we're very

00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:19,960
supportive a patch there were lots of

00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,399
developers within within soon which were

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,840
actually working on Apache called

00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:24,970
helping to get Jakarta going

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,460
helping to get cocoon and Tomcat in the

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,529
XML parsers coax one cuz where is this

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,210
aggression coming from but then the week

00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,309
after I was at the competitors

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,720
conference and exactly the same thing

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,190
happens I was taught like being accused

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,470
of people a pocket of leo

00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,760
your Luck's oracles I think was

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,320
was this thing actually which actually

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,920
ended up on the front page of the local

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,090
newspaper and that was more like it

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,110
interesting and then the third

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,190
conference the week after happened

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,660
exactly the same thing happened again

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,640
and that's all like the third time from

00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,260
me drove home that wait a second I've

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,730
now been accused of being in everyone's

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,070
pocket by everyone else so basically

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,960
it's completely cross relation so that

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,670
made me feel that actually this is a

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,220
purchasing it may have something going

00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:05,950
is that that license it really just

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,750
seemed to relax people collaborate

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,940
across company boundaries of cross

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,650
country boundaries and sort of like

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,330
create a safe and fair playing field

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,340
where you can solve a collectively work

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,170
on code even though there's lots of

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,000
aggression and lots of competition and

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,410
lots of things happening outside you you

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,690
can actually sort like make this code

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,870
live there so like make this code so of

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,520
like survive people survive companies

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,870
coming and going I mean if you solve

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,460
like look at the people we were really

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,810
really worried about back so plug back

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,310
in the so like turn of the centuries

00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,380
most of those companies don't no longer

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,790
exists in the view which still exists

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,620
are kind of like either marginalized or

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,910
our best friends today and some of the

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,410
company which were solved like really

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,610
pro open-source right now we're actually

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,440
worrying a mountain right now so

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,040
actually Apache so black has given me so

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,060
flex on some peace of mind that actually

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,980
detects it doesn't really matter we can

00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,300
solve like manage and so like maintain

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,430
things we can solve like have that

00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,900
community live on and on and on even its

00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,540
off like the players change the code

00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,280
chains and things like that so that's

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,110
off like is is is I think so blog my

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,240
closing thought there that that's what

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,950
like that license we have which is like

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,810
let's look like let's you talk like

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,300
separate things and so like let a

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,130
community told her to survive and handle

00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,900
that code so like in in a safe way I

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,400
think that's one of the most valuable

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,370
things I think for for me personally so

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,810
of like a purchase has has brought me

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:23,440
thanks

00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,440
[Applause]

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,990
make sure that it's really wonderful I'm

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,640
sure that a lot of people that are in

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,190
the audience what are they for being

00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,529
around for a long time or not have not

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,330
heard all of this before so that's

00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:39,720
that's really great and I'm hopeful that

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:42,000
we get to share more stories um if you

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,090
want to talk to any one of the founders

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,260
later on on their badges they have this

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:52,590
is bright like fluorescent thing that

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,029
says plenty plus so if you can't

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,929
remember their faces which I'm sure you

00:29:54,029 --> 00:30:00,539
will

00:29:54,929 --> 00:30:02,730
you can recognize in my lineup I think

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:05,580
all of us together just shows how how

00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:09,990
strong the foundations of the foundation

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,730
are by Barry here 20 years later which

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:15,000
is great so I'd like to have another

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,330
round for for the founders that made

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,820
this possible

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,820
[Applause]

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,950
and was that I'm gonna thank you and

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,190
you'll have a great conference following

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:35,249
this thank you

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,249
