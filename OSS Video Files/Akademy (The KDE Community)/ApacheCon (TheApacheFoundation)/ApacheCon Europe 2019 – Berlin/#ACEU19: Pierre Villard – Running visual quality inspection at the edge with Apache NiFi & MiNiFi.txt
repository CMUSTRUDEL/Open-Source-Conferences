Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. Apache NiFi supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. MiNiFi — a subproject of Apache NiFi — is a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of NiFi in data flow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation.

In this talk I present how Apache NiFi & MiNiFi can be used in combination with Google Cloud AutoML Vision to implement a visual quality inspection system. The idea is to demonstrate the possibilities to interact with edge devices while leveraging cloud services in a real world use case
