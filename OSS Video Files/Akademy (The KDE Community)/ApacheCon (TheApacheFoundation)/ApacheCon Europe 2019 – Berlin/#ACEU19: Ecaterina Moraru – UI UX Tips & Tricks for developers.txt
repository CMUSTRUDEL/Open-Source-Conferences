UI/UX is a craft. The more you practice it, the better you are at it. Some people argue that you need to have 'good taste' in order to be a designer, to be the 'artsy type'. While this might be true for Graphic Design, Branding and Visual Arts in general, when it comes to Interface, Interaction and Product Design, the focus is more on practicality and 'common sense'.

I will present some general UI/UX tips & tricks that will help you design better. Everyone should know the basic principles and patterns of design, and once you understand them you will naturally integrate them in your work.

so my name is Ekaterina Marrero and you

00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:13,300
can find me on Twitter at valleca and

00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:15,880
today I want to talk about basic

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,680
principles and tips and tricks that all

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,829
of the variables from no and they should

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,980
be able to apply them in their open

00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:25,750
source project in the user experience

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,579
feel that there are a lot of patterns

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,290
and I won't go into patterns but I

00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,450
provided here some links for patterns

00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,660
and principles if you want to explore

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,990
and go find out more what I will cover

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,390
our basic principles and one principle

00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,850
means having a fundamental rule about

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:46,510
the practice of design and if you were

00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:49,630
to know just one principle that would be

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,280
be consistent in your interface having a

00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,550
consistent interface helps your user

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,460
learn one thing once and then apply that

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,500
knowledge to other areas of your

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,190
interface and what means to be

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,950
consistent it means to have similar

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:10,720
functions in meaning for similar objects

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,940
but being consistent it doesn't mean

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,010
that all the buttons needs to be the

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,640
same there are several types of buttons

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:22,630
and your forms and your interface should

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,299
always state what is the primary action

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,250
of that form and primary action are

00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,680
usually made with more contrast and

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,850
colors in order to direct the the user

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,770
on what you want him to focus on have

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,640
only one primary action on the screen

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:43,240
and it is better to always use verbs as

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:47,560
actions in the label name so try to

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,380
avoid confusing phrases or generic words

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,060
like okay and yes and instead use verbs

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,439
because users are thinking verbs they

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,290
want to delete something they want to

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,290
add an object or they want to save it

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,960
and another thing and a big debate in

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,210
between the designer is where should we

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,310
place the buttons on a bot on a model

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,650
should they be placed on the left side

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,540
and on the right side and while some

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,790
designers might tell you that it's a

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,919
matter of the operating systems and the

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,490
style guides for that operating systems

00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,500
I

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,990
just want to show you some things to

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,590
consider when you decide where to place

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:29,350
them for example left-aligned is very

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,660
good for vertical scanning the user just

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,880
needs to read the title and then go to

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,580
the button so he will know what to do

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,640
but the issue is when the user needs to

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,290
read actually the the description text

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,470
in thing to read the description text

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,890
then the reading flow changes to what

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,350
was the shape and the problem with the Z

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,020
shape on the vertical alignment is that

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,300
they will first read the the primary

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,980
button they go to the secondary action

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,140
and they they will need to go back

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,360
because that's the action you want

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,030
actually the user to take so it's a bit

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,080
slower than then on the right on the

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,030
right alignment but another thing you

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,370
need to consider is are you designing

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,490
for mobile or are you designing for for

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,220
desktops because on the mobile the

00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,690
distance is not that big so either on

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,530
the left side or on the right side it

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,140
would be good some software actually put

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,870
them centered and the buttons all are

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,060
all the full width but on very large

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,000
displays and now we actually have like

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,250
4k and 8k is this place if you place

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,600
them on the right side and you don't

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,720
have columns for example you might

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,240
create a discontinuing the text in the

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,900
button so maybe left align would be

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:51,580
better in certain cases here I just

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,710
display that on the right align you make

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:58,140
like the nail shape so it's harder for

00:03:53,710 --> 00:04:01,480
the user to reach those buttons it also

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,880
depends if your what types of buttons

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,160
you have in your interface a common

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,500
pattern is to have wizards and wizards

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,560
have like an extended preview and for

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,590
Western culture when we read the book we

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,350
are kind of going from left to right so

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,959
it's a more natural placement for the

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:25,180
next button to be on them on the right

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,970
side but no matter if you're choosing

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,740
left or right make sure that the primary

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,990
button it's a line on the edge because

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,750
edges are more accessible and

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:40,360
and the virtual scan the vertical

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,920
scanning okay Lu also mention colors

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,530
colors are important to be accessible

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,750
but again depending on the cultures

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,240
colors can have meanings in Western

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,810
cultures red is used for errors and for

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:57,010
the interaction while green it's used

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,830
for versus success states be very

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,930
careful that in Asia the meanings are

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,580
reversed so know your audience and know

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,350
from what argot you need to design but

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,050
this doesn't mean if you know what color

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,180
we can put on a on a notification or a

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:17,020
button then we should use all the colors

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,360
and have also yellow and other kinds of

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:23,500
blue try to limit your color selection

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,840
to maybe have a primary secondary even

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,690
tertiary actions are debatable some are

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,120
using them only for to showcase the

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:36,550
Kansas State but having a danger button

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,490
and a color for destructive actions is

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,590
important because if everyone in the

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,450
interface you are consistent when the

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,610
user will see the red button he will

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,090
know that that action is important so

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,990
for destructive actions use a contrast

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,090
and color always ask for confirmation

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,710
explain very well the consequences and I

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,810
know it may be a bit harder on the

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,140
implementation side to provide support

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,950
for undo or for version control but it

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:08,080
will help the user to be able to fix

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:15,210
their mistake in case they they miss

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:17,530
click on that destructive action ok

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,960
another big principle it's called the

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,000
Fordyce people might not know exactly

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,100
what it means but a common metaphor to

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,840
try to explain affordance are dwars so

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,230
when you see a door and it has like a

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,140
circular a knob the user my understand

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,790
that he needs to turn that that now been

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,060
ordered to open the door

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,690
same if you want to let the user know

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,349
that a doors open in a certain direction

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,050
you could put like a

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:51,259
poor a pool knob in order for them to

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:55,009
pull and a flat handle for them to push

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:57,139
so affordance actually means giving cues

00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:01,039
on how the user may interact with that

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:03,259
object without for them interacted with

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,469
with with it in that place they have

00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:09,199
some previous knowledge or the

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:12,439
attributes of that object gives him a

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,229
clue what to do with the object and this

00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,349
principle can be applied also for links

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:21,110
so traditionally links have been

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:24,770
represented by using the blue colors and

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:29,439
underlined in the past year because of a

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:32,959
lot of designers this this trend has

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,459
let's say decrease but still if a user

00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,319
sees something that is blue and

00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:37,999
underlined if it has previous web

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,009
experience you might know that that is

00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,979
the link so be careful when you're using

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:46,520
the blue color for things that are not

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:48,529
linked and the same it's also for

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,930
battles because buttons have a click

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:53,360
State traditionally they were

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,779
represented using 3d objects and they

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,120
had like like like lots of shadows and

00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,949
gradients now with the flat trends this

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,889
is less but if you would provide this

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:05,360
kind of cues in your interface the

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,069
interface would be more accessible and

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,769
more visibility will increase because

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:14,209
the other user wouldn't know how they

00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:16,639
can interact with it one discussion is

00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:20,300
when to you do we use buttons and when

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,369
do we use links and if it's much

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,769
straightforward that we should not use

00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:27,229
buttons inside of the text because there

00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:30,259
might be some line high discrepancy or

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:33,169
or alignment the solution for this issue

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,870
is not to use links everywhere buttons

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,930
and links have been created for a very

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:42,380
particular purpose so you should use

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,329
buttons if you need it for actions if

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,370
something intervene the interface change

00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,050
the state of the interface by adding

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,660
something or by deleting something and

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,269
links should be used for navigation

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:58,310
somewhere that you take the user in

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,130
another section okay so I know there was

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,380
a big talk

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,600
about battles but buttons and firms in

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,290
general are are very predominant

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,510
prominent in our interfaces I also want

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,760
us to go in some grouping principle and

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,830
one of the basic principle is proximity

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,750
which states that objects that are close

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,510
together are perceived to be related and

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,730
this principle can be easily applied in

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,820
when you're doing menu design instead of

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,940
having five separate groups just by

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,940
reducing the the white space between the

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,530
items now you have fewer groups you have

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,260
just three you have also here an example

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:44,160
on how it was used to be done on the

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:47,040
Gmail by placing related items together

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,750
one notice make sure that the items are

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,780
actually related somehow

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,590
and not just play with them because it

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,750
will be better visually another

00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,970
principle its similarity which states

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,950
that objects sharing attributes are

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,160
perceived to be related and you can play

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,380
here with with color with size shapes or

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,380
orientation so if you look at it picture

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:13,020
and your brain is trying to read it by

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,510
lines it would be much harder for for

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,030
your brain because it's natural to go by

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:22,230
columns because of the similarity they

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:24,480
go and if similarity in proximity are

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,420
very very powerful there is an even more

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,300
powerful law which is called law of

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,970
unity which overrides cues from

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,880
proximity and similarity and what it

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,190
actually does is that if we connect

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,070
things by lines and by borders they

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:45,900
automatically are perceived as part of

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:48,000
the same group be very careful with this

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,540
because you might be tempted to have

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,820
lines and borders everywhere the more if

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,250
you add more lines the interface would

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:01,410
look more crowded so try to limit and in

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:03,630
the past period we actually seen going

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,940
back to proximity by trying to increase

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,630
the the white space and by removing

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,830
lines so and falling back again on the

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,930
proximity principle instead of this

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:17,640
principle in order when you create

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,740
or interfaces and here is an example of

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,760
how you could use lines and borders in

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:28,890
order to to group form elements you know

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:32,700
in a screen okay choice paralysis states

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:34,740
that user might have paralysis when they

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,660
see a lot of items that are very similar

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,820
and he doesn't know how to compare them

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,950
and another rule it's the Hicks law

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,300
which says that the time to make the

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,770
decision increases with the number and

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,980
complexity of choices this principle can

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,960
be applied on I don't know options when

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,850
you want to buy something or to select

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,610
something were to download or on menus

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,830
it you can apply it everywhere make sure

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:03,900
that you clearly differentiate the

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:06,390
differences between the items keep as

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,540
few as you can even to it would be ideal

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,970
and if you can also recommend one of the

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,770
of the entries it would help the user to

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,620
make the decision faster and not feel

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:22,410
frustrated of not knowing go what I can

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:26,190
choose Miller in the some sent a century

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,500
ago he made some Studies on the shrimp

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,860
in memory of people people were given a

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,950
lot of words and he was quantifying how

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:39,540
many of those words people can remember

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:42,690
and the conclusion then was like seven

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,209
plus minus two items and for a very long

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:49,830
time this argument was given in order to

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:52,500
limit the entries in the menu currently

00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,029
these days there are new estimates of

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,670
four plus minus one anyone this is

00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:58,860
debatable so I don't have a magic number

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,490
to give you how many items a menu should

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,070
have but the conclusion is try to limit

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,839
the the entries in order to be easier

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,360
for them to remember to not need to go

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,690
over again and to know exactly where

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,640
they are in the interface a related

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:20,760
principle is the serial position effect

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:26,220
in a serial position we remember better

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:29,310
the the the first and the last item in

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,840
in a sequence so you can if you want to

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,300
remember this just think of the alphabet

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,310
you always know how it starts and how it

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,540
ends but in the middle you might get

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:43,410
confusing some parts and you can apply

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,840
this together with chunking which says

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,000
that if you have a large a large bunch

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,160
of items you can make them more

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,640
approachable if you split them in

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,650
smaller groups so instead of having

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,680
eight items if you break them in three

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:03,810
you are starting to have a first and

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:09,030
last item for all these items and item

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:12,540
groups some I say that and actually it's

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,520
true to put the most important things on

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,220
the first and the second position but

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,480
also don't forget about the last if it's

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,580
less it doesn't mean it's not that

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,820
important it might be actually very

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,820
visible in menus and again in navigation

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:34,530
chunking can be also used for for forums

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,800
so if you have a card number or a phone

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:41,610
number people usually remember phone

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,510
numbers by having this splitted in two

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,520
or three digit sequences and if the

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,410
interface you are creating its mapping

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,970
to to what they are used to it would be

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,990
much easier for them to know exactly

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:58,410
what you want from them try to place the

00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,060
labels on top again for vertical

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,720
scanning it would be much easier for

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,670
them to go over the form highlight and

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,520
explain the error in the context don't

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,380
just have a general place where you put

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,130
all the errors instead help the user to

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:18,030
know exactly where he he made a mistake

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:19,770
and size field feels accordingly so I

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,290
have here an example with the zip code

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:24,990
but the most classical example it's on

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,300
the credit cards we have the CVS number

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,089
at the back so if a user is going to see

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,610
an input that has three digit he will

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,650
automatically know that he after some

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:39,430
steps that he needs to put that number

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:42,550
there having white background

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:46,130
forms having the white team put on

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:50,420
background the triggers something in the

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:52,820
user that they want to fill it so this

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:56,540
will increase the completion for any of

00:15:52,820 --> 00:16:02,360
your forms even for things that are not

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:05,180
the mandatory and it's very important

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,620
that when you are aligning numbers you

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,510
do a right alignment I've seen very

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,940
often things that are left aligned or or

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,370
centered if you write right alignment

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,050
then the ditch Mo's will be on the

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,200
decimals the hundreds will be on the

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,730
hundreds and you will be very it would

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,970
be much easier for you to compare them

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,830
and this is not in activity streams but

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:33,050
especially in tables which table should

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:35,930
contain numeric values and is not

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,240
limiting to two numbers and currencies

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:41,360
but also two dates so if you apply the

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:47,600
same date format right align it in order

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:50,839
to be easy to scan it icons are very

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,900
powerful in in the interface but you

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,420
remember that icons are not Universal

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,730
the icons you see on the screen might be

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,800
interpreted by some as being a search

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,480
icon others might think it's a zoom and

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,170
that theirs might think it's just a

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,760
ping-pong paddle so every time you have

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:14,740
an icon also put the label either next

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:18,410
to it or as a tooltip on top of it a

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,880
user when he sees the your interface for

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,800
the first time he will not know what the

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,890
tightness means but it will be very

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:28,520
helpful in subsequent subsequent

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,650
releases because he will just be able to

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,940
jump to the section he wants and this is

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:40,700
why icons are very powerful in this

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:44,540
regard careful again with with the

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,460
colors and because of accessibility make

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,550
sure that the icons are big enough and

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,950
are clear and

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,860
if you have a color maybe add some

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,450
texture in order for people to

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,640
differentiate between the the icons in

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,760
the States

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,060
so I've went just for in a very few

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,520
basic things but I can recommend two

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,270
books if you want to find about more

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,010
principle and more tips and tricks and

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,620
my hope is that you learn something and

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,650
you can apply it in your open source

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,870
project of your choice so you can find

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,840
me no value and if you have any

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:39,430
questions you can ask me now or know on

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:40,900
Twitter um that was brilliant

00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,790
I'm just wondering if you could

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,740
recommend to people in the room any good

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,780
resources that summarize those design

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,150
principles you've been talking about in

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,800
case they want to go check them so this

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,730
is a collection from work called books

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,310
you can use my slides there is the book

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,620
about the principle and but it's all

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,500
over because DivX field it's kind of a

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:06,420
collection of things and it has things

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,250
from graphic design to psychology yeah

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,800
there's not a but we don't have a Bible

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,330
it would be very nice if we can compile

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,300
one yeah I think we also have some

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:23,520
resources a section on open source

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:26,230
design from some icons and some some

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:37,150
tutorials but we couldn't work more on

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:39,990
that another question okay if not thank

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,990
you so much for coming

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,410
