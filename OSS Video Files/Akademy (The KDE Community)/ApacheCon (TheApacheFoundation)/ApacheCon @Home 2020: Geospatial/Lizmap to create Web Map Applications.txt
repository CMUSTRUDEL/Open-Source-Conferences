Lizmap is an open-source application to create web map application, based on a QGIS plugin and a Web Client. The project started in 2011 and the 3rd version has been published in 2016. In 2019, the project has to be adapted to QGIS 3. We will present the state of the project, the connected projects as mapbuilder module and extension scripts, and what is coming in the future.
