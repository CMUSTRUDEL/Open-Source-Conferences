AHTSE is a collection of Open Source Apache httpd modules that can be used independently or combined to implement high performance and scalable tile services. Developed for geospatial applications, AHTSE can be used for other domains that need fast pan and zoom access to large datasets. AHTSE source code is available on GitHub, licensed under Apache License 2.0 terms. Geospatial web services compatible with the OGC WMTS, Esri REST and tiled WMS can be implemented. The tight integration with httpd results in exceptional scalability and reliability. The AHTSE development represents an evolution of the NASA original OnEarth server code. Examples of public services that use AHTSE are NASA's WorldView server (https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/), Esri's Astro server (https://astro.arcgis.com) and Esri's EarthLive server (https://earthlive.maptiles.arcgis.com) This session will describe the core AHTSE concepts, demonstrate some of the existing server instances and provide sample server configurations.

Dr. Plesea worked at NASA's JPL, where he was a pioneer in developing geospatial imagery using supercomputers and later transitioned to building geospatial web services. He built and maintained multiple generations of the well known JPL Onearth/OnMars/OnMoon geospatial image servers, and was involved in the early development of the NASA WorldWind system. Once the OnEarth server technology was adopted and transitioned to the NASA EOSDIS as the core server technology behind the WorldView client, Dr. Plesea transitioned to Esri, where his responsibilities include developing cloud architecture for the basemap geospatial services and develop cloud raster technologies. Dr. Plesea is also an active GDAL contributor and maintainer, and is the principal OnEarth and AHTSE developer.
