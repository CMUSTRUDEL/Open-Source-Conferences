Lambda is widely used in the industry when people need to process both real-time and historical data to get a result. It is effective, and a good balance of speed and reliability. But there are still challenges to use Lambda in the practice. The biggest detraction has been the need to maintain two distinct (and possibly complex) systems to generate both batch and streaming layers. Thus, the operational cost of maintaining multiple clusters is nontrivial, and in some cases, one business logic would have to be split into many segments across different places, which is a challenge to maintain as the business grows and it also increases communication overhead. In this session, we'd like to present a unique data processing architecture with Apache Spark and Apache Pulsar, a solution, with the core idea of "One data storage, one computing engine, and one API", to solve the problems of Lambda architecture.

Jia Zhai is the co-founder of StreamNative, as well as PMC member of both Apache Pulsar and Apache BookKeeper, and contributes to these two projects continually.
