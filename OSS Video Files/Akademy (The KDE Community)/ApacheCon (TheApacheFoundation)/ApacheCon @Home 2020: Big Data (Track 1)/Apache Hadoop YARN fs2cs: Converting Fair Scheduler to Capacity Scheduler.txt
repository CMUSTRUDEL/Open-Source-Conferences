	Apache Hadoop YARN fs2cs: Converting Fair Scheduler to Capacity Scheduler
Benjamin Teke

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Apache Hadoop YARN has two popular schedulers, Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler. Although the two are based on different principles, convergent evolution pushed them to be similar both in functionality and the feature set they offer. By now it seems to be a good idea to merge the two or chose one over the other so the entire user base can enjoy one unified support effort and knowledge base. In this talk, we will present our approach which is offering users a way to migrate from Fair Scheduler to Capacity Scheduler by exploring migration paths and filling feature parity gaps. We will also talk about challenges and those aspects of the migration need some engineering effort in order to keep the achievements of fine-tuning Fair Scheduler installations over many years. We will explain why Capacity Scheduler is our scheduler of choice, the way we analyzed differences between the two schedulers, how we found migration paths, and finally, we will present a tool (fs2cs) we developed to help users automate the process.

Benjamin is a senior software developer with many years of experience in the presentation of bigdata for the telecom industry (mainly Kafka and HBase). Since early 2020, he has been an integral part of the YARN team at Cloudera. He gained general knowledge in YARN, and recently he started to specialise in Schedulers. He lives in Budapest and besides his interest in photography and cars, he is passionately automatizing his home via IoT.
