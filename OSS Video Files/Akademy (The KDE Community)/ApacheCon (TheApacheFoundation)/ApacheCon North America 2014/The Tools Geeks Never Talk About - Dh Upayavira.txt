so yes I guess first of all what why

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,090
talk about the tool the tool that geeks

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,969
use but I should probably say seldom

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,430
talked about what I was just thinking is

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:25,199
that that you could say what makes us

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:27,539
human beings stand out from animals you

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,420
know it kind of starts with that the

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:34,320
opposable thumb enabled us to start

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,989
making tools yeah it enabled us to start

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:43,559
making making tools that made us more

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:46,430
effective now this progression has

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,460
carried on through countless eons or

00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,610
centuries decade and so millennia to the

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,879
point where we reach now who do you

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,570
think in our society in our culture are

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,210
the most effective tool makers and tool

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,380
users I'd like to argue that geeks

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,060
really do that you know it's like that's

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,650
what we're about it's like actually no I

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,360
want to be lazy I don't want to do this

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,580
again I'm going to make myself a tools

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,670
that I don't have to ever do it again so

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,920
the constant search for for the latest

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,130
tool the latest thing to make my life

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,720
easier just seems to be kind of like de

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:31,380
rigueur for fergie a practicing geek and

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,310
technologists but there is this one tool

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,549
that I'm positing here that regardless

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,290
of your background regardless of your

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:42,720
technology stacker you are your dot net

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:48,140
developer or a unix based developer Java

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:51,479
whatever we all use it without our mind

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:56,450
we are not much different from a piece

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,450
of stone yeah so

00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,180
okay so i would like to do a little

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,200
exercise I'd like you to just to do a

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,500
little exercise for me okay so i would

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,860
like you all to if you've got your

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,500
laptop open I'd like you to close it and

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,480
if you've got your phone up with you

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:28,260
switch it off okay right now that wasn't

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,870
really the exercise what I would like

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:36,480
you to do is to just observe how did you

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:39,630
feel when I said that yeah did you feel

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,310
annoyed did you feel frustrated what the

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,340
hell is he talking about or did you feel

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,440
gloating I haven't got my laptop open

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:52,080
yeah oh you know what was your response

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:55,350
in that moment yeah so that is hopefully

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,470
a simple example of how we can how we

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:02,490
are constantly responding to stimuli

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:05,430
around us all of the time yeah that

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:09,080
little thing happens moment by moment by

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,970
moment throughout our entire lives and

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,970
particularly in this context throughout

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,930
our working lives yep so as we're

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,760
interacting with other people they're

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,090
doing things that may well cause these

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,760
reactions yep the more conscious we can

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:33,810
be of that the more the more scope we

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,480
have to just okay yeah I'm annoyed right

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,230
okay rather than just hitting out and

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,030
fighting back or pushing back etc yep so

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,780
that that I hope gives you a little

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:50,880
flavor of how a little bit of being

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:55,440
being a little bit more aware of what's

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:59,880
going on for us in the moment can have a

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,860
distinct and substantial impact on our

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:08,400
experience of life and also our

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:10,380
effectiveness in our work yeah so first

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,489
a little bit about me actually I'm not

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,370
going to read any of that because it's

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,150
already been said and the bit that's not

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,769
said on there

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:26,090
is just say why am I talking about this

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:30,539
topic so I've I've been a Buddhist for a

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,789
meditator for some 20 years i was given

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:35,009
my Buddhist named Lupe avira which I'm

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:38,880
sure structure is unusual in the year

00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,419
2000 so I've been meditating and

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,729
practicing mindfulness and teaching

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:50,729
meditation for you know probably a

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:52,889
decade and a half now but what's been

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,660
happening is asked to talk about in a

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,340
few moments is there's a new development

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,169
or well there's a development that's

00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,760
kind of capturing the popular

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,370
consciousness of this thing called

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,979
mindfulness yeah so I just want to say

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,300
my background is you know I've been

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,820
meditating I've been practicing

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,639
mindfulness but i'm not a certified

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,960
trainer in the the thing that they call

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:23,310
mindfulness yeah that may come in time

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:26,250
but not yet so so what is mindfulness so

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,180
Jon kabat-zinn is the chap who

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,919
formulated this particular approach and

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:37,770
he said of it this is his short

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:42,599
definition paying attention in the

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,880
present moment non-judgmentally so we're

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,919
paying attention we're not doing we're

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,979
not paying attention to the past or to

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,690
the future plant you know considering

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,729
what happened in that meeting and oh no

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,560
what have I got to do next no we're

00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:01,620
seeing what's here and now what I'm you

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:03,360
know right back how am I now and so

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,419
paying attention in the present moment

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,229
non-judgmentally long judgmentally is is

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:16,169
is a really really important part of it

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:18,270
so and if any of you wonder what that is

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:22,889
good just a quick show of hands who here

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:25,650
is familiar with scrum yeah most people

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,260
here okay so at the end of a scrum

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,710
period yeah you finish the scrum and

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,740
then you

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,690
have a retrospective yep familiar with

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,220
that idea so you come with your team and

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,890
you say okay what worked and what didn't

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,080
work so now maybe one colleague set says

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,110
actually we tried to develop that module

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,420
and we completely got the scope of it

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,980
wrong it was far too much effort for the

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,490
time we had and we all got turned into

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,050
stress balls it was horrible and would

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,850
one of your colleagues say well actually

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,400
it doesn't really surprise me because it

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,820
was your fault you messed up you know

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,040
that's not what you do is it in us in a

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,710
retrospective it's saying okay that's

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,800
interesting yes that didn't feel right

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,870
did it so how can we respond differently

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,440
how can we act differently in relation

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:16,020
to this so in in this context in the

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,120
context of mindfulness I might find

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,220
myself in a situation where I'm thinking

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:27,000
oh Jesus that da him I touched I want to

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:33,030
rip his head off oh okay and I'm aware

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,420
of that okay yeah so and i'm not i'm not

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:40,290
saying to myself and i'm a bad person

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:43,470
because i feel that yeah it's just it's

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,510
just what's there yeah so that's that

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,840
that's where I see the sort of the

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,460
non-judgmental quality and personally I

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,830
think that's just incredibly powerful if

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:57,960
we learn to to just see what's there

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:03,300
just opens all sups of all sorts of

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:08,990
possibilities up hang on press the wrong

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,990
button there so

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,650
so i mentioned jon kabat-zinn and how he

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,419
create he formulated this particular

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:25,039
approach to mindfulness you know the the

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,569
the ideas of mindfulness go back

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,030
millennia they've been taught through

00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:32,120
through spiritual traditions for a long

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,490
time jon kabat-zinn formulated it into

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:39,039
what he called mindfulness based stress

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:43,130
reduction in some sometime around 1979

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,450
more recently the amount of research

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,630
that's been done on it has been

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,399
increasing over time actually I saw a

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,649
graph of the number of research papers

00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,740
published on the subject and it was

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:58,450
literally exponential to the point where

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,450
there I think it was some 397 academic

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:06,740
studies were done on mindfulness into

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:11,450
the year 2011 so there's a growing body

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:15,490
of research that aims to look at the the

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:18,950
impact of some very simple practices on

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:22,370
behavior on the structure of the

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:32,180
structure of the brain as we'll see in a

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:34,550
couple of slides time so in fact of all

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,620
this research is that it's becoming more

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,770
widely accepted as an approach as a

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,120
thing to do to the point where

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:46,250
mindfulness was recently taught in the

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:49,970
UK government it's been used by the US

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,760
military the UK obviously you can tell

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,610
i'm from the UK the the national

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,640
institute of clinical excellence which

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,160
is responsible for defining UK health

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,079
practice practice has recommended

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,199
mindfulness as a suitable treatment for

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,050
depression so it's really kind of found

00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:14,209
its way into our culture and a lot of

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,209
thats because there's been so much

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:20,870
research has been done to show that it

00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:23,240
has positive impacts so just want to

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,360
read a couple of

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:31,139
things here so there have been studies

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,920
at in in Harvard and elsewhere have

00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:37,230
shown that after an eight week course of

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,449
mindfulness training there is a

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,209
significant increase in brain grey

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:44,490
matter concentration in areas associated

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:48,569
with sustained attention emotional

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,639
regulation and perspective taking the

00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:52,949
training also increases activity in your

00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,459
left prefrontal cortex which is a

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:58,800
predictor of happiness and well-being

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:03,230
yeah so that that's just an example of

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:07,220
some of the directly identified and

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,829
scientifically proven benefits of this

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:14,790
also a study carried out by by of all

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:16,259
people the US US Marine Corps found that

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,660
those Marines who were trained in

00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:22,350
mindfulness experienced improved mood

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,620
and working memory under pressure they

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,670
were more capable of complex thought and

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:32,399
problem-solving and they had better

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:40,680
control of their emotions yep so suggest

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:42,480
is quite kind of potent stuff and not

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,600
only that it's also being taken up in

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,589
the in the IT world recently so Google

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,910
has its own I don't think that donor

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,459
that they call it mindfulness training

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,290
but part of their mentorship program

00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,290
includes mindfulness elements

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:12,150
so I think what I'd like to do now is to

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:16,050
say do you fancy trying some if you have

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:21,600
a go yep so all I'm going to say is if

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:23,430
we just all if you don't want to that's

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,900
absolutely fine it's to purely an

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,910
invitation it's good we're going to do

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,930
maybe 5-7 minutes of sitting quietly

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,760
potentially with it with our eyes shut

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,130
if you don't want to that's absolutely

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,720
fine but all I ask you to do is be

00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:43,100
mindful of the other people in the room

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,100
who may want to do it that's all okay so

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,509
so first of all just closing our eyes

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:21,540
feeling ourselves sitting here feeling

00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:21,540
our feet on the floor

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,100
up i'm on the cushion

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,209
feeling our head poised

00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:11,010
now in the midst of all of this we can

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:12,930
notice that we're breathing we're

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:21,990
actually always doing it but we don't

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:23,910
always notice just take our attention to

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,180
the sent to the sensations of our

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,180
breathing

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:40,930
we're not trying to change our breathing

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,930
we're just trying to observe to feel it

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:56,570
maybe looking if we can identify a few

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:59,570
words that describe it is it still

00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,570
agitated

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
rapid or slow

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,070
can you notice the point where our

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,070
breath starts

00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:38,959
notice where the point where our breath

00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:38,959
ends

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:13,260
and remembering the quality of

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,260
non-judgment just checking in with

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,700
what's our mind doing our thoughts

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:27,129
just being interested we is it easy to

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:33,519
stay with the breath the sensations of

00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:37,059
the breath or are my minds busy thinking

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,749
about the latest project or planning the

00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,749
rest of the day

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:15,370
when you're ready maybe taking a deep

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:16,990
breath opening your eyes and perhaps

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:21,730
it's now it's interesting to just ask

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:24,790
yourself a simple question you know how

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:30,340
was that and how do you feel now does it

00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:33,130
feel feel any different yeah you know in

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,590
a way I can't predict there's too many

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,910
of you and as many people as there are

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,320
in the room there's that many different

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,940
responses to it yeah but perhaps if you

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,520
do feel a little bit calmer a little bit

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,100
Stiller maybe a little bit clearer

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,809
reminded maybe you saw what was going on

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,520
in your mind and think oh my god it's

00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:57,700
busy isn't it yep all those repeated

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,690
doing that simple thing in a repeated

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:07,559
way just a small portion of it like that

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,559
can make a huge difference over time as

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,840
moving on to the next slide that one is

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,309
just a nice picture I thought it was a

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,520
nice picture search thought I'd show it

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:20,710
but this one actually shows the sort of

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,470
thing that can actually be going on in

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:27,400
your own brain by doing what we've just

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:33,850
done yeah so you can see on the left is

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:40,500
a baseline scan and on the right you can

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:43,330
see an increase in active brain matter

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:49,270
when the particular person was actually

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:51,820
meditating yep so direct tangible impact

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:55,419
on the structure of the brain activating

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:58,179
more parts of your brain making your

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:00,910
brain work better tempted for me it

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,950
increases I've found that it has it

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,640
helped increase my not so much my

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,590
efficiency by my effectiveness just

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,470
being able to take that step back see

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,630
what I need to do and just be be ready

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:18,090
to do the right thing much much more

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,090
readily than I was in years gone by

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:29,910
so well we've actually done that haven't

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:31,230
we so here's some if any of you are

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,640
interested I imagine these slides we

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,350
made available afterwards there's some

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,770
resources that you can look up if you're

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:43,440
interested my own company doko we're

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:47,280
focusing on at the moment particularly

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,220
on IT training but we're also looking at

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,169
as a team how to make sure we use

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:56,010
mindfulness in the way we interact with

00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:59,190
each other so that in order to make our

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:02,549
work more effective and we are able to

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,650
offer services if people are interested

00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,990
in taking mindfulness into your

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:12,240
workplace to look at how it can make

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:16,070
your work that bit more efficient then

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:20,100
we can certainly help with that so

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:21,330
that's all I have to say I guess we've

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,110
got a few moments for questions if

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,110
people want to

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,330
or is everyone so still and chilled out

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,330
of that short meditation

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:44,659
yep oh we have one yes

00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:02,309
so the question was how to force

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:04,470
yourself to do it I guess the way I see

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,750
that is actually usually not you know if

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,570
you look at how we are none of us are

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,830
one way none of us are one person we're

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,570
actually have all these different bits

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,000
at one part of us wants to do it and the

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:18,390
rest of us can't be bothered yeah that's

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,080
quite common so yes what you're saying

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:24,059
is establishing habits so for a long

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,670
time I would just roll out of bed and

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:29,280
land on my meditation cushion and that

00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,860
was the way I did it in the morning and

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,740
I didn't think about it beforehand so

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,900
finding places where in your light in

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,809
your life pattern where where it works

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,280
but also I think one of the key things

00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,100
that the mindfulness movement has

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,280
brought is that actually sitting when

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,280
you can sit on your bum for two hours a

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,950
day and leave afterwards and be as

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:58,050
irascible and annoying and everything as

00:21:52,950 --> 00:22:00,480
as ever yeah the key is when you bring

00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:04,590
what you gain from there into your

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,910
everyday life so simple things like we

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,470
all have one's going to wave this around

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,960
as a mobile phone it's not but pretend

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,900
it was you know how about a simple thing

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,760
of every time your mobile phone rings

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,179
making a commitment not to answer it for

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,370
at least two rings yeah so I'm going to

00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,320
and win it when it's ringing I'm just

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,390
going to stop I'm going to take my mind

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,750
off what I'm doing I'm going to take a

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,360
deep breath recollect myself look at

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,720
who's ringing and then say okay I'm now

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,650
ready to communicate with you go yeah so

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,660
looking for for those sorts of gaps in

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,210
our lives maybe just deciding that

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:46,230
actually whenever I walk upstairs I'm

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:49,559
going to feel my feet pressing on the

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:54,140
steps as I go yeah looking for things

00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:57,929
like that where and also keep it small

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,910
yeah if you want to establish a ripper

00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:01,920
and I practice doing this sort of thing

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,110
to gain the benefits of it long term if

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,220
you if the first thing you decide is I'm

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,100
going to do two hours of meditation

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,720
every day it will not work

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,289
but if you say I'm going to do a minute

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,000
a day yeah may then once you really

00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:21,990
start enjoying it and benefiting from it

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,590
getting that up to five is easy yeah so

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:29,220
I hope that that this is useful and that

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,880
it can help bring benefit to you in both

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,030
in your personalized and in your work

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,030
