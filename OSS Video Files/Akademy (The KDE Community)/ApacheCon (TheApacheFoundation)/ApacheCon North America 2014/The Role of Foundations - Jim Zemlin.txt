all right talking about foundations in

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,130
front of the apache software foundation

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,590
crowd is intimidating so i just want to

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,190
start by saying I don't purport to know

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:18,900
everything about foundations or open

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:21,300
source I I used to subscribe to mailing

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,800
lists that discuss these matters license

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,170
discuss if some of you are on these

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,500
mailing list there's few others and I

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,410
finally just had to unsubscribe because

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,059
it's just a huge volume in terms of you

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,649
know talking about the differences

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,170
between foundations and open-source

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,000
licenses and things like that so today I

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,010
thought I would just give you my

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,780
perspective the perspective that we're

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,110
seeing from the linux foundation on the

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,440
role of foundations in software and the

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,570
IT industry but I again I don't purport

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,680
to know everything so take everything i

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,829
say with a small grain of salt i also

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,489
want to say this is not my first apache

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,019
con this has anybody i think there are a

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,820
few people in the audience here who know

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,939
that I've had some experience with the

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,060
apache software foundation in the past

00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:15,509
in fact I attended my first Apache con

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,939
in the UK quite a long time ago I think

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,259
this must have been 2002-2003 I can't

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,119
remember the exact date 2000 come on

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,250
guys you're giving your dating me a you

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,479
know you see you're already calling me

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,939
out but there I am in the far right-hand

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,860
side of my right over there and you can

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,869
see a bunch of folks there yeah but the

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,299
most notable guy is in the center there

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,479
that's Douglas Adams may he rest in

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,649
peace who was the far better keynote

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,280
than I could ever be at that Apache con

00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:53,399
but you know one of the things that I I

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,680
think qualifies me for for speaking

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,920
today and you know kind of what we do

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,340
and what I do at the Linux Foundation

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,460
centers around this guy how many people

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,290
here know who that is pretty much ever

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,910
so that's Lena store vaults the creator

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:21,340
of Linux ah and I am actually we

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:25,030
Torvalds boss that's right i'm also the

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,900
boss of this girl that's my

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,870
five-year-old daughter Nisha uh and

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,520
what's interesting is Leah swear balls

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:39,550
in my daughter Nisha are actually very

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:43,920
similar no it's it's true first they're

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,810
both adorable don't you think second

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,340
they're clearly both geniuses in

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:54,040
particular my daughter but most

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,750
importantly neither of them listen to

00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,460
anything that I say right and so

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,050
essentially that's what I do at the

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,720
Linux Foundation that's what the Linux

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,360
Foundation does I pay leanest torvalds

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,850
paycheck and we have a bunch of stuff

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,370
around Lena stet help the colonel

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,760
community do the great work they do but

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,920
really the great work that goes on at

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,380
the linux foundation in linux really is

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,530
testimony to the power of the individual

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,320
developer the power of the kind of work

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,140
that each of you do every day it's

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,650
amazing that you know a developer like

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:39,180
this likeliness torvalds over 20 years

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:43,900
ago can start a project that changes

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,510
development itself that really spawns

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,209
company is worth billions of dollars and

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,270
really changes the world and if you

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,420
think about it what was that software

00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:01,770
that Lena's Torvalds created that

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:05,290
changed development anybody know you're

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:08,680
thinking Linux but it was actually get

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,959
the guy yet it's like two holes-in-one

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,820
this guy right you know he had the right

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,950
you know not only Linux but he had to

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,540
write it and then this is not a promo

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,000
forget and I realized that there are

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,750
other things out there that are equally

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,580
good all right I have to kind of defend

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,980
Lina sigh we're partial to get over at

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,660
the Linux Foundation but the reason I'm

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,500
get is because get did change the way

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,790
software is developed in a way that

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,910
problem I'm sure that Lina's did did not

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,820
expect but what it did do is in

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,580
particular in conjunction with github

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,460
and there are other forges that are

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,400
similar it sort of brought in the era of

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:54,280
social coding right which i think is

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,860
really important and I kind of took a

00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,660
look at this by looking at github and

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,510
looking at the impact that github has

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,780
had on big open source projects as of

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:10,390
late and what you can see here is on the

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,000
vertical you've got github stars a sort

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,770
of indication of popularity the size of

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,050
the circle is the size of the

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,250
development community and then you've

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:24,180
got time and what you're seeing here are

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:28,240
projects like bootstrap nodejs angularjs

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,160
that have leveraged the social coding

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,940
and the infrastructure around github and

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:40,480
get to grow insanely fast these projects

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,850
really exploded I mean it is just

00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,030
amazing to see how they're leveraging it

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:49,420
and I bring this up because I get asked

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:51,850
a question a lot about github relative

00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,260
to foundations and I think yesterday in

00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,880
one of the keynotes i actually heard

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,380
someone mentioned this is well relative

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,570
to the apache software foundation you

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,410
probably get asked the same question

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:06,040
which is if you've got github what do

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,050
you need with the foundation right can't

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,610
you just why don't you just I mean seems

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,520
to be working right why don't you just

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,270
throw your code up on github and things

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,480
are going to explode and so that's the

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,410
question I want to explore with all of

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,660
you guys today is what is the role of

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,560
foundations in this sort of post github

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,480
era where you can throw code up on a

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,700
forage and these projects seemed to

00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,770
explode and what I would say to that and

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,160
my answer that is sort of multi full but

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,400
the fur

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,990
thing I would say to that is foundations

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,270
enable social coding I me ask yourself I

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,190
just said github really was a

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,290
breakthrough in terms of large-scale

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,990
social coding right so which is it D is

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,880
it is it things like github in forges or

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,600
is it foundations that enables social

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:06,160
coding well when I think of social

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:10,750
coding I think of more than just coding

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:14,860
via github see for me this is non-social

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:17,290
coding right and this is kind of a funny

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,730
picture very popular on the internet but

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,980
it's the idea that sort of people are

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,270
isolated in their own environment in

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,770
their own room and they're doing this

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:29,260
coding and its social over the internet

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,110
but it's not social in the way that I

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,650
think is important and that really is

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:40,660
the reason we're all here this is social

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:44,170
coding all of you being here is social

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,100
coding one of the things that we really

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:52,060
want to do at the linux foundation is

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:56,169
provide events like this the reason is

00:07:52,060 --> 00:08:00,030
social coding isn't just about IRC and

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:03,340
github and email list and so forth

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,650
coding is really not only about the code

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,780
itself let us about the trust

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,470
relationships that are developed over

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,870
long period of time amongst developers

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:17,520
that are creating software that's

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:21,160
literally changing the world and so

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,020
events like this are extremely important

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,790
to the Linux Foundation I think that

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,250
they're extremely important to the asf

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,200
when I first started working on events

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,900
at the Linux Foundation over almost ten

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,810
years ago the only reason we were doing

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:39,520
it was to enable faster collaboration

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,260
technical collaboration we didn't create

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,940
it we didn't want to create a trade show

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,140
there were tons of Linux trade shows at

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,610
the time what we really wanted to do was

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,400
create a place where technical

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,930
developers can get together and hash out

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,520
the things that just aren't

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,690
getting hashed out over a mailing list

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,250
or by other means and it really worked

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,080
if you go to a Linux event they're very

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,510
tight that we're producing they're very

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,029
technical and it's really a way for

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,370
developers to get together and hash this

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,839
stuff out and move forward and we've

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,029
been doing that successfully for 10

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,550
years and clearly you need a foundation

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,910
to do that you can't have an Apache Khan

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,890
without the apache software foundation

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,290
but there's more things that foundations

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,380
do that I think are important and

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,690
they're important in the context of sort

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,870
of the future of large-scale software

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,820
development and Mark sort of alluded to

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,800
this in his talk but at the Linux

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,240
Foundation we think that foundations

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,880
enable large-scale and structured

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,480
investment in open source projects and

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,720
in technology writ large and this is

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,990
really important you don't get this just

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,380
throwing code up on a forge you have to

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,300
have infrastructure around a project to

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,880
do this and I'll explain what that looks

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,600
like but what I first want to look at is

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:09,040
the nature of investment in tech at

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,890
large the top 10 tech companies in the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,870
world in the IT industry spend about 63

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,920
billion dollars on research and

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:20,110
development it is a big number here's

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,890
what the numbers look like Microsoft

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:27,100
nine billion Cisco 5.8 billion Google

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,990
five billion these are huge numbers

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,470
these are the numbers that they're

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,020
suspending on RD inside of their

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,839
companies working on a wide variety of

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,550
newfangled stuff that they hope to bring

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,070
the market and sell all of us and we're

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,050
all going to love it and when I talk to

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,950
organizations like this i always ask

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:53,200
them one question how do you manage your

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:55,450
external research and development this

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,610
is the big change that's going on in the

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,279
IT industry that really the open source

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:04,029
movement was the vanguard of but is now

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,579
becoming institutionalized it's the idea

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,369
that all of us are smarter than any

00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:11,019
one of us it's the idea that research

00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,869
and development no longer is about

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,459
hiring a bunch of super smart folks

00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:17,290
locking them in a room hoping they'll

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,660
come up with some brilliant idea in

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,959
isolation and then going and selling

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,420
that to the world research development

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,790
is about development that happens inside

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,519
your company but increasingly outside of

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,660
your organization's through open source

00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:37,149
the Linux kernel alone is a

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,730
multi-billion dollar R&D investment that

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:43,299
you know thousands and thousands of

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,879
companies leverage to you know produce

00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:48,939
us you know products and services that

00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,279
run most of modern society you know the

00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:53,110
asf is hosting similar large-scale

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,889
projects that really have an import on

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,929
society so how is industry doing this

00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:01,899
how are people managing their external

00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:04,689
research and development well it's

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:07,600
interesting they've got pros there are

00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:09,970
professionals within the better tech

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,910
companies who recognize some time ago

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,529
that managing external rd that

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,739
participating in the open source

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:20,619
community isn't just something you do ad

00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:24,819
hoc or haphazardly it's something that

00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:27,119
you have professional people manage the

00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:30,819
folks are looking at here Chris DiBona

00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:32,679
you know Alan Clark Ibrahim Haddad mark

00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:36,009
Hinkel up there mark you got to change

00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:40,299
your LinkedIn profile pic by the way dan

00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:42,790
fry at IBM these folks full-time job is

00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:44,709
managing external rd for their companies

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,160
and they're the largest technology

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:50,199
companies in the world in many cases

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,329
they're they're not only full-time job

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,959
is to do that they actually have very

00:12:52,329 --> 00:13:00,089
large organizations in some cases with

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:03,309
hundreds of people who decide what code

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:05,799
leaves an organization what code comes

00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:07,480
into the organization how to share what

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,019
they want to share how to keep what they

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,299
want to keep that study the IP regimes

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:15,129
for of all of this open source code that

00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:17,379
they're consuming that make sure that

00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,440
license compliance happens when code is

00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,630
shipped in a product

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,810
who really have suspense systematized

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,790
where their engineers should spend their

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,650
time which up-and-coming open source

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,000
project should they assign engineers to

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,100
because in the future they might

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,960
leverage that external research and

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,150
development in the products and services

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,300
that they're going to have this is a

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,010
huge professional endeavor that some of

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,910
the best companies in tech have been

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,490
doing for quite some time but are really

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:53,550
doing more and more systematically as of

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:56,490
late and the result is impressive these

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,790
companies are leveraging billions of

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,890
dollars of free software you know I mean

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,140
in just in the consumer electronic

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,720
industry alone nobody really makes

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,420
anything these days without open source

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,740
in it even if you have an iPhone you

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,780
know people think of Apple as this

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,180
incredibly closed proprietary software

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,880
company but if you go into your iPhone

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,150
your iPad into the general about and

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,250
legal notices section you'll find code

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,590
in there from the asf you'll find the

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,960
GPL license in there you will find lots

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,850
and lots of open source code nobody

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,710
builds anything these days without open

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,300
source because you just aren't going to

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,470
get to market fast enough you're you're

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,020
not going to be able to do it on your

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,390
own the folks who manage this external

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,330
rd are in charge of leveraging billions

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,100
of dollars i would say equal in value to

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,670
the billions of dollars of internal R&D

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,740
that goes on in these companies as well

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,800
these folks align their business with

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:56,250
upstream projects we see in the kernel

00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,270
community for example that companies are

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,910
actually building device support for

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,670
their products with the intention of

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,070
getting that patch upstream the day that

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,650
the product product goes to market they

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,330
literally have this lockstep development

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,160
approach as they're building a product

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:17,190
making sure that the code that they're

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,800
going to need long term is up to snuff

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,820
to get into the mainline kernel right

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,530
because they don't want to have to

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,780
constantly be forking open-source

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,370
projects and then maintaining these

00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,230
Forks for long period of time that would

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,170
defeat the whole purpose of why they got

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,790
into using this great shared external

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,250
research and development

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,440
most importantly I think these folks are

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,820
in charge of sharing what they want to

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,820
share and keeping what they want to keep

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,769
I still get questions today from

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,430
different sectors of the tech industry

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:49,959
or even folks that are not intact it you

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,209
know maybe the automotive industry is a

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,579
decent example saying you know well if I

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:56,290
use open source in a car does that mean

00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,050
I have to give away all my intellectual

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,360
property which of course folks here at

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,279
the SF no is not the case if you

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,649
understand open-source licenses and how

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,420
they work it's very easy to share what

00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:11,230
you want to share and keep what you want

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,730
to keep from an IP perspective and then

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,899
I think one of the most important things

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,480
that we're seeing at the Linux

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,209
Foundation today is that companies who

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,779
have open source friendly policies are

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,759
actually using that to hire the best

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,980
developers in the world I mean there's

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,829
really a huge war going a talent war

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,920
going on in the tech industry that's

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,050
best exemplified by the antitrust suits

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,730
that were recently bought where you know

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,430
large companies we're basically

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,010
colluding to not poach each other's inch

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,410
in here's right that talent is so

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,579
important software tail in particular so

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,069
important these companies were willing

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:50,699
to break the law in order to get that

00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:53,529
talent and what we're seeing is that

00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:56,470
open source friendly companies really do

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,750
attract the best talent and the best

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,600
talent also comes from open source if

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,089
you get a patch into a major open source

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,179
project in many cases it's a guarantee

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,679
for a job particularly in the linux

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,079
kernel we're seeing you know if you get

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:15,689
a patch in their employers are calling

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:17,919
you instantly and so as this

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,839
professionalization happens in terms of

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,049
managing external research and

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,720
development leveraging all of this

00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:28,120
open-source foundations are also

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,380
starting to play a critical role and

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:34,210
that role is really the role that the

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,409
asf for the Linux Foundation or a

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,270
variety of other foundations play and

00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:42,010
you know I think at the asf you stated

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,610
very well I've kind of simplified it

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,110
here it's a neutral place

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:53,320
where resources can be collected and

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:57,460
shared I mean that's kind of the root of

00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:01,559
what you're doing right and these are

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,150
not small resources these are huge

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,700
multi-million dollar investments that

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,920
people want to make the whether it's

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,690
through developers in terms of their

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,320
time amounting to millions and millions

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,090
of dollars in value or actual money or

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,880
intellectual property that's being

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,730
donated from within a company into an

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,510
open source project what the industry is

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:28,290
really saying is we need a neutral place

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,840
to know that we're sharing this stuff

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,059
collectively and that no single actor

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,020
can kind of game the system to their

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:41,919
advantage right and what's interesting

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:44,950
is there's a historical precedent for

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,290
that and the historical precedent is

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:51,250
really standards development

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:55,600
organizations SDOs and what we're really

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:59,140
seeing here is open-source now filling

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,500
the role in a organized way through

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,320
foundations that standards developing

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,380
organizations have played in the

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,720
industry for many many years it used to

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,640
be when industry the tech sector in

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,030
particular wanted to collaborate they

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,360
would go to ISO or I Triple E or some

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,440
standards organization these are

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,610
professional you know i'll call them

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,429
foundations SDOs that have very large

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,530
staff that managing electoral property

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,450
albeit in a very different way as an

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,650
open source foundation but are in the

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,240
intellectual property management

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,340
business in selves it's where people can

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,110
get together in a way that's antitrust

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,730
free to go and do this form of

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,970
collaboration and they would produce

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,160
these you know thousand page specs and

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:48,820
they would hand them to people and then

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,770
folks would go out and implement them or

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,990
in some cases they would ignore the spec

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,760
see entirely and then they would create

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,590
this network effect and they would

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,940
become this sort of de facto standard

00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,170
than they would create this monopoly

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,410
that would Dom

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:09,910
the industry forever but those days are

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:11,440
over not that I take it personally but

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,090
those days are over and I want to give

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,480
you a recent example of it that I think

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:18,280
epitomizes this best so where we host

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,410
the linux foundation is kind of becoming

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,990
a foundation of foundations the lack of

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,990
a better term so we host a foundation

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,520
that was recently launched last year

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,730
late in the year in december called the

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,420
all seen alliance and this is a project

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,310
for the Internet of Things it's a code

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,980
base that basically allows it's a

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:42,070
framework essentially for proximity

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,100
networks on you know tiny little things

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,170
in the home smartphones automobiles

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,360
connected light bulbs and so forth that

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,820
allows you know a light bulb to be

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,370
discovered on a network to be able to

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,350
sort of publish its capabilities and

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,180
then to be able to interact with other

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,300
things in the house a television set a

00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,910
stereo a speaker whatever it might be

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:06,130
but what's interesting is there have

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,170
been a lot of standard setting efforts

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,360
in the Internet of Things to go out and

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:14,140
define interoperability at that sort of

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,260
proximity sort of edge of the the

00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,750
network of IOT you know to enable

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,040
devices to DLNA i think is probably one

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,020
of the better examples this is a

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,930
standard that a specification that

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:29,740
allows audio streaming to sort of happen

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:34,480
and when the folks in this foundation

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:38,980
companies like Qualcomm companies like

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:44,160
LG Panasonic Cisco all got together what

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:46,440
they said was I cannot hand a 600-page

00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,820
specification to a light bulb

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,060
manufacturer and hope that this is

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:55,090
actually going to work it's just not

00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,710
going to happen right and so they said

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,390
listen what we want to do is create

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,310
interoperability but we're going to do

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,110
that by all working off a common code

00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:05,530
base and that will create the standard

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,060
and that will create not only the better

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,610
interoperability that we're looking for

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,880
but the actual code that folks can go

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,260
take and use to create these incredible

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,270
experiences that you're going to see you

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,740
know maybe a year from now there are

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,240
actual products that are coming out in

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,480
the market this year based on that code

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,610
base probably would have taken several

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,500
years to even get a specification

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,210
developed right but these things are

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,450
actually going to be in the market this

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,480
year so I think it's important that the

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:37,330
world is moving in this direction from

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,620
SDOs to really organize foundations that

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:42,370
are enabling this kind of large-scale

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:44,140
open-source development another

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,770
interesting thing that I thought about

00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:51,940
when thinking about foundations was sort

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:53,710
of why do you need a neutral place right

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,900
because there you know I looked at like

00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:00,880
nodejs and these things and you know

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,110
these are uh code bases in many cases

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
trademarks they're owned by one company

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,530
you know my sequel might have been a

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,270
good example of where you can go kind of

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,790
have a corporate open source project and

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,160
that worked and I looked at a study from

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:15,210
a few years ago that stated that there

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,940
appears to be a glass ceiling on the

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:22,990
growth of large single vendor open

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,810
source projects that at a certain point

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,420
if a project gets important enough if

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:31,540
the industry decides they want to use it

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,750
it really are large-scale if it's

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,650
controlled by a single vendor even if

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:41,320
it's open source it just doesn't make it

00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:45,250
it just doesn't get as big as the ones

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,000
that have a neutral home and I think

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:51,520
that it'll be interesting to see in the

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,940
post github era where you can kind of

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,150
get this explosive growth even if it's

00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,400
sort of a single vendor product project

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,740
if that will be sustainable over long

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,350
periods of time or if those projects as

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,930
well will hit a glass ceiling and will

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,930
eventually need to make their way into a

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,820
neutral home so that people can do the

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,390
kind of large-scale systematic

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,460
investment that I'm characterizing it

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,840
and I don't know if that will happen but

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,520
i think it is likely to happen i think

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,430
that this glass ceiling will likely

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:30,830
remain and i think that you will see

00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:32,510
more foundations come into being I think

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,700
you will see more projects come to the

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,010
asf I think you will see other

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,290
foundations emerge where they want to

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,360
set up their own unique structure of

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,580
governance you see the OpenStack

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,450
foundation launched you know a few years

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:51,680
ago and has had pretty decent success so

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,600
far the opendaylight project is it had

00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,830
its first birthday yesterday how many

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,100
people here know of the opendaylight

00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:01,490
project so the opendaylight project has

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,100
its own foundation they just won the

00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,080
interop grand prize the first open

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,820
source project that ever won the Best in

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,250
Show at interop which is sort of the

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,860
Oscars of the networking industry after

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,680
just one year this shows just how

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:20,510
important these large-scale projects

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,940
really are so I think I've established

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,080
that foundations like the asf like the

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,820
Linux Foundation like these others are

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,370
important and that they're sort of

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,950
taking the role of what SEOs used to do

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:34,280
in the past but the the next question is

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,630
what is the real work of an open source

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,420
foundation now this is where we sort of

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,180
get into the details right and I thought

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,000
I would talk about the work that I do at

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,310
the Linux Foundation as an example sort

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,440
of what the work the actual work that is

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,110
done at a foundation looks like I

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,910
thought I'd borrow an internet meme too

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,830
to make that point so I think you're

00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:01,520
probably all are aware of this internet

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:03,140
meme but this is really what my friends

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,820
think I do at the Linux Foundation what

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,610
I'm actually what I'm doing right now I

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,340
travel around the world I give speeches

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,320
I pontificate about these broad IT

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,260
trends and how they intersect with open

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,810
sores that's the cool job that I have at

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:22,910
the Linux Foundation now what my mom

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:24,140
thinks I do is more like this you know

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,820
and this has really nothing to do with

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,200
the Linux Foundation my mom I just I

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,310
love her so much she just thinks I'm a

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
boy scout is because she has no idea

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,870
what I do actually but she just happens

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,280
to think I'm more like a boy scout

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,950
society of course thinks this is what

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,260
the Linux Foundation does

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,230
you guys have gotten this too I knew it

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,330
I knew it your all what are you sharing

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,820
everything you should have seen the

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,860
crestfallen look on my wife's face on

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,600
our first date when I told her I worked

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,750
at a non-profit it was just it was this

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,600
palpable look of disappointment she

00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:01,190
still married me though this is what

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,220
developers think I do this is I kind of

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,440
you know they don't really do anything

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,330
and I give these speeches but they again

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,240
and I talk a lot but obviously in this

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,760
sort of not so nice way and make really

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,620
no sense am totally incoherent I I hope

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,299
that's not what people think but I very

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,190
suspicious that's what many developers

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:23,029
think of me now of course here's what I

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,250
think of myself right I'm the boss

00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:26,360
Elena's torvalds right it's the greatest

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,769
job in the world I was one of the

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,870
biggest was successful at the source

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:36,590
projects in history that he created but

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:39,289
this is what I actually do and and and

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,059
this is the point of foundations from

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:44,720
the linux foundation's perspective which

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:46,909
is you know I both me and a lot of the

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,850
folks who work at the foundation we're

00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:53,029
kind of the janitor that you know the

00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:58,399
Wi-Fi at the conference is just never

00:27:53,029 --> 00:28:00,409
good enough right we want to keep the

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,529
servers that enable this large-scale

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:06,860
collaboration up and running and secure

00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:08,929
and it could never be good enough we

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:12,380
want to provide a legal framework around

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:15,889
this that allows for the collaboration

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:18,559
process to be defended you know there

00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:21,919
are legal issues with open source that

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,649
need to be defended and we have created

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,559
many structures around open source

00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:31,700
license compliance patent defense in

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:33,409
order to protect and it can never be

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,120
good enough you know in the world of

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:37,309
intellectual property I asked a

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,750
professor at Stanford Law School once

00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:41,600
you know what's the one thing we could

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,429
do to really make and protect open

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,289
source you know whether it's related to

00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:47,090
licensing or patents and his response

00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:50,559
was it's not one thing it's everything

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:55,289
and that's part of being the janitor is

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:57,789
keeping it clean because if you ask me

00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:59,639
what we do at the Linux Foundation or

00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:03,970
anyone who works at the Linux Foundation

00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:07,059
sort of who we work for no one would say

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:10,110
they work for me what they would all say

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:13,419
is that we work for the developers and

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:17,320
even though we have members from huge

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,330
large organizations who you know join

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,710
and give us money to support all of this

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:27,309
work what we tell them is you know we

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,350
will help fit your business to the

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,409
development model that's going on over

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,509
here not vice versa we're not going to

00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:36,460
force the community to conform to your

00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,590
business norms what you're going to do

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,539
is conform to the community norms in

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,539
order to leverage the billions of

00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:46,869
dollars in shared rd that is represented

00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:50,230
in open source and guess what that's

00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:51,879
what victory looks like for open source

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,759
and for foundations like this the

00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:57,730
business community has now realized that

00:29:54,759 --> 00:30:01,600
what you guys started a long time ago is

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:03,490
truly a better way to add value to their

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,950
companies within the structure that

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,440
wasn't established by a company but was

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,879
really established by a community and at

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,499
the Linux Foundation we just sort of

00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:13,480
think of ourselves as the janitor for

00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:16,659
that community to kind of work behind

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,610
the scenes to make it work well working

00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:21,220
with you guys on this event is exactly

00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,740
in line with that coal right we want to

00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,679
be behind the scenes enabling the great

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,679
work that goes on at the asf nothing

00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,919
more nothing less and so I want to leave

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,869
with one interesting question about

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,249
foundations and open source projects

00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:39,399
that have been thinking a lot about

00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:41,499
lately as we get into sort of very large

00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:45,159
scale collaborative element think you

00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:48,279
know big market shaping market-moving

00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:51,730
open-source efforts right that are sort

00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:53,980
of created spontaneously and the

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,779
question comes from the executive

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,159
director of one of the foundations that

00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,840
the linux foundation's hosts the

00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,250
opendaylight project Neela Jacques the

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,810
executive director there asked this

00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:09,810
question which is can you boy band

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:12,510
open source project right Ken companies

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:15,480
get together right and sort of you know

00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,820
in a structured fashion create an open

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,090
source project right that's going to be

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,850
successful you'll kind of like New Kids

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,920
on the Block we're successful right I'm

00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,960
really dating myself now but the

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,880
question is really do the best open

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,970
source projects have to start this way

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,330
right do they have to start in a dorm

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,700
room or you know with a bunch of folks

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,190
who are trading patches over the

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,110
Internet sort of acting spontaneously

00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,020
and kind of does the bottoms-up approach

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:48,390
work or can in this new era where

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,030
business kind of gets open source Nazis

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:54,900
devout can you use a tops down approach

00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:57,780
to create a project right does it really

00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:01,800
have to happen all in you know a dorm

00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:03,510
room at dawn by the way I told Lina that

00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,060
if I ever show a picture of him

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:09,180
shirtless that I would also show a

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:12,020
picture of myself shirtless so you'll

00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:16,970
have to forgive me all that there's

00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:19,400
there I am but will we see more

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:22,610
foundations that will enable large-scale

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,920
collaboration from day one you know i

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,120
would kind of evenly I don't think many

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,980
of these projects would like me to

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,470
characterize them as boy bands of open

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,990
source but these are you know structured

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,910
projects that got together and day one

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,710
wanted to have you to open daylight as a

00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,480
year old they have a hundred fifty

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,330
developers working on the project in a

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,670
million lines of code it took a long

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,850
time for a lot of projects to get to

00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,890
that point and this is me you know the

00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,170
this will be in a half a dozen products

00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,420
this year from very large technology

00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,450
vendors this was a systematic approach

00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:00,170
to open source it seems like it is

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:04,640
working to me I think time will tell but

00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:06,140
it looks like it's working because open

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,000
source foundations I think are really

00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,490
becoming a norm for large-scale R&D and

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,920
if you're over 40 like me you'll get the

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:20,420
reference here but the new kids in the

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,610
block actually Marky Mark became a very

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,990
talented and well esteemed actor over

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,990
time and I think that's what's going to

00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:29,810
happen with foundations I think

00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:32,240
organizations like the asf organizations

00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:35,240
like the Linux Foundation are going to

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,000
be these critical organizations that

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,980
will enable very large scale research

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,260
and development that will be completely

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,110
in line with business and may expand

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,520
beyond the software industry itself we

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,560
host a project in the life sciences

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,430
industry at the Linux Foundation these

00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,350
days because everybody gets it this is

00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,360
what victory looks like this kind of

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,600
large-scale collaborative element that's

00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,690
what foundations do but of course all of

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,870
you already knew that thank you very

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,870
