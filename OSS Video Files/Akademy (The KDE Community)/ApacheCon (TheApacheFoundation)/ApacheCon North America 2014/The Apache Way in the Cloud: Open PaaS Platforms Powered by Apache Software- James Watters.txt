so hey I'm James I work at a company

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,179
called pivotal and I'm here to take a

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,920
few minutes today and share some of my

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,929
experiences in building open source

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,040
projects in the enterprise and just

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,609
generally the different vectors of

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,820
collaboration diffusion some more

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,710
stories and things I've seen so it's not

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,039
really a deep dive technically into the

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,660
product i work on per se but it is a

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,029
little bit of an overview of open source

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,640
at pivotal and my experiences building

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,930
open source communities and projects so

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,570
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,300
what my colleague and the CTO of spring

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,910
source Adrian Collier helping with these

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,440
slides the four C's of open source that

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,780
we're always measuring ourselves and how

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,860
we're doing across these four C's we're

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,480
going to talk about the different

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,539
strategic models we've used to engage

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,469
with a diverse set of communities and

00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,000
finally I'm going to talk a little bit

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,379
more personally about what I like to

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,329
think about is the most important thing

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,910
open source which is the ability to get

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,500
at an eight purpose motive and that is

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,390
someone who's doing something that's

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,040
bigger than themselves bigger than any

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,720
one company they could work for and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,220
there's just a genuine purpose that

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,750
drives them and participating

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,790
intellectually there and there's some

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,229
great talks done by daniel pink who's a

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,299
big inspiration to me that talks about

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,979
if you really want to get high quality

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,840
intellectual work out of somebody you

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,070
have to give them a purpose motive so

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,570
i'm going to finish the talk talking a

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,920
little bit about what you know what gets

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,250
me up in the morning working on the

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,380
project that i work on so the

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,290
interesting thing to me is that this is

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,729
in denver which is where i started my

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,470
career in 1999 and so flying back for me

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,909
here is a little bit of a retrospective

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,560
I started a company called level 3

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,640
communications out in broomfield i

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,140
worked on linux and unix at the time and

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,840
the experiences I had there was we were

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,659
using a lot like gobs and gobs of Sun

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,130
Microsystems stuff with solaris and i

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,159
was one of the first engineers that said

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,500
hey this lenox thing is much faster cost

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
per cost actually is really stable there

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,780
were all these things that people

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,600
flooded it with back in the day I'm like

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,570
no I've had a box up for a year now and

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,890
I ended up actually kind of knowing that

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,869
the challenges would be there moving

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,080
across the hill to sun which also had an

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,680
office in broomfield and eventually

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,239
ended up working

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,659
project called open solaris and what

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,549
happened was about 10 years too late in

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:23,010
2008 we finally shipped an open-source

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,019
edition of our software and I think back

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,879
as i'm working on this current project

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,230
and not to throw my ex-colleagues or the

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,629
people i worked on this with under the

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,129
bus but what did we not get right with

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,560
open solaris is something i was thinking

00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,030
about a lot today and i think the idea

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,829
that was 10 years too late so it should

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,209
have happened in 1998 so i should have

00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:41,099
walked into level 3 and already had a

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,959
competitor linux which was open solaris

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,090
that I could used on any hardware it was

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,500
way too late the other thing was that it

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,970
was a business was in decline that's

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,099
part of the too late and I'll never

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,989
forget this quote from one of the SVP s

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,730
who was leading the project at the time

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,409
we were talking about how to build

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,389
community in there were some strong

00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,060
advocates for a very open and flat and

00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:02,760
more meritocracy based kind of approach

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,409
and the SVP at the time said on its

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,510
still rings in my ears he said open

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:09,389
solaris exists only four sons interests

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,219
and that was kind of this poisonous

00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,599
moment for me and I still I still can't

00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,299
forget it and it didn't end up well and

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,000
so you know at the end of the day Oracle

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,159
acquired it and it wasn't but months

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,720
before it was completely shut down the

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,040
idea of a single vendor controlling it

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,609
this is where I came from this is the

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,079
first project I worked on so I ended up

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,750
moving to a company called pivotal

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,180
that's where I'm at today and pivotal is

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,579
the opposite in some ways because it has

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,260
the inverse ambition it's starting out

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,019
with a huge collection of open source

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,109
projects and it's investing lots and

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,790
lots of money sponsored by emc and how

00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,159
can we build an open platform company

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,319
around these open source projects a lot

00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,569
of these projects are actually either

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,879
licensed or part of the apache

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,439
foundation so it's very special to be

00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,409
here today and participate with this

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,319
community and be close to this the whole

00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,389
event from Hadoop we're of course Roman

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,759
is here is Roman in the room and I

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,849
believe he mentioned there over six

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,009
talks today by pivotal people on Hadoop

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,780
and various other projects so Roman

00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:16,349
really leading our participation in

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,840
Apache the Apache world I'm just a kind

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:20,430
of an onlooker to some extent so really

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,049
go to Roman for the the latest and

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,969
greatest there but big investments to do

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,260
I'm closer to home for me is Apache

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:27,310
Tomcat and I'm going to talk a little

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,800
bit later in this about how this

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,240
cloud architectural shift is a really

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,470
huge opportunity for the lightweight

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,350
approach of Apache Tomcat in the

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,990
enterprise this shift to a scale-out

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,700
architecture is is a huge opportunity to

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,530
make that the enterprise standard and

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,930
then of course cloud foundry carries an

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,300
Apache to license in addition to many

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,730
other projects that we have so close to

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,750
home you know when open source started

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,220
out and this is kind of where open

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,830
solaris came from it was sort of like

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,150
just open sourcing the code was a big

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,740
thing like we kind of thought that the

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,080
magic would come from there and of

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,180
course we were wrong and today this is

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,220
just very very table stakes because it's

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,990
also a lot about the collaborative

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,550
community you build around it around the

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,290
community of users you have around it

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,660
and also aligning various people of

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,639
commercial interest in the code but the

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,350
one thing that we do standardize on our

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,880
cloud foundry project today and I'll

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,919
just share a little bit about you know

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,290
the project I work on and the lessons

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,510
learned there is the Apache you know

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,160
pachi to license this is also important

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,860
to our CLA I can't tell you how many

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,990
lawyers from various companies that want

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,820
to participate with us will try to send

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,470
me back a red line and I know this

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,600
sounds like a trivial thing that we use

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,280
the Apache License who cares but I've

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,810
been on so many calls with so many

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,650
vendors that want to work with us with

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,630
so many people who want to contribute

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,430
and as soon as you give a lawyer a

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,560
document the first thing they do is mark

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,660
it up it's like their job and they send

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,640
it back to you to negotiate and we have

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,050
said even to our parent company VMware I

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,840
had a call with them where I said nope

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,789
you cannot modify our CLA you don't get

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,620
to change anything it's the only way we

00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,479
can move forward together so this is a

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,130
really important asset that the

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,990
community has and thanks to Apache for

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,990
that it's at the bedrock of how we

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,789
invite people to our community the other

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,500
thing I've seen that I think is really

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,660
important is the second C code then

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,910
community is that you have to have a

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,979
strong base of users who are actually

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,660
pushing back and even the committers and

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,970
even people running the project I've

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,919
seen with various infrastructures of

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,690
service projects where there's been some

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,880
critique where there's not enough user

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,380
presence and user feedback and this is

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,300
something where Adrian from Spring has

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,500
taught me a lot because they've made

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,690
some mistakes with Spring Framework

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,400
along the way but because they had three

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,349
million Java developers that were using

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,420
this every day the feedback loop was

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:41,330
violent and immediate and so

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,520
in some sense i like to say that a large

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,230
robust active community is the greatest

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,030
governance model in some sense for

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,530
anyone who's writing software you know

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,750
it'd be a commercial proprietary

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,730
whatever have you that feedback loop of

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,460
this isn't working for me is really

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,260
vital and one of the curiosities they

00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,660
have that I'll share with the team with

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,450
the group here today is that in this

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,190
world of cloud consumption there's a new

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,450
way that developers start experiencing

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,850
things and they experience them as web

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,100
services and one of the existential

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,880
concerns I have for you know software in

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,770
general and sometimes I feel somewhat

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,270
nostalgic being a defender of software

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,520
because in this world there's this huge

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,350
push to just consume a service just grab

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,820
a service and go and i actually think

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,770
software is fundamentally important if

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,970
you go back you know to the beginning of

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,830
when you broke away from the mainframe

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,870
to the original unix programmers that

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,550
idea of a portable thing you could use

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,990
on any hardware was just so important

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,280
and is really given birth of the whole

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,430
industry where i've made a living my

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,120
entire life but at the same time we've

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,650
got you know strong push for the average

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,940
you know hacker news developer to go try

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,140
something as a service so we didn't

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,510
experience with cloud foundry where we

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,530
launch day one a hosting service that

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,930
people could just come in and use for

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,220
free and I wonder if in the future of

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,350
open software if there won't be a

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,330
foundation or maybe a patchy will do

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,010
this where hey some of the software is

00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,780
hosted on demand for people to consume

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,210
in a scalable way and a not-for-profit

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,470
way that might sound too altruistic but

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,120
it's something that bandied about with

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,860
IBM and others like hey could we create

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,150
a hosted sandbox for all of the software

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,380
collaboration is of course fundamentally

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,320
important to the success of any project

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,350
and this is where I think somewhat the

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,360
opensolaris project wasn't quite up to

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,040
snuff given the the pure body weight

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,300
ratio between almost a thousand

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,890
engineers working on the project that

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,540
day was open source than anyone who

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,520
wanted to come in and this is where

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,280
Apache has really created something very

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,920
special and thinking back the day I

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,200
started at level three was June of 1999

00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,810
and if I'm not mistaken I believe that's

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,640
the same date that Apache foundation was

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,240
founded and so I've sort of grown up in

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,100
an era where this whole idea of an open

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,450
playing field for collaboration became

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,180
that the normative behavior in the

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,300
industry one thing we've been

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,370
experimenting with is the idea that to

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,990
make it even easier for new developer to

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,240
come and work on a project we could

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,830
invite them into our office has anyone

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,390
ever done this where you've invited

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,980
someone literally who's new to the open

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,660
source community to your office to pair

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,270
program with you is this just something

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,970
people are trying we've seen it be very

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,010
successful because at at pivotal we come

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,480
from pivotal labs which has a pair

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,010
programming extreme programming

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,730
background in agile software development

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,470
and by inviting people to work with us

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,230
directly in a pair of programming model

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,730
we can speed up the ramp rate so IBM is

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,820
sent about eight or ten very talented

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,010
people through the program other people

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,330
are coming from SI p swiss column etc

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,400
and we're even experimenting with

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,750
customers about hey you want to get on

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,570
our roadmap you want to work with us

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,970
compare program with us and it's pretty

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,280
cool because within about four to six

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,990
weeks they can get an expert level

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,730
knowledge of a specific part of the code

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,100
because every day they're working for

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,900
you know 24 hour blocks with one of the

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,340
core programmers on the project so if

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,840
anyone wants to come and participate in

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,610
the open source Jojo I'd welcome that

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,200
and just in general I'm curious about

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,530
this model and how it can work for open

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,530
source communities so commerce is the

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,240
one thing that definitely has become a

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,170
big big part of the open-source

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,240
conversation in 1999 it was seen as and

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,880
I'll get into this a little bit later

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,550
somewhat of a you know cheaper than

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,220
hackers the light kind of part of the

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,950
community but today it is fundamentally

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,140
how most vendors do business so I don't

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,030
think it would have been possible to go

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,340
build a net new infrastructure software

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,350
company today the caters to developers

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,670
without having the leading or a leading

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,460
open source community around it and

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,470
we've also seen a huge influx of just

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,160
investment into the open source world

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,260
that is I think changed the game with

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,790
IBM you know they've been making some

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,010
big bets for a long time they made the

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,930
famous billion dollar bet on lenox and I

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,210
was again it was sort of an interesting

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,350
you know decade ago to look at this and

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,700
say hey they're going to bet a billion

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,320
dollars in this open source project

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,060
named cloud foundry I fundamentally

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,830
believe they would not have made that

00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,900
bet if it were not for it being an

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,940
Apache to license project like with

00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,230
without that foundation being there I

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,850
don't think there's any way that they

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,050
could have mustered the

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,600
natural resources that they're putting

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:12,079
into it today so things have definitely

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,380
changed it used to be open source vs.

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,970
proprietary for cost savings but now

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,589
we've moved into a world where any new

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,120
standard is fundamentally defined by the

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,569
leading open source project that

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,880
implements it it's a strategic access

00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:27,589
and finally I think it's winning because

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,970
it pulls people into its community

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,389
they're driven by a larger purpose

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,430
motive as a differentiator so started

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,380
with no one wants to be locked in and I

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,329
still deal with a lot of customers today

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,269
that are dealing with IBM websphere and

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,910
with oracle weblogic and they feel the

00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,350
pain and I just want to share with you

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,880
the look on their faces as a sit across

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,160
the table from you because it's so

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,930
palatable and I talked to this large

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,240
media company that looked at me and said

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,589
just for our division I owe 55 million

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,690
dollars and maintenance this year to

00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:00,649
Oracle for weblogic and he's just

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:03,230
looking at me like can you help please

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:05,420
and I think this is why the world

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,029
changed because there's such a bad taste

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,980
in everybody's mouth about the old style

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,990
of relationship which was will sell your

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,850
proprietary code that only we own and

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,230
dictate the terms for the rest of your

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,060
life as long as you want to use it of

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,889
how much it costs every year and of

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,910
course that's it that's a great place to

00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,509
start from and I think that really

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,130
catapulted the whole conversation but

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,529
the thing that's also happened is that

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,170
slingshot of momentum behind open source

00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,699
has given birth to the idea that open

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,769
source is also the new open standard and

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,569
what we didn't do when we wanted to

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,880
build an open platforms of services say

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:39,529
okay let's invite everyone into a room

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,939
to talk about the standard which we

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,339
would spec out together together for the

00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:44,750
next five years amazon certainly didn't

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:46,430
ask for permission to go build the

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,680
leading cloud they just implemented and

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,569
they went and I think the open standards

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,600
conversation is by and large turned into

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,009
the open open source conversation and

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,600
implemented running code is is the

00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,220
leadership position to be in and that's

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,350
a fundamental change again from a decade

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,139
ago thanks to the work of folks at

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,939
Apache and this has finally made

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,620
strategic open-source strategic to

00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:08,839
almost every company that's out there in

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,889
terms of how you consume it I had the

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,110
pleasure of meeting with one of the

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,430
largest banks in the world and they were

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,519
talking about their next generation

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,329
platform choices and it was amazing to

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,369
me how much they'd stocked and

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:22,709
paid attention to the community aspects

00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:24,660
of Cloud Foundry they came and said hey

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,730
we were on the last advisory board call

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,379
we heard what you were saying there we

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,209
liked the contributions coming in from

00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,739
this boutique consultancy and they were

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,649
really looking when they made a decision

00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:36,029
at that open source community behind the

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,399
product more than anything else and

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,199
that's what's made open source the game

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,540
in town for almost anyone who's starting

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:47,790
a company today so there was a black

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,069
duck survey I started these this in this

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,889
morning so Matt AC is anyone ever heard

00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:54,720
of him he's from 10gen and he does a lot

00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,879
of writing on readwriteweb about open

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,889
source and open source businesses and

00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,269
this actually drove home some of the

00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,589
observations I have had just from being

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,869
in the field every day and dealing with

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,799
it which is that in two thousand seven

00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:09,299
eighty percent of folks ranked sorry in

00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,100
two thousand seven eighty percent ranked

00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,329
costs as the primary driver for adopting

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,889
open source that's where that lock in

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,929
message came from nobody wanted lock in

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,389
they wanted to save money but today

00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:20,160
eighty percent of people rank quality as

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,749
the reason they're choosing open source

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,129
and this is really important to me

00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:25,169
because it gets to that idea that the

00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,059
best minds are participating in the open

00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,639
source projects well some people that

00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,869
might have a will we say sort of I work

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,059
for somebody and I do it because I have

00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:34,499
to mentality might be at the proprietary

00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,269
companies and I think that's become

00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,889
palatable in the economy the people know

00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:39,360
that the best minds are working an open

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,889
source and they turn to open source for

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,589
the best code quality that's really

00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,269
important the other thing is they said

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,339
that access to source code has gone up

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:50,339
in importance from fifty-seven percent

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,929
in 2007 to eighty percent today and this

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,160
gets back to that bank that you know

00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,290
wanted to work on the next generation

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,790
platform with us they really wanted to

00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,110
have their developers be able to be

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,239
hands-on to be part of that

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,040
collaboration in order to make that bet

00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,419
and that's again fundamentally

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,489
transformative from where we came today

00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,169
the final point is that they want to be

00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,059
able to attract and retain talent and I

00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:11,669
hear this time and time again which is

00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,869
that I can't retain talent if I don't

00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,149
have the leading open source

00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,290
technologies within my enterprise I just

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,919
can't do it people aren't going to come

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,029
work for me on you know Joe's Garage

00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,009
platform they want to be on the leading

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,389
open-source platform they want to be

00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,419
contributing they want to be a vibrant

00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,160
part of that conversation so this is

00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,749
Matt's quote about it and that what's

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,870
changed is that people actually want to

00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:33,550
get involved today they want to

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,870
see the code they want to understand it

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,610
on a quality level and they want to

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,930
contribute back and I think that's going

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,550
to be an interesting challenge we're

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,750
going to try to use this dojo approach

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,700
to invite even some of these

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,070
corporations to contribute but I have a

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,540
strong there's a problem still out there

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,250
with a lot of enterprise lawyers that

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,960
even people that are most committed to

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,790
this sometimes still have to commit

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,410
through cell shell companies so they'll

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,990
pay others to kind of funnel their code

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,460
into the project and you know whatever

00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,960
we can do is a community to start

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,700
educating enterprises now I think

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,630
vendors have all been educated but if

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,830
there's anything we can do around

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,910
enterprise outreach I think that's

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,650
really important because there's a lot

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,940
of talented people sitting in the

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,580
enterprise unable to contribute because

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,690
their concerns over IP from their legal

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,400
teams so this is the one I've been

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,770
hinting at a bit which is that I do

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,900
think purpose motive is fundamentally

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,060
why things like foundations things like

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,560
open source win out in the end and had

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,480
such a radical transformation in the

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,279
last ten years I know for me personally

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,080
there's any number of things I could be

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,640
doing working in the Bay Area there's

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,589
lots of job opportunities there today

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,120
but I've kind of tenacious Lee latched

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,710
on or the current project I've worked on

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,390
and anyone who sees me on Twitter will

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,520
know that I'm almost obsessed with it

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,470
and the reason I'm obsessed with it is

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,570
that I believe that software should

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,310
still exist in the cloud era at the end

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,360
of the day I believe that like I really

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,010
think that we shouldn't give up on

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
software that we shouldn't we should

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,800
still have a roni access throw an

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,240
infrastructure software if we want it we

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,130
shouldn't just be consuming cloud

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,930
services everywhere go and I think this

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,050
is the the fundamental reason why open

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,730
source has had such a big impact so once

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,850
you have you know all this going there's

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,410
different models for collaborating with

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,880
strategic open source we started on

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,199
github and I think that sent a good

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
signal immediately like hey we're ready

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,620
for a pull request come on in very

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,780
lightweight I know a lot of projects

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,470
start their lead into a apache

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,720
incubation etc we made the decision for

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,449
some unique reasons and because just the

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,370
size and scope of our project to form a

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,069
foundation of our own called the cloud

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,260
foundry foundation this is not something

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,490
that we did lightly and we considered

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,170
all the options but at the end of the

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,380
day we had a lot of vendor stakeholders

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,780
who really wanted to have an input and

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,880
wanted to be able to you know contribute

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,460
their own money to it fun conferences

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
and really come to the table also this

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,860
this happens sometimes where vendor

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,360
companies will drive the decisions

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,179
tops down so there's one particular

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,650
company that did not choose kind of from

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,640
grassroots developer up to join they

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,860
joined from the president of the company

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,120
down and they wanted to join that way so

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,100
it's very interesting to me seeing these

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,990
different models that have emerged for

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,660
collaboration we've partnered with these

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,120
companies so far so far we have a

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,980
platinum level which is they contribute

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,720
five hundred thousand dollars a year to

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,400
the cloud foundry foundation there's

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,110
eight people have signed up at the

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,179
platinum level we've also formed a gold

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,799
level and we'll forming a silver level

00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,990
there's some pretty big names here and

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,910
what most excites me about this is by by

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,830
joining they really are giving the ok to

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,290
their product departments to say go

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,150
invest in this make a big bet on it and

00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,919
I think that's really important because

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,169
it signals the start of a race of these

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,870
companies so now Verizon has said this

00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,130
is the passive choice for us SI p had

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,840
their own background building their own

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,549
proprietary paths but now it's kind of

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,140
come top down like hey let's move

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,880
forward and collaborate send people to

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,770
dojo let's join us open source project

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,730
so i think it's it's a fundamentally

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:49,520
important and a landmark moment for four

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,110
platforms of service so i mentioned this

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,700
before my purpose motors for cloud

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,440
foundry and i'll finish the talk talking

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,850
a little bit about how our architecture

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,850
enables this it's not so much a product

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,650
pitch as it the idea that what's

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,940
possible with open-source software on

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,590
top of the infrastructure service

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,790
because i believe at the end of the day

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,860
that the infrastructure service should

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,480
be a server to us it really should it be

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,429
this full stack of things that does

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,340
everything for us and we deposit a tiny

00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:15,169
bit of configuration on top there's also

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,540
a great quote from dr. Nick who's one of

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:19,580
these just purpose motive guys he is

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,710
this great staying he says he's like

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,330
we're all here to serve he says we're

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,460
here to provide service to everybody

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,720
else that's why we're alive and dr. Nix

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,669
really inspirational he's the number one

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,370
contributor in our open source our

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:32,870
mailing list and he is this great talk

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,370
where he goes everybody deserves nice

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,350
things and he's got this really funny

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,809
Australian accent is I everybody does

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,610
that have nice things and it's great

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,980
when you hear it but what he means is

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,840
that there's a lot of great new startups

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,250
out there using cloud services and using

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,020
the latest and greatest but we need to

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,120
bring the stack to the enterprise to

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,130
everybody as well and that everybody

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,030
should have cloud services and be able

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,030
to participate with them

00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:00,309
so I don't know today we see this google

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,980
cloud announcement you see this come out

00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,720
i thought it was pretty interesting they

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,549
really really reduce the concentration

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,259
gradient now getting it a little bit in

00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,330
topaz and talking about pass a bit

00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:13,450
they'd reduce the concentration gradient

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,399
between a raw I as and a their app

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,619
engine which was one of the first passes

00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,999
that ever ever launched and it used to

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:20,859
be that you could either go App Engine

00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:22,480
you go I as and what they did is they

00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,980
used the idea of a declarative

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,169
deployments where they did health

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,669
checking on those declare deployments we

00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:30,039
also have the same approach so there's

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:32,259
really two layers that we have you click

00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,659
through again where you can have a fully

00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:36,070
managed run time in the future you'll be

00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:38,409
able to just push a docker file we've

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,830
got some contributions out there that

00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:42,909
enable that or you also can deploy

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,139
wholesale clusters in a very declarative

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,359
way I'm going to give you a quick demo

00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:48,879
of that in a second and this really

00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,919
changes the debate about what's an eye

00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:52,749
as whatsapp as because you can step up

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,639
along the way if you just want to

00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:56,259
managed OS and login for that and health

00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:59,200
management for that you can do that for

00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:01,119
say a database or a more stateful thing

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,230
or if you want to fully manage runtime

00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,830
that's more stateless you can graduate

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:08,019
to a full-fledged pass so this is the

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,109
the lightweight architectural diagram of

00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:14,039
what Cloud Foundry is today we support

00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:16,809
multiple infrastructures of service so

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,299
CloudStack support was donated by ntt

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,619
and a university from china again you

00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,850
there's no predicting where these things

00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,049
will come from and it was great to see

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,580
that coming organically from the

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,259
community i would say there's been a

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,480
great resurgence in cloudstack actually

00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:31,149
over the last six months sky over in

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,519
britain is working on cloudstack with

00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,409
cloud foundry on top of it and you know

00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,690
it's great to see this coming up NTT is

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:39,009
also also doing that but at the end of

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,499
the day this is similar to that Google

00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:43,389
architecture in accept that we are I as

00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:45,190
independent so you can deploy these

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,929
clusters in a very declarative way and

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,090
i'll show you a demo of that or you can

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,679
consume an elastic runtime service which

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,970
is a managed runtime that's highly

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,950
scalable and i'll talk a little bit

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,200
about that in the future and my call to

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,210
action here is that this can be a common

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,210
framework for deploying other data

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,929
services and other cloud services across

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,929
the open source community

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:11,010
so this is a little bit unfair because

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,690
Amazon Beanstalk is not like the most

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,580
robust platforms of service enabling

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,350
technology in the world but I wanted to

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,570
point out that there's no reason that

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,310
just raw software can't compete with

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,950
these cloud services offered by these

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,020
infrastructure service vendors so you

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,640
just did a quick bake-off you know we

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,380
can use lightweight containers you know

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,090
I heard Stratus this is very popular to

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,640
use containers today I think that's

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,710
where everything is headed instead

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,840
amazon Beanstalk its legacy it came out

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,880
you know five or six years ago uses a

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,560
heavy vm overhead so that means that if

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,090
you want to deposit a 500 megabyte

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,250
application you might have to put it

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,480
into a 1.7 gigabyte container and you

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,130
can all just see where the waste comes

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,720
from there as you scale out the second

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,370
thing is you have to wait for a vm to be

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,110
created versus a container container

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,180
beacon graded in you know half a second

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:57,180
and a vm of course has old number of

00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,910
things to start up and get going with we

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,320
are very into 12 factor app compliance

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,790
have folks heard of 12 factor

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,430
applications that people think about

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,530
this in their architectures so not too

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,360
many it's the idea that your app

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,500
configuration or your configuration for

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,660
running your application should be

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,860
external to the application so the

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,300
platform should deposit the

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,560
configuration code in usually in an

00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,200
environment variable on the file system

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,480
whereas Beanstalk uses some in app

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,500
configuration files built-in logging is

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,910
very important the whole idea of this

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,620
platform as a service and even the

00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,300
Google cloud where they talked about the

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,140
managed VM the idea that soon as you

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,300
deploy something you should get

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,190
streaming logs just for that set of

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,660
applications or that user immediately

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,490
from all aspects of the platform is an

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,050
important thing that that we do that

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,760
does not come for Amazon Bienstock today

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,770
the final thing I'll mention is that

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,660
when you go to do Bluegreen deployment

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,640
so you go to do code updates and switch

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,260
things over they suggest that you do DNS

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,840
changes which of course have propagation

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,390
latency and we do instantaneous cutover

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,900
on our own internal load balancer

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:56,460
finally there amazon owing this is you

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,020
know maybe the most interesting part of

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,150
the commercial conversations i'm having

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,410
and i think this is truly a a profound

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,990
moment in the history of enterprise

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,630
middle where it used to be that you

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:10,020
wanted a vertically scaled clustered

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,760
approach to doing middleware or runtime

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,260
containers what's happened is that the

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,850
cloud has changed that folks like

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,010
netflix have used apache tomcat for

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,720
scale out architectures we're in order

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,110
to get resiliency you scale out in order

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,480
to get skin

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,920
ability you also scale out and all the

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,540
factors I've talked about before that it

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,510
made open source front of mine for

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,520
enterprises today have led to the idea

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,350
that when we talk to folks they view

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,330
Cloud Foundry as like the leading

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,980
solution they don't view us as the

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,150
inexpensive thing to oracle they don't

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,830
even want to have that conversation as

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,360
much as they hate it they really see us

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,000
as the vanguard of the next generation

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,030
architectures and it's my posit that

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,770
this next 10 years will be dominated in

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,179
the enterprise by open-source middleware

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,290
and a way that the last 10 that they

00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,480
were locked into the old architecture

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,640
won't be and I think that's huge because

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,530
it always was we were sort of competing

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,210
with tomcat by itself as a cheaper

00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,320
container and now we've implemented in

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,090
an architecture we can really be

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,950
aggressive about this is your cloud

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,440
platform and folks are really paying

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,450
attention to it more than before I can't

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,590
tell you enough that everybody wants it

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,090
so when I talk to them it's just a

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,890
matter of how do they migrate to it like

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,030
I've not had a meeting with folks that

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,110
are running Enterprise middleware today

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,520
they said this sounds like a horrible

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,840
thing to have a platform the

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,580
automatically scale deploy and manage

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,110
everything I'm doing like no one comes

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,760
away from that meeting the question is

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,470
like how do they unbind themselves and

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,880
decisions that made before and that's

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,510
the challenge we have but I think the

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,160
future is very very bright so i'm going

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,080
to show you then that's the elastic run

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,490
time management part of our platform but

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,080
we also have this declarative cluster

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,660
deployment that i'm pretty excited about

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,299
as well and in this case we've taken

00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,890
something like Apache Hadoop and we're

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:46,049
building a cluster on Google compute

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:49,290
engine in about three minutes and what

00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:52,770
you'll see here when it starts up this

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:54,510
is the tool Cloud Foundry Bosh and

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,850
you'll see that it's CPI this is the

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,669
cloud provider interface is set for

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,350
Google compute engine and you're now

00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,630
going to do a Bosch deploy this is this

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,250
declarative cluster deployment now

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,040
there's a manifest that describes every

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,929
bit every bit of state that the probe

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,419
that the platform wants to see now come

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:15,570
into life on Google the first minute and

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,390
25 of this is we're automating the

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,270
creation of all the VMS necessary on GCE

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,740
you could probably cut about 40 seconds

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,840
out of this except right now Google is

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,610
throttling its API so it'll let us

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,190
create a bunch of VMs quickly and then

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,630
it slows us down for a bit at the end of

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,460
the day we could probably do this in

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,380
about 32 seconds which is

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,730
how long it takes to start VMs on Google

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,230
it's about two and a half times faster

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,260
than Amazon if you guys have never used

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,790
it so the VMS that are necessary for the

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,850
cluster will start up completely

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,200
automated in about a minute 25 and the

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,240
next thing you'll see is that it'll

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,130
start those VMs it will deposit an agent

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,750
on them and that agent sits on a

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,400
standardized operating system so

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,930
everything about the platform is really

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
appliance like that standardized

00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,830
operating system then we'll pull down

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,360
all the packages necessary and layer

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,550
every process that needs to start the

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,920
cluster the thing I'll mention here is

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,210
is that this is again we're open source

00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,160
is very important to us because our

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,540
cluster deployment tools we really like

00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,670
to build from source ourselves every

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,410
time we don't like to take a lot of

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,550
pre-compiled things we don't like things

00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,830
that are already laid out in a specific

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,450
way in a file system we like access to

00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,250
source code and it might not be possible

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,480
to do this engine in a different world

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,240
where we really were dealing with things

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,220
like SI p and oracle etc so now what's

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,620
happening is it's binding the agent to

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,390
those VMs and they're all joining and

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,340
the role that their specified and you'll

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,400
see various services here like ganglia

00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,400
and other Hadoop Hadoop stack services

00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,110
being started up so at the end of the

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,550
day it takes about three minutes now

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:44,790
it's all starting up you can see the

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,200
slaves HDFS name node ganglia we put a

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,210
little monitoring into this the other

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,190
day you get a Hadoop cluster of about 10

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,840
nodes we can do it up to 200 in three

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,160
minutes and the thing that was exciting

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,810
about this for me and my purpose motive

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,930
is that Google wrote us they said how

00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:00,240
did you do that their previous demo on

00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,340
GCE was 10 minutes using their own

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,830
tooling and it was pretty cool to have

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,510
like one of the most powerful

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,830
unbelievably talented you know companies

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,720
in the world that has so much

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,430
engineering power come to us and say hey

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,930
I'll G do that on a cloud and they want

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,130
to advertise this a bit so we'll poke

00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,580
around here and you'll see that we're

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,900
not faking it it will touch it a couple

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,760
different parts of the cluster here this

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,920
is ganglia and then the log into the

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,150
name node etc the thing is is that we

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,830
also then show this to the Apache

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,600
Cassandra folks and they said how'd you

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,430
do that that's really fast you know we

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,830
don't do you know 800 node clusters that

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,300
quickly on GC or any is and so we're

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,130
working with them to build cassandra as

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,290
a service using the same technology and

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,820
my call to action is anyone who wants to

00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,980
work together with us on building a

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,630
rapidly deployed rapidly updated health

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,190
monitored you know scalable cloud

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,020
service together with this tech be

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:51,900
welcome to have that conversation and

00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:53,580
yeah we could work together so next

00:28:51,900 --> 00:29:00,000
slide that'll let me get out of the

00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:01,620
video again maybe unfair but just to

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,380
bake us off against the the cutting edge

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,700
and in you know amazon which is sort of

00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,650
one of the early cloud leaders a good

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,280
benchmark to have it takes them about

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,390
seven minutes to start an EMR cluster

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,680
we're about two and a half times faster

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,660
the other thing we can do is we can then

00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,980
double the size of it so it keeps track

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,690
of you know how big the cluster is what

00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,340
expected state where you want to go and

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,750
you can double the size then and about

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,700
the same time I think there's lots of

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,500
things we can do here and I think we can

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,060
start to bring the time down to under

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,650
two minutes as VM creation time gets

00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,030
even faster and you start to give

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,710
developers access to have whatever

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,360
configuration they want on tens of

00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,980
thousands of machines almost

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,480
instantaneously I think that's a

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,820
transformative moment and developer

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:44,430
productivity in the cloud era so I'll

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,630
finish up here pretty quickly when we

00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,860
bring this together we talk about our

00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,080
value prop and again this isn't really a

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,610
cloud foundry pitch more of just an

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,200
overview of what we're working on how

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,880
we're thinking about it but the idea

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,130
that you can push an application in a

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,780
very simple way to a platform as a

00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,460
service you can then get all these

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,570
built-in operational features that you

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,030
don't have to worry about your running

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,650
code the logging is there the ID the

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,510
permission access control it's all there

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,400
for you and then get it very large

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,810
ecosystem of attached data services to

00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,130
it that don't just run in single

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,840
containers or single knows but can

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,700
really be very large very robust

00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,310
clusters so this time around just to

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,230
wrap up I think maybe there's some

00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,610
better signs of life and the project I'm

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,680
working on today at least I hope so and

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,930
you know we started from the start we

00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,910
started very early open sourcing it as

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,830
soon as we had working code it was out

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,300
on github and we also started with this

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,620
hosted version but so people could

00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,100
experience it very rapidly to try to

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,320
build a community the difference this

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,870
time is the Palmer it suits our CEO

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,730
pardon me x CEO of vmware when he talked

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,680
about you know self interest in what the

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,270
idea behind this was he actually quoted

00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,770
in Wired and saying hey this is a leap

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,390
of faith for us we're going to build the

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,070
largest possible community around this

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,150
and hopefully a business after that so

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,710
that's very different from that old

00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,880
quote where i said hey this only exists

00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,650
for our self-interest i feel much better

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,060
about that finally in collaboration

00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,670
working with you know patchy group

00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,800
patchy foundation the various projects

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,050
within it with our github approach dojo

00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,340
community pairs we are all out focused

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,740
on collaboration that's why we're here

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,440
today so I think things are looking much

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,390
brighter and this really fits into the

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,280
overall arc what we've seen a change in

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,070
the open source economy where we've gone

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,270
from cost savings based cheaper

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,860
approaches where the enterprise has

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,780
really woken up to the idea that purpose

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,670
motive is important to software and that

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,980
the place to get the best software are

00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,720
the highly collaborative organizations

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,040
that are promoting that today so that's

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,190
my quick chat it was thanks for having

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,190
