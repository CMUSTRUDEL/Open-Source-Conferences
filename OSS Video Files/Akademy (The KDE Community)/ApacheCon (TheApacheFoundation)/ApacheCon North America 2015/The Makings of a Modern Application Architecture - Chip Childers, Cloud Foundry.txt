so what I want to talk to you today

00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,649
about is not so much about our

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,730
technology or about the boundary

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,440
foundation but it's actually about the

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,929
problem space that we're working to

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,460
solve so rich introduced me so I can

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,480
skip the part that says it hi I'm a

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,660
Apache member and I do have a long

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,060
history working in an interesting

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,279
variety of spaces right so I started my

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,869
career doing web development high up the

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,609
stack dealing as close to the users as

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,840
possible and then through the course of

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,180
their career I kind of dropped way down

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,730
into infrastructure automation the

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,989
Apache project that I'm involved with is

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:45,420
Apache CloudStack and so I've seen a

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,340
variety of needs within the different

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,200
layers of the stack and what that's

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,879
really kind of given me perspective on

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
is the fact that we've moved into a

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,899
world where it's very apparent that

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
every company has to transition

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,930
themselves into being some type of

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,309
software company you know Marc

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,989
Andreessen says software seeding the

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,760
world that's kind of interview statement

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,510
right now but it is very very important

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,680
and we we titled the talk originally the

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,479
making of a modern application

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,220
architecture but but as we explore the

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,200
problem we realized that you know the

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,250
right way to describe this is that what

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,049
we're talking about is a cloud native

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,880
application platform we are at a dawn of

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,409
a new era we like to joke especially

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,900
within the cloud foundry community that

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,530
this is day one of a you know very long

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,670
journey that we're going to go through

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,500
software and technology is becoming

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,329
increasingly important to everyone's

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,060
lives you know the phones that we all

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,530
carry you know these things have

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,420
exponentially more computing power more

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,310
connectivity than what entire

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,530
corporations had available to them you

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,240
know just a few years ago and that's

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,110
changing the way that people actually

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,939
interact with each other with it with

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,890
their businesses where their customers

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,799
you know with the companies that they do

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,469
business with and that is it is really

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,320
really something that's important to

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,799
understand for how companies interact

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,110
with you as individuals so all this

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,140
change in the way people interact leads

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,370
us to what is really a shift in what

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,770
businesses need to do they need to

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,530
change to match this human behavior they

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,730
need to actually understand how to

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,730
support the technology that's needed

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:32,910
we're very connected aren't we so for

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,070
about 20 years MIT Sloan School of

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,900
Business Management has been saying that

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,260
the way that businesses are successful

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,810
is that they have to create a

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,700
sustainable competitive advantage right

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,100
this has been the way that business you

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,630
know nba's have spoken about strategy

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,489
it's the way that boardrooms have

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,530
thought about forming corporations what

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,800
the right product moves are but you know

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,080
what MIT doesn't say that anymore it's

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,720
actually not possible to create

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,239
sustainable competitive advantage in

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,470
today's market and so that puts you in a

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,730
position where you actually need to

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,340
approach things by thinking about

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,350
continuous innovation because if you

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,150
have an advantage if you're doing well

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,530
on a particular market it's very likely

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,640
that markets going to shift around you

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,350
and that's because of the technology

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,549
enablement that's happening across all

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,799
the industries so we've seen a rise of

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,570
agile development now this is this is an

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,420
open source conference most of us are

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:31,079
involved in Apache but how many of you

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,880
today perhaps in your day jobs work

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,010
through some type of agile methodology

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,299
you raise your hand oh it's a good

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,510
number right all right keep your hands

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,070
up keep your hands up all right now

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,019
listen carefully for all of you they

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,610
have your hands up you only get to keep

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,650
them up if you're also doing continuous

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,750
delivery so everybody doesn't do

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,970
continuous delivery drop your hands ok

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,829
that's the overwhelming majority

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,510
interesting right so what that's setting

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,940
you up to do is basically water scrum

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,140
fall right is that you know is that what

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,120
actually delivers value to the business

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,820
you're doing a great job going from

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,650
design to demo and that business partner

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,810
loves you but you're not achieving the

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,370
goals that you're trying to achieve so

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,590
how do we get out of this water from

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,329
fall problem well our perspective is

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,190
that you need to be able to pair the

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,989
notion of a cloud native application

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,519
architecture with this continuous

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,079
delivery business value right these are

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,789
two very discreet things but they're

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,840
very important and you put these two

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,210
together and you get

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,500
environment that allows for continuous

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,030
innovation so we know open source

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,889
matters here right this is a splattering

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,510
of logos some Apache projects some not

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,479
some single vendor open source some

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,900
foundation projects but what we've seen

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,000
in the market is that today's markets

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,949
are pressuring companies to collaborate

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,510
with each other whether we're talking

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,090
about the Apache way or whether we're

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,010
talking about foundations that are more

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,650
industry consortiums this need to

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,470
collaborate to solve common problems is

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,940
really critical and then what we're

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,870
using you know what the enterprises are

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,720
doing is they're starting to put

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,889
together stacks stacks that are open

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,780
from bottom to top whether you're

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,639
talking about down lowest level things

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,690
like the Open Compute Project how its

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,220
hardware being designed in a

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,660
collaborative way all the way up through

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,229
the language frameworks that we wrote

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,610
our applications in the challenge for us

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,250
is an industry is to figure out how we

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,110
get cohesion up and down the stack so

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,100
that we can actually solve the problem

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,930
of continuous innovation now if you want

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,700
to do continuous innovation today's

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,050
evolutionary architecture the latest

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,440
evolution and architecture is really

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,660
microservices it's not a revolution but

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,100
it's an evolution towards a design

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,150
pattern that lets us be very flexible

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,099
that lets us innovate rapidly Martin

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,500
Fowler has done a lot of work thinking

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,560
about continuous I'm sorry about micro

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,840
services and he's laid out really for

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,180
kind of emergent requirements that have

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,070
to exist in order to deliver this type

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,960
of architecture we know that we need

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,360
rapid provisioning of underlying

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,229
capabilities that's absolutely required

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,419
we have an assumption of operability

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,800
right so basic monitoring's listed there

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,570
that's the way Martin describes if I

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,950
kind of broaden that a little bit you

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,900
have to assume that when you deploy

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,490
something it's going to be operable all

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,650
the day two operations are being handled

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,910
for you and there's there's other

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,120
requirements in there as well including

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,260
culture the actually I've slipped back

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,180
to that so there's rapid application

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,660
deployment but the DevOps cultures is

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,970
the people and people are really what

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,349
make this work and the DevOps movement

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,919
is showing us that you need to be able

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:33,600
to create cycle of innovation cycle of

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,740
feedback loops

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,280
that's how you iterate that's how you

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,310
continue to do that innovation now when

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,040
all this market pressure creates the

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,230
need to solve these problems you end up

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,560
with a lot of solutions being developed

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:53,250
right we have containers with docker a

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,010
rocket now certainly these technologies

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,630
are focused on how do you make the

00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,820
result of an application development

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,180
process deployable you know what's the

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,920
right artifact of the resulting work you

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,320
have automation around a puppet chef

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,910
tangible saltstack and then we have the

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,870
problem of data center scale cluster

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,250
management with mezzos goober Nettie's

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,200
each of these projects are really good

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,210
at what they do and they solve a part of

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,860
the bigger problem now our perspective

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,300
again is that what we need is a cloud

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,280
native application platform that kind of

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,770
unifies all these concepts takes

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,500
advantage of the work going on at lower

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,000
layers of the stack and supports all the

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,330
work that can occur at the upper layers

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,950
the language frameworks the runtimes we

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,750
believe Cloud Foundry is a cloud native

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,890
application platform might not be the

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:43,650
only one but it's certainly one so what

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,000
is cloud foundry at its heart cloud

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,340
foundry is a place of practice for

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,780
continuous innovation now you notice

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,460
that I'm not talking about a software

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,650
system here what I'm actually talking

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,350
about if we break this down is that we

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,830
see cloud foundry as a noun right it's a

00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:02,760
proper noun a foundry is a place where

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,950
we produce goods real goods that are

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,540
used for some purpose and a cloud

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,730
foundry is a place where those goods are

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,860
actually the software artifacts that our

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,290
companies need and then a place of

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,600
practice the way that you go from being

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,940
a bricklayer to a cathedral builder is

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,800
that you practice and that the community

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,610
shares best practices for how they're

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,440
delivering their software on how they're

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,790
learning to iterate together and so that

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,450
place of practice is really key as well

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,410
and that gets you continuous innovation

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,510
so now I'll talk quickly about our

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,719
project just in terms of the technology

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,310
stack let's look at the top end users

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
and users have a lot of different

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,910
devices this is their the real reason

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,400
why we do all the software that we do

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,110
I've spoken with cloth sack conferences

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,310
and I've reminded everyone there that

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,110
infrastructure as a service

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,150
right why are we doing what we're doing

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,710
we're doing it because of the end users

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,300
and the value that get out of the

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,910
software in the end you can't lose sight

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,070
of that down at the lower layer is where

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,750
there's a lot of different option ality

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,029
around what infrastructure we're going

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,830
to consume and for cloud foundry we need

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,510
to be able to support all the various

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,279
public cloud providers that are out

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,330
there private cloud software packages

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,880
that are out there and then really the

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,050
gooey middle is where we exist so we

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,820
have three components the elastic

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,680
runtime this is where the applications

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,339
live they're generally treated as

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,650
ephemeral we have the services these are

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,930
the persistent state services that you

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,450
need for your application applications

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,560
generate data data has to go somewhere

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,130
so this is where we have a lot of

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,660
integration with Apache projects so if

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,920
you're running a Hadoop cluster we see

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,360
that as a service if you're running a

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,190
cassandra cluster we see that as a

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,320
service that's how we integrate with

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,930
with a lot of the big data suite here at

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,220
apache and then we have this operations

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,940
layer because all of this is you know

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,290
fantastic for an application developer

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,170
but you need to be able to actually

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,830
manage the environment deploy it log it

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:01,550
operate it what we're working on right

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,380
now within the project two key things

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:08,460
we're refactoring that elastic runtime

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,230
that project is called diego today or

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,980
elastic runtime focuses on build packs

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,140
build packs or a Heroku concept but

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,240
we've adopted it we're also implementing

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,690
support for docker and rocket and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,760
potentially other other frameworks the

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,260
other thing we've done is we've said we

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,420
don't have to be a data center scale

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,380
solution what we want to be is actually

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,690
a solution that of course manages a data

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,459
center scale but we have now something

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,920
called lattice which can run on a laptop

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,230
or be deployed out on Amazon via

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:47,640
terraform to quickly create elastic

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:50,310
runtime clusters so in closing this is

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,279
why I took this job because we actually

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,580
really do see a world of computing

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,620
that's ubiquitous flexible it's portable

00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,760
interoperable and then vibrant and

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,080
growing ecosystem and to us the

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,740
ecosystems really important

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,020
he is a key part of that ecosystem and

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,330
with that thank you very much we

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,330
