it is an honor and a privilege to be

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,259
here with you this morning and spend

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,660
some time I'm extremely excited to get

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,599
the opportunity to to speak with some of

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,780
the most influential people in the

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,630
openness movement and the openness open

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,210
source community just to give you the

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,029
context of myself spent about 10 years

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,760
doing custom software development

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:29,070
working as a consultant for many of the

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,019
fortune 500 companies doing kindle

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,030
custom line of business development but

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,760
at Microsoft for over 12 years now I

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,010
started as a program manager on the

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,770
visual basic.net team responsible for

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,059
the editor and debugger and today I had

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,640
the opportunity to lead the program

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,850
management team responsible for the.net

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,289
runtime the.net base class libraries the

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,360
managed programming languages that we

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,480
develop so C sharp F sharp visual

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,129
basic.net as well as all of our tools

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,449
inside of Visual Studio for building

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,280
those kinds of applications but also

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,080
building and deploying applications to

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,750
the cloud and I have to admit in my 22

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,689
plus years I didn't actually think I'd

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,049
ever be standing on a stage under the

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,970
feather right that's pretty cool

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,490
especially not as someone from Microsoft

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,689
so you know in those 22 years i will say

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,420
that i've had the opportunity to see

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,650
just a dramatic amount of change change

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,780
in the industry change in the way

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,880
enterprises think about and work with

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,250
open source and most importantly in the

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,409
last 12 years change in the way we build

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,630
software and the way we think about

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,790
engaging with communities engaging with

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,920
open source inside of Microsoft itself

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,070
and before us getting too far into this

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,090
I do want to take the opportunity to do

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,950
a +1 from myself and for Microsoft and

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,049
saying congratulations to the apache

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,430
software foundation on 15 years

00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,770
congratulations to the web server

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,759
project on 20 years and the amazing

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,890
amount of innovation and change that

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,349
those two things combined have

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,540
contributed and affected in the software

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,069
industry I'd actually say that the

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,219
proclamation yesterday by the City of

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,349
Austin of three days of being you know

00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,560
Apache days that's that's another

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,890
testament to just the immense amount of

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,879
impact as an organization you've had so

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,879
congratulations and thank you for that

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,519
now what I'd like to do is spend some

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,950
spend are times when you talk a little

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,049
bit about just sort of you know how we

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,269
have gone and involved as a company

00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,489
turns out that microsoft also has just

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,769
celebrated an anniversary early this

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,569
month represented forty years as an

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,359
organization where we started out with

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,790
this mission of putting a PC on every

00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,180
desk in every house right it was a bold

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,500
mission at that time and really it

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,739
represented the need and the desire to

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,689
not just put hardware and software in

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,359
front of people but to be able to use

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:12,389
that to facilitate interaction

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:14,750
communication and thus innovation and

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,659
improvements in efficiency for everybody

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,989
whether it's a consumer at home or a

00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:23,400
business organization at work obviously

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,310
that was we've been fairly successful

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,379
with that and now it's really a matter

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,340
of kind of evolving and moving from this

00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:34,739
PC revolution to an openness revolution

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:39,209
alright that's fair better late than

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,579
never I get it we're a little behind but

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,530
that really is what we're about now it

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,329
really is you know the fact that this

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,459
openness revolution is really grounded

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:50,609
in those principles of open source and

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,680
open standards and that that is what's

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,530
going to foster innovation over time and

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,659
its core to our success as a software

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,239
organization and any company that

00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,829
strives to be successful in that space

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,379
the last couple years last year really

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:06,120
has shown a lot of acceleration in those

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,509
changes we have a new CEO who is

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,060
aggressively pushing our open cloud and

00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,000
our open company initiatives and I think

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,949
that's great and of course you know we

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,169
talked about you'll hear me say that the

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,180
mobile-first cloud-first world you know

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,490
that is a real thing to us and that

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,710
really is at its core

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,569
what's sparking us to understand and

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,270
embrace openness and the fact that that

00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:34,080
is the only way we can be successful

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,490
with that kind of a mission just to give

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,690
you a little bit of a sense of how

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,550
things have changed i mean there are a

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,430
number of things that never quite

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,259
thought i would expect to see like

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,539
microsoft partnering with you know

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,539
google and mozilla i'm defining the

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:51,630
future of the open web Microsoft

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:54,599
engineers contributing significant code

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,099
20 plus thousand lines of code into the

00:04:54,599 --> 00:05:02,099
Linux kernel Microsoft employees as

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:04,139
committers and PMC chairs of software

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,180
projects in the apache software

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,889
foundation those are all things that

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,190
that have happened in the last couple

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,960
years that really I think go to the the

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,699
importance and the strategic need and

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,069
the long-term bat that we as a company

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:22,440
are finally waking up to you and pray n

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:26,630
and acknowledging around open source did

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,630
you too Hey look at that wrong way

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,950
the first one second step back let me

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,970
give you a little bit of context this

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,370
isn't something that just happened in

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,840
the last 12-18 months as a company we've

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,070
actually been on this journey for about

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,620
10 years started back in 2004 we had a

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,330
project that was actually sort of done

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,830
as an open-source effort internally it

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,970
was called the Wix project just a

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:54,700
windows installer xml based technology

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,410
that was not owned by any specific team

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,090
inside the company it was something that

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,210
a number of folks came together and

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,070
started developing and was used by a

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,070
number of product teams across the

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,120
organization after a little bit time you

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,040
know and by the way the poll thing was

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,210
done on their spare time they weren't

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,390
even really doing it as part of their

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,860
core their core job function they

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,320
realized this was a great opportunity to

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,180
go and actually you know it's do our

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,180
first foray into a public open source

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,520
project so in 2004 we made that project

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,100
available its continues to be an

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,650
important part of our internal product

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,120
development is what we use to create our

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,160
installer packages it's a core part of

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,930
the visual studio product both for use

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,800
of ourselves as well as making it

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,390
available to customers to develop with

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,840
I'd say you know that that sort of

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,820
started the wave in 2005 we created the

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,980
f-sharp programming language danse I'm

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,380
one of our principal researchers was the

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,740
designer and architect of that language

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,330
and it started out as a completely open

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,840
project and today still is one of the

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,090
most popular open source projects that

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,570
we as a company have or have had for a

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,980
long period of time along the way you

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,350
know we started getting involved in a

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,470
number of other interesting projects I'd

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,450
say you know 2007 you know Microsoft and

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,540
samba coming to an agreement with a

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,190
pretty significant milestone I mentioned

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,920
before the contribution of code to the

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,350
Linux kernel was another big step in

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,440
that direction number of projects since

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,670
then let's say back you know since you

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,130
know and we just continue to accelerate

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,740
today there's over 2,000 projects on

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,630
just github and complex alone that are

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,080
Microsoft projects and that's only a

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,390
small set of the overall interactions

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,880
and work that we do

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:50,830
with the open source community can I go

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,910
backwards again of course I did so let's

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,130
talk a little bit about one of the

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,630
important things is that while we may

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,300
have been a little bit late to the game

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,610
here we have also taken the opportunity

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,560
to really learn from the people on the

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,390
floor front we've learned from and look

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,220
at how I think it's interesting to see

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,990
how the you know the Apache way has

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,430
really influenced the way we as an

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,230
organization embrace open source you

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,030
know it's not just about you know

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,460
contributing to you and open sourcing

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,670
our projects there's a lot more involved

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,460
back you know previously the idea was if

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,720
your code was open you were open that

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,340
was it it was black and white you were

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,800
either open or not there wasn't much

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,170
more involved in it back then also pcs

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,880
came with floppy disks and modems Jack's

00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,930
right today when we think about openness

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,640
and we think about the openness of

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,760
revolution there are really four key

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,560
components for key ingredients to that

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,810
obviously open source the code being

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,030
open is part of it you know the apache

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,010
software foundation being that the

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,290
oldest open-source software foundation

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,660
is clearly you know paved the way for

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,980
the how to go and do that how to create

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,570
and manage those kinds of things open

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,410
standards is another key aspect of this

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,660
right the the most of the work that we

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,730
do developing software systems is really

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,790
about ensuring and enabling them to

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,110
interact with each other if we had to do

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,100
that as developers by going and just

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,360
looking at code we could do it but it's

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,250
not the optimal way to make it happen

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,350
you really need consistent set of

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,690
standards agreed upon across the

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,940
protocols and across these ap is and

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,470
while not a standards board or standards

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,280
organization the apache software

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,900
foundation clearly with its approach to

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,340
encouraging and fostering development

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,170
around these standards and pushing these

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,790
standards has had a big influence there

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:45,970
as well the third component is the

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:48,070
individuals themselves the people in the

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,710
software space it really is the

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,410
developers that determine the winners

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,240
and losers

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,670
in a space that they're the kingmakers

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,259
they are the ones that decide which

00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,769
projects which technologies are going to

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:03,589
to really move forward and be successful

00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:05,089
the you know the the influence the focus

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,800
and you know the mantra of the Apache

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,259
way around focusing on the community

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,480
create a great community and high

00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:16,009
quality colored will follow is really

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,050
what i think is a great vision a great

00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:19,610
way of demonstrating the importance of

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,220
people and the importance of developers

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:27,529
in the future of the software industry

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:30,889
and finally interoperability today the

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:34,069
users of our software expect to be able

00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,860
to communicate and interact with with

00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:38,389
others regardless of what device they're

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,670
using regardless of what operating

00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,769
system is running on regardless of what

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,019
type of network they're connected to and

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,000
regardless of even what applications

00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,930
specifically they're using to interact

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,079
with you that's all about ensuring right

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,240
that we are doing things in a very

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,500
consistent and interoperable way and the

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,290
focus of the apache software foundation

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,079
and its pragmatic approach to licensing

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,810
and so forth foster that

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,329
interoperability and and the way we need

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,949
to develop software going forward so all

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,230
these things I think are important these

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,329
four things are really how we we think

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,769
about this openness revolution and when

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,410
you have those four innings in place you

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,850
can have a very practical and

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,709
straightforward conversation with folks

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,990
about how to think about these things

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,880
it's the thing that we're seeing that

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,370
I'm seeing in my enterprise customers

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:33,170
right the need for thinking even more

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,209
specifically about how open source is

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,189
going to play into their application

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,339
development process because in order to

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:42,110
meet the needs of the customers of their

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,399
end users they have to be able to take

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,319
advantage of the latest and greatest

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,089
innovations at the pace that they happen

00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:50,290
an open source is the only place that

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,290
that's possible to do that

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,480
as it comes to our relationship

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,980
specifically there are a number of

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,300
projects that that we've already been

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,970
working with the apache software

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,529
foundation on some of them are big some

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,690
of them are you know maybe a little bit

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:07,779
smaller I think you know Apache Hadoop

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,580
is an interesting example where you know

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:13,350
we've engaged on that on that project

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,580
and the azure HD insights service is

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,830
essentially an Apache Hadoop

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,279
distribution powered by the cloud

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:24,130
allowing developers to bring the code

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,459
the tools the experiences they have from

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,760
the product to develop applications that

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,399
allow organizations to have greater

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,230
insights into their data and derive new

00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,510
value from that so an example of

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:42,399
partnering and you know being able to

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:45,160
build upon a project together in fact

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,800
this is an example where the PMC chair

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,690
is a Microsoft employee we're incredibly

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,750
proud of that especially given the fact

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:57,370
that that role requires just unwavering

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,350
emphasis on not being partial to any one

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,330
organization right and the fact that you

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,860
know we can have an employee that that

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,470
it can be successful in that position I

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,380
think it's a great testament to the to

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,260
the direction that we're moving you know

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,120
obviously as a company we've been a

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,850
sponsor the apache software foundation

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,890
for about seven years now i believe you

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,860
know that again is a testament to our

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,440
understanding and and support an

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,520
endorsement of the apache way of doing

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,540
software development another project i

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,240
want to point out it's a little bit

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,800
different that's also been becoming a

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,480
key part of the way we think about

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,000
things in our engagements you a patchy

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,370
Cordova project here's an example where

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,100
as developers are being asked to build

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,480
applications that run on multiple

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,160
different devices multiple different

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,130
form factors multiple different user

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,839
experience models that the only way to

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,000
do that is to really provide them the

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,770
opportunity to take a lot of the skills

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,750
they've developed over the last five ten

00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,700
years doing web development and apply

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,730
them to mobile application and device

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,680
development in this case in the most

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,670
recent versions of Visual Studio visual

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,790
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,650
we are incorporating Apache Cordova as a

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,020
first class development experience

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,910
inside the product we're contributing

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,340
back into that project you know

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,570
obviously doing some things around you

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,070
know adding support for maybe some

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:25,390
devices that aren't quite as popular as

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:26,710
others today windows phones but also you

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,450
know contributing back in and ensuring

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,150
that it's a more you know finding the

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,950
places that maybe aren't as glamorous to

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,570
work on in and ensuring that the

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,700
developer experience that inner loop

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,170
debugging code authoring building

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,120
experience is really first-class for

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,790
everyone regardless of what device

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,920
platform you're targeting it also then

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,500
sparked us and kind of motivated us to

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,380
go and invest in a new emulations

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,090
experience for Android one that was

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,470
targeted more at the developer of an

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,710
application running on an Android device

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,420
then maybe so the hardware provider

00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,730
ensuring that Android one runs well on

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,890
their device so we now have you know

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,890
we've introduced a new android emulator

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:08,260
that will be an open source project as

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,880
well I don't think it is quite yet today

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,560
but I know that's on the roadmap for the

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,720
project so again I think this is another

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,200
example of how thinking about not only

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,280
just you know working with a project and

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,810
building around it working in and

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,360
contribute to it but then how that also

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,310
sparks other efforts that we do to go

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,740
and expand and help the broader

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:32,290
ecosystem of software developers so

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,260
let's circle it about net obviously

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,790
something near and dear to my heart I

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,330
think the dotnet foundation is is an

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,970
interesting example of how you know we

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,530
can bring together the concept of open

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,270
source and developer communities and

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,610
really learning from and taking

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,860
inspiration from the apache software

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,390
foundation and the apache way as part of

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,010
what we did here back in November we

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,740
made some pretty big news when both

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,120
scott guthrie and soma so Scott got

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,290
three is the executive vice president of

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,350
the Microsoft cloud and enterprise

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,880
division soma is the corporate vice

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,580
president of the developer division at

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,400
Microsoft we made an announcement that

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,110
we were going to take that the dotnet

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,750
core server platform

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,060
and open source it and take it

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,600
cross-platform supporting Linux and the

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:24,670
Mac operating system that was huge the

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,070
response kind of amazing i'll show some

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,450
stats here in a minute it's what enabled

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,550
at the same time we also took our

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,620
existing you know what we think of as

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,769
the full framework and change the

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:38,589
license for the reference source to make

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,600
it just more comfortable for others to

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:41,800
to go and not only learn from it but

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,839
incorporate that code into their

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,450
projects and that's what enabled the

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,519
tweet that that Miguel did you know

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,140
around improving the mono product by

00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,790
allowing them to feel confident they

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,250
could use our implementations look at

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:58,540
our source and included in their in

00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,880
their efforts so the dotnet foundation

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,220
actually it has an anniversary i think

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,500
maybe just past it's a year old we

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:10,089
announced it last april at our building

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,860
conference and it really was our

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,620
recognition of an opportunity that we

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,850
saw in the the open source and

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,280
specifically dot net developer

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,130
communities a lot of folks ask well why

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,410
why'd you create a new foundation

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,900
obviously you know we believe that that

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,209
a project should go and work with

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,440
whichever foundation meets you know the

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,020
best matches what they're trying to

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,780
accomplish we saw an opportunity to

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,910
create a foundation that was focused on

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,390
net and focused on the developer

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,910
community around net and provide that

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,100
consistent ability for people with

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,770
like-minded needs to go and interact and

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,860
and work together we also saw it as an

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,549
opportunity to present some new options

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:57,700
for people the.net foundation is open in

00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,460
terms of the license you use as long as

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,799
one that's you know we feel applies and

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,470
fits within the the direction of the.net

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,980
foundation which is to create a vibrant

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,669
community around net that is both

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,070
supportive of commercial and

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,500
non-commercial investments so we don't

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,429
mandate a license we don't mandate a

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,720
governance model we made it you have one

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,130
but we want you to pick the governance

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,860
model for your project that works best

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,470
with your community

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,120
and and that's really what it's all

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,150
about that's why we created it that's

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,070
that's what we saw as the opportunity

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:38,380
ahead of ours you know to go capitalize

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:39,760
on now it has been we also wanted to go

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,280
and ensure that we were doing this in

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,679
the in the right in the right way in the

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,210
best way and not fall back to what

00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,790
people would think of as our classic

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,940
approach which was we figured out and

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:55,660
then we go unleash it upon the world so

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,610
last year we started with this the the

00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,950
most minimum we could think of a basic

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,690
structure for an organization and enough

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,940
to engage with the developer community

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,710
to figure out exactly what and shape how

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,710
the foundation would work so in the last

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,650
12 months we refined the foundation we

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,780
have a set of foundation governance

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,150
bylaws and so forth that are now been

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,299
ratified and are available about a month

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,790
ago we formed a Technical Advisory

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,880
Council for the foundation itself it's a

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,640
nine-member council that represents

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,200
technical leaders in the.net space most

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,510
of them are project owners specifically

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,330
of projects in the foundation that can

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,429
go and do the next level of work around

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,280
the ecosystem and community and then

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:40,210
just about a week ago I was excited to

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,820
announce that we have a full-time

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,230
executive director now Martin Woodward

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,169
is now the executive director of the

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,690
dotnet foundation turns out he he

00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,280
actually is an interesting individual he

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,870
has more experience in the java

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,120
community than he does in the.net

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,610
community but we're excited to have him

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,830
around and and he's someone that

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,840
definitely would love to hear from you

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:07,900
if you're interested in engaging with us

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:09,940
on on things the aspect of this that you

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,850
know we wanted to go do was really go

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,200
and ensure that you know we were

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,429
creating this this community of

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,690
like-minded people people that were

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,760
interested in the same donor and

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,610
fostering innovation around net and

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,990
we've seen that it started to happen

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,110
already and going forward will continue

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:28,720
to define and refine how the foundation

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,820
helps these projects evolve helps them

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,010
cultivate helps mentor where mentorship

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,240
is needed where promotion is needed the

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,240
visibility those kinds of things

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,460
I mentioned that when we made the

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:45,179
announcement it was while I will admit

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,760
it it was probably a bigger impact than

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,559
I even anticipated it would have a

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,080
couple interesting things happened on

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,760
that day in November the the

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,950
announcements around dotnet being open

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,990
source and cross-platform hit number one

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,110
trending in places like Reddit and

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,149
hacker news which in case you didn't

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:08,179
know don't typically tend to be friendly

00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:10,500
to Microsoft that was pretty amazing the

00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,240
matter of fact that the topic is I

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,210
believe still the most popular topic and

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,559
read it in the programming category oh

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,419
and by the way it just so happens that

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,580
at the time we were competing with

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:24,929
little things going on in the world like

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,669
landing on a comet things like that and

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,750
we you know still managed to go kind of

00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:32,970
hold our own there as far as the the

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,090
repositories they're actually quite

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,500
healthy all of these are available on

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,980
github that's where we do our work now

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,130
you see you know over 7400 stars for the

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,370
core FX repo for 200 Forks lots and lots

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,630
of contributions over 1,800 commits an

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,870
interesting aspect of that is over ten

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,940
percent of those our contributions have

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:58,590
been accepted from non Microsoft

00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,360
developer non-microsoft employees and a

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,860
lot of them are very very meaningful so

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,409
it's not you know little things it's

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,940
it's the big things that are coming in

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:10,710
and which is great to see even before we

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,899
had done that even before we announced

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,510
open sourcing of net and so forth there

00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:17,820
was engagement in the open source

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,940
community from net developers there

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,710
approximately ten projects in the apache

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,350
software foundation that have C sharp

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,830
components to them again some big some

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,570
small but it just shows that it's what

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,070
smart dust to realize the dotnet

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,169
developers were ready they were ready to

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,299
get into this environment ready to be

00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,299
part of this kind of openness movement

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,340
of course for us one of the most

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,889
interesting aspects of this I go back to

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,750
the those four elements that we think

00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:49,630
about when we talk about openness it's

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,960
not just about putting the

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,540
it wasn't just about moving our repo to

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,760
to github and making it public it was

00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,180
about the change that that was going to

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,340
cause in the culture of the organization

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,950
and that's something that we really have

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,770
pulled from and learned and looked at

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,050
what what has has been successful with

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,460
the apache software foundation as well

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,650
as just sort of the apache way and

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,830
thinking about how we change the culture

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:20,140
of our organization so it's going from

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,550
the repo being private behind you know

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,640
only on our corporate network to being

00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:27,720
public it's going from moving our entire

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,430
approach to software development design

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,670
code reviews pull request all of that

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,350
being completely done in the public

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,880
being done as part of an open community

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,080
the team has done a number of

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,800
interesting things where we're

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,300
experimenting with live live design

00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,910
meetings that are broadcast and then

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:49,300
recorded for people to look at going

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,010
back to the earlier keynote I will say

00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,960
we also learned that when you put

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,410
developers that only have to interact

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,020
with themselves they can be a little

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:02,770
more they tend to get a little more

00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,140
direct in their feedback and so we've

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:07,300
had to go and foster that change and

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,800
help them realize that no you're you

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,980
were part of a broader world you're part

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,990
of a broader community now right really

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,070
helping them think about that something

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,690
that everybody in this room already

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,400
knows but you would be surprised a

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,080
number of Microsoft folks that

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,940
developers it didn't was when they first

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:29,110
realized that those followers were all

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,640
going to see their pull requests so

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,460
rather than five people code reviewing

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,450
your code down the hall in office you

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:40,420
had 1500 people 15,000 people looking at

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,490
those changes awesome added motivation

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,650
for the developers to make sure they

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:47,410
were really going and kind of completing

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,660
things before they check them in may be

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,970
a little uncomfortable for them but hey

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,110
as the as a manager I kind of like that

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,549
stuff

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,139
so you know that's the way we think

00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,090
about things that's kind of how we we

00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:01,980
look at it we're really pushing the

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,380
language team has done similar things

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,139
the c-sharp team is now doing the design

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,630
for the next version of C sharp all on

00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,190
on github all you know all of the design

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,139
meeting notes are there they're an

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:18,750
example where they haven't quite matured

00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:20,009
to live broadcast language meetings but

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,600
they are publishing all the notes and

00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:23,669
having conversations about it and they

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,080
will get there as well it's just a

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:27,080
learning it's just an evolution for us

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:34,559
you know I think that really what this

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,299
this represents is that in addition to

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,110
you are you know the contributions we've

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:41,610
been making i would say significantly to

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,070
open source projects both here at the

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,529
apache software foundation and beyond is

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:49,409
really what we're i wanted to kind of

00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:52,590
help communicate is that this is really

00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:55,019
our commitment in our belief that by

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,600
extending our work creating a

00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,789
cross-platform in open source net we're

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,529
facilitating and enabling the beginning

00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:06,659
of rapid innovation on that platform

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:09,149
using microsoft technologies from non

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:12,450
Microsoft technologies creating this

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:14,159
open and interoperable landscape that

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,190
allows all of us as software developers

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,470
to more efficiently more productively

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:23,100
meet the needs of our customers meet the

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,750
needs of the users of our software it's

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,360
really exciting for me to be here today

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,490
to get the opportunity to interact with

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,590
some of the people that have been the

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,440
most influential in defining and

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,330
continuing to refine what we think of as

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,639
a great way what we agree is a great way

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,129
to build software that is following the

00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:43,850
apache way right focusing on community

00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:46,250
and then quality code will follow in

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:50,220
this world of a mobile-first cloud-first

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,230
environment we have to move fast we have

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,519
to work together and we have to be

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,580
increasing open if we're going to be

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,250
successful earlier I talked about the

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,929
four things we think of as being part of

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,779
the openness movement the openness

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,580
revolution open source open standards

00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,090
people

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,279
interoperability these are things that

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,740
are that are not new to you these are

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,720
things that you have have helped the

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,120
software industry understand and realize

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,880
and I just want to take the opportunity

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,510
to acknowledge that we're listening we

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,919
got it we appreciate it and we're going

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:29,299
to embrace it and help work with it I

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,309
also want you to realize that Microsoft

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,580
is committed to being a member of this

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:36,620
open community we we know it is the only

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,179
way that we can be successful as an

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,929
organization we know it is the best way

00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:44,450
for us to build the software that that

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,340
our customers need to facilitate the

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,309
partnerships across the software

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,500
industry that we need to be successful

00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:55,039
and to create just a great and vibrant

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,840
developer community so with that I just

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,700
want to say thank you again for the

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,860

opportunity for us as open source

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,269
software developers to collaborate and

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,940
work together right on the future of

00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:28,039
great development platforms across all

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,049
computing technologies all community

00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,360
