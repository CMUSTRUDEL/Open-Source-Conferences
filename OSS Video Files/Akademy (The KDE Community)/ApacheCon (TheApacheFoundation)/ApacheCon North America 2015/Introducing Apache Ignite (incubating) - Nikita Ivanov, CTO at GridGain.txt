thank you for joining me this morning

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,010
for this quicker keynote what I want to

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,570
talk about it is Apache ignite it's a a

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,250
will introduce you to this new

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,759
incubating project in apache software

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,890
foundation patch ignite we call it in a

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,869
memory data fabric or as we

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,820
affectionately call it an operating

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,859
system for a fast data applications and

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,460
if I can switch it so what is the

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,380
in-memory data fabric essentially a

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,860
patrick not is a java-based middleware

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,989
software that architectural slides in

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,629
between your data sources in your

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,059
applications the results can be anything

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,610
in the sequel no sequel flat file system

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,170
dupage the FS your apps can be written

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,629
particular any language with support

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,930
natively JVM based languages and what it

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,750
does it provides the key benefits of

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,190
in-memory computing unprecedented speed

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:05,670
and radical scale so one some of the key

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:07,560
features of in-memory data fabric we

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,090
call it a fabric for a reason it really

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,760
provides a widest and deeper set of

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,990
in-memory computing capabilities

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,330
anywhere from one of the most advanced

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,610
data grades on the market today which is

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,700
essentially an object key value store

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,320
with a full transactional support and a

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,460
full sequel support to compute great

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,390
computer with an ignite project is

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,090
probably one of the most sophisticated

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,070
computer it available today we support

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,549
multiple MapReduce options with support

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,650
abp classic HP seen even MPI based

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,689
message passing based interface for

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,479
computational across large in-memory

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,000
cluster we support advanced clustering a

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,960
patch ignite is one of your projects on

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,579
the planet that has production

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,829
installations for a transactional

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,259
topology with over 2,000 nodes in the

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,659
cluster very few types of software where

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,090
few projects overall can handle that

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,820
scale we can in multiple production

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,819
settings we also have for example in

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,770
memory file system that's fairly unique

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,870
it can work as a standalone file system

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,060
in memory close

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,540
glasser computers what can work as a

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,730
caching layer on top of HDFS pretty cool

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,650
stuff we have massagee built into the

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,540
fabric as well we have a service great

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,900
for your services as a lace on the same

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,060
cluster we have very unique streaming

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,650
and event processing built it in as well

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,280
with the full sequel support it fully

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,810
integrated with the data grid as well

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,140
then we have a memory a dupe accelerator

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,629
pretty cool stuff it really plugin

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,180
blakeslee that helps you basically

00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,970
accelerates any classic Hadoop payloads

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,970
with absolutely zero code change in zero

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,609
etl and no data movement all you exist

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,200
in you know I've big MapReduce jobs

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:57,170
within a language can just work much

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,420
faster without absolutely no code change

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,000
no data movements and we have many other

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,709
features so as you can see that's why we

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,810
call it a fabric because it really

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,420
covers a lot of different use cases all

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,790
rooted in memory processing all

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,730
essentially based on an extremely high

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,780
performance in highest scalability let

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,220
me give you a couple of words about a

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,810
history of the project the project is

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,889
really started as a great game project

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,419
in 2005 myself a microphone or dimension

00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,359
we really were the first line of code in

00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,329
2005 literally 10 years ago on over the

00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:31,220
years project matured and developed and

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,620
we utilize different licenses for

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,209
open-source back from LG bail to GPL and

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,250
then couple years ago with which the

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,650
passion last year we moved to apache

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,090
software foundation today we basically

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,400
part of their part in debating and

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,250
through the cooler body apache not is

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,470
they weren't the most mature proven in

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,180
memory systems in the world today we

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,900
have hundreds of production deployment

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,699
we may be many many years in production

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,799
lots of clients thousands of open-source

00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,810
users and hopefully we're going to build

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,970
thriving and interesting community here

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,819
in the patch and we'll be glad you part

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,639
of that community i want to point out

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,329
one it's the point here is that little

00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,269
in the last maybe two or three years

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:15,350
apache software foundation has really

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,990
developed a

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,970
a family of products of family of

00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,070
projects rather for an emery computing

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,960
that rivals practically anything else

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,110
available elsewhere in the commercial

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,900
world anywhere from our best friends and

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,250
apache spark for a classic data science

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,140
machine learning and interactive

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,260
analytics all the way to a batch ignite

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,040
that now provides you a computational

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,740
ethics transactional data processing and

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,050
kind of classic HBC MVP today in apache

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,810
software foundation we have the widest

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,900
the deepest ecosystem of in-memory

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,700
computing and that's really exciting you

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,750
guys can join us projects you can use

00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:00,230
them it's really really unique that an

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,780
organization like an NSF has the best in

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,620
deepest technology across any commercial

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,480
or other open source projects last but

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,220
not the least your announcement we're

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,490
going to have a much deeper presentation

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,140
given by Dmitry lady to date for 20 and

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,630
bite everybody to join in and listen to

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,430
it a lot deeper conversation tomorrow we

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,680
have the whole day training on a patch

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,600
ignite starting at nine o'clock you guys

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,820
can pop in and pop out it's a whole day

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,350
event you can learn a lot from a people

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,770
who contribute to the project every day

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,260
and the last is we're gonna have pretty

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,150
unique in memory and conference two more

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,330
starting at but the more acquainted I'm

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,770
sorry starting at four fifteen and

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,810
that's basically a gathering for

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,610
everybody involved in a memory computing

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,290
or like to learn in marriage basically

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,780
going to be able to see everybody from

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,700
the projects in Apache and maybe not an

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,980
Apache projects who anyhow related to in

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,690
memory computing so please join us if

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,660
you want to learn anything about in

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,660
memory at those events thank you

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,540
