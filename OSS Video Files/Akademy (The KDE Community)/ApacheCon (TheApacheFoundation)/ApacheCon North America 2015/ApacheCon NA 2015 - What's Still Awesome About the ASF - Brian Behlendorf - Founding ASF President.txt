rich invited me to kind of come and give

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,240
a speech to you guys to celebrate the

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,269
20th anniversary of the starting of the

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,759
web server project and definitely I've

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,070
always been very clear it was really a

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,960
group of us from day one and I thought I

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,250
would take those to the liberty to give

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,650
some ideas and some thoughts about

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,939
things that would all of you might want

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,720
to think about as we as we think with

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,369
the next 20 years of Apache so there is

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,800
a the photo you've probably all seen

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,869
that has the the feather in it and those

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,710
of us standing up at the 1998 Apache con

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,480
but one of the first news articles that

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,760
kind of showed us and try to kind of

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,460
portrayed this you know ragbag kind of

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,770
band of rebels or whatever kind of thing

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,780
appeared in pc week in july of 97 those

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,190
are only the five people who are were

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,480
part of the project who could show up

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,719
with a couple of hours notice to organic

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,670
on lines offices in San Francisco and I

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,260
it was the first one to kind of talk

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,180
about are you you know are you familiar

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,430
with Apache you know if you thought the

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,680
number one web server was Netscape or

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,060
Microsoft's you were wrong it's this

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,500
distributed group of UNIX engineers and

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,900
what I actually really liked about this

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,240
was in addition to like posing us as

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,759
rock stars or things like that was that

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,939
sense that it was not just one of us it

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,530
was not just you know coders sitting at

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,360
their their terminals it was actually

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,329
people with a sense of fun people with a

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,740
sense of community but there's a guy in

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,470
this photo as well that I'm really happy

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,110
what was here and he's kind of second

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,479
from the right by the way it's cliff

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,729
Skolnick here cliff should be around at

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,880
some point that he's on the far right

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,860
but the guy next to him is Alexi coasted

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,659
and Alexi for me epitomized a really fun

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,700
kind of side of those early days of

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,579
Apache and I think it still continues to

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,399
this day Alexi had been a participant

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,210
since very early on he was always one of

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:07,320
those developers who was very clear very

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,700
thoughtful very I really into new

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,530
developers helping them come up the

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,410
learning curve working on documentation

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,480
when that needed

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,750
doing standing off the rough edges of

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,550
the project and and really practicing

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,920
you know what today we'd call nonviolent

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,180
communication right but having a being

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,160
able to have a conversation without

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,750
somebody else feeling like they're on

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,450
the you know they're in the wrong or

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,430
feel bad for what they believe so a

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,650
couple of years into his participation

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,420
of the project actually just before this

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,400
photo was taken oh and by the way the

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,120
photo was taken in the data center room

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,070
at organic where the first box that ran

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,800
Apache org was sitting so pretty much

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,310
right behind right behind us was was the

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,250
server so Alexi sends this note just

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,560
before this photo was taken and he says

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,240
you guys I'm really sorry but the level

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,040
of my contribution to a pet to the web

00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,480
server project might decline a little

00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,950
bit going forward because I've just been

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,920
accepted as a freshman at Stanford

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,360
University and it was at that point that

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,330
we realized that he'd been collaborating

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,540
with us since he was a high school light

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,430
sophomore junior and yet he had been not

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,260
only you know technically clear and

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,070
wrote you know great patches and such

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,060
but he also was exhibit exhibited these

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,090
communication skills in this and this

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,540
character that was really impressive to

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,010
me so I this was this was really kind of

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,500
the start I think of us trying to define

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,780
a culture you know that kind of is just

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,400
second nature to us around this time is

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,550
also what I'd call the Arab Spring of

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,500
open-source 1998 when everybody was

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,360
looking for for heroes looking for like

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,280
who's going to take down Microsoft who's

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,900
going to you know subvert this or that

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,830
right kind of the Arab Spring for the

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,870
web at the same time but uh but really

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,090
what it was part of this culture at

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,739
Apache and where we really came from was

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,480
something we inherited from an earlier

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,670
organization still around and still

00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,260
still charging forward called the IETF

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,430
the internet Engineering Task Force

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,260
right and those principles that they're

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,330
a lot of different facets to it but the

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,370
one that I think really mattered the

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,410
most to the participants was this sense

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,650
of rough consensus and running code

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,209
right that you could have a technical

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,430
conversation about the right way to do

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,140
things and that conversation should be

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,789
fairly transparent you didn't have to

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,130
get everybody to agree it didn't have to

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,870
be designed by committee

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,370
people could move forward and and and

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,140
work on things but at the end of the day

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:34,270
if your code didn't run and Minh right

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,040
if you don't have an implementation you

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,830
can point to that speaks the protocol

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,400
that is really the standards that the

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,990
ITF for defining for everything I if you

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,490
didn't show that it worked in code and

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,430
ideally in two separate independent

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,740
implementations you couldn't progress it

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,140
forward to an internet standard part of

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,150
that culture came because really a 95

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,910
the those of us who were setting up

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,520
websites or working with Internet

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,930
technologies kind of lived in this soup

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,540
of software that came from people

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,640
involved in the IETF all right every

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,070
successful internet standard to date has

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,610
come from open source code ment to

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,430
implement these open protocols so send

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,530
mail right the reason why smtp became

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,720
the standard for email really was thanks

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,600
to send mail and a couple of other open

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,510
source mail platforms simply making it

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,670
easy for everyone to adopt being both a

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,480
reference implementation but also

00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,380
production quality right we might laugh

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,000
at the idea of send mail being

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,620
production quality but it really was it

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,540
worked who had the volumes of email we

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,500
were dealing with at the time likewise

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,480
with DNS and bind all right I and apache

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,160
really carried that tradition forward

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,500
that sense of you know we could have

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,080
people like roy fielding who is here

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,420
working on defining that the protocol he

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,170
acted as the cheetah chief author of the

00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:58,480
HTTP 10 and 1 dot one spec i believe and

00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,520
and yet also at the same time writing

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,690
code and helping us understand how the

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,110
implementation affected the standard and

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,660
vice versa right but it was also this

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,820
sense that you know on the ITF mailing

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,970
list communities would form people would

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,100
meet four times a year face to face and

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,830
they would they would share ideas they'd

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,780
share a beer they talked about what they

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,050
were trying to accomplish but that what

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,210
made the IETF work wasn't some master

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,730
roadmap of what we want to accomplish

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,010
and when and what it has to do but

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,430
instead the sense of a good process a

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,590
good community a sense of

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,260
a lot of these things i'll talk about

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,270
and that out of that comes healthy

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,300
software right it comes comes good

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,090
production quality software and and so

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,160
as we got going we realized that this

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,150
thing that was second nature to us this

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,040
thing that was kind of unwritten

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,040
unspoken you know maybe we should start

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,100
to crystallize and there was a one

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,930
incident somewhat early on in a patch in

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,020
the web server project history that

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,730
helped crystallize this at least for me

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,430
there was a developer who showed up from

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:13,110
a large UNIX vendor that specialized in

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:16,800
graphical workstations that there's a

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:19,080
couple of those right who had been a fan

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,580
of the project for a long time and he

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,410
wrote a couple of us privately saying

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,080
great news guys I've just gotten

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,870
approval for my manager to port Apache

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,100
to our new 64-bit chips right and it's

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,870
just going to scream and it's going to

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,030
make it so fast and it's awesome and

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,380
I've already done all the work so I'm so

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm just gonna like start posting

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,560
patches and hopefully you know hopefully

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,970
you guys can commit to getting it in

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,410
because my boss would be really happy if

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,910
it gets upstream and then we can take

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,220
some credit for it all right I'm really

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,780
all right well show up on the list and

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,200
start posting some patches and we'll see

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:53,280
what happens so he posts this 60

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,320
kilobyte patch file right which had a

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,960
tremendous number of changes to core

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,770
parts of the server a lot of castes

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,900
64-bit rather than true ways of portably

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,670
writing code like he truly did port it

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,670
to his platform but but kind of forgot

00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,740
about the rest of us right and the 60

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,140
killer within about 20 minutes i think

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,290
it was dean got it who responded very

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,940
politely for him well yeah this is not

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,820
going to work at all let's talk about

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,010
how a better way to do to do all of this

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,630
right and and the development developer

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,550
from this large unix mender responded

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,560
well we can't really change much because

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,080
this is the first patch of 10 that I've

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,870
got and if we change the first all the

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,520
other dips aren't going to work and it

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,590
was at that point that we realized that

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,900
you know what we'd lucked onto here by

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,200
simply having a process that long before

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,210
the agile manifesto was agile right long

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,580
before extreme programming was about

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,340
heavy communication between individuals

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,190
as your work

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,230
the code and and and and this kind of

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,390
tight feedback loop partly because of

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,330
the limitations of CBS you couldn't have

00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,530
long-running branches right so pretty

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,120
much you know you wanted to commit

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,640
things pretty quickly if you were if you

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,040
were patching from it or for Kang but

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,930
some of that also engendered a culture

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,580
of what I think what I think we could

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,290
kind of say became a healthy software

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,330
development community right so the first

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,400
really important factor of that was it

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,130
was humility a sense amongst the

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,260
developers that you might think you're

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,730
really hot but what you what you develop

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,040
it doesn't really matter till it gets

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,050
socialized until it gets accepted till

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,730
you can have a conversation about it and

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,370
the earlier you start that conversation

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,910
long before you have 1060 kilobyte if

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,800
files to submit the better right because

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,870
that increases the odds of making sure

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,150
that it actually can get accepted and

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,710
upstream and solve real problems you

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,320
also need to have empathy for the end

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,860
users right you need to understand who's

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,690
going to be using this code and and and

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,100
and want to make their life easier not

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,930
just adding new features not just

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,400
solving your own problem and then ending

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,170
because your contract ended and you've

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,270
got to move on to the next contract but

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,570
actually thinking about standing off the

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,280
rough edges eliminating the paper cuts

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,520
but then also setting it up for the next

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,470
point which is you want new people in

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,370
your project right you want to be able

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,830
to have something a pipeline of

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,490
contributors who progress up this ladder

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:20,740
from being just ordinary users to expert

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,190
users to expert users that help other

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,170
users and I want to note marks lemco as

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,420
somebody who was also really critical to

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,060
this mark contributed a few patches to

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,920
the web server project but he spent a

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,470
tremendous amount of time on the usenet

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,590
newsgroups and on our early users groups

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,750
helping people get past the the the

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,490
really awful install process understand

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,500
the really awful docs he was a

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,080
tremendous force and helping grow those

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,390
early days of Apache but but there's

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,210
this ladder right average users expert

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,890
users somebody who helps other users

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,990
somebody who reports the bug somebody

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,910
who reports a bug with a patch and then

00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,440
somebody says finally I've got a couple

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,030
of these patches and fixes and I would

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,900
just want to get closer to understanding

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,450
where that about

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,700
it's going so they join the dev list so

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,100
they start taking on other people's bug

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,010
reports and at some point you know

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,660
they've issued so many dips or pull

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,300
requests that somebody says will k fine

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,280
we'll just make you a committer right to

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,170
be coming and now we've got the PMC is

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,830
becoming a part of the core team right

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,870
and each step up that ladder should be

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,640
as easy as possible right it should be a

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,080
function of are you going to spend the

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,540
time to understand the tech and

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,570
understand the process and communication

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,540
but how do we make that a real flow

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,520
right and a part of this as well as

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,800
transparency I mean we kind of didn't

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,040
have really the luxury of being able to

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,710
spend a lot of money and have developers

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,630
in the same physical place we or or have

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,550
like a venture capitalist who would fund

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,770
the web server project from day one and

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,720
then you know build build a lot of stuff

00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,780
ourselves in in both in the same place

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,090
and 4411 company we kind of had to be

00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,680
transparent because not only was the

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,660
most efficient thing it was the easiest

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,850
thing it was easier to set up a mailing

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,940
list with open subscription or a public

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,590
CVS tree a public website than it was to

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,310
try to lock things down and down and

00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,250
decide who should be inside and outside

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,630
and so that transparency that sense of I

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,580
if it did if the conversation the

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,530
technical conversation doesn't happen on

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,750
the mailing list it doesn't matter right

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,210
if you can whiteboard things all day

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,310
long you can meet for drinks or at a

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,660
conference but if it didn't happen on

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,130
the list it didn't happen in front of

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,690
the right audience and that meant you

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,460
could always go to the list find the

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,960
history of the conversation about a

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,870
feature and understand why it was

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,730
changed right view a few other quick

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,370
points carrots not sticks this is kind

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,140
of the license conversation but the

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,480
Apache License was intentionally picked

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,630
up partly because we had some bsd types

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,280
like Ben Laurie partly because we had

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,230
this IETF culture if we're just building

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,150
this tech we hope everybody use it uses

00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,470
it but there is also this kind of karma

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,840
kind of thing I think a lot of us

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,730
resonated with which was we're giving

00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,350
you good tech you we want you to use it

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,390
you shouldn't feel compelled to give

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,890
anything back if you do then when you

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,480
give us a patch we know it comes from

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,370
the right place that you come you're

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,810
giving it to us because you want us to

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,279
upstream it not because you're

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,069
compelling not feeling

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,629
held to do that right and that made a

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:22,180
huge difference i think in bringing on a

00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:23,920
lot of the the big corporations you know

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,649
that otherwise we're somewhat allergic

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,240
to to that sense of obligation and it

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:31,060
ended up turning them into two really

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,860
big contributors independence and

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,269
teamwork is kind of self out in self

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,370
evident we were kind of all working as

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,410
individuals but but creating something

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,389
as a whole none of us needed to work

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,740
together that's right to fork that's in

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,800
the license meant that we could always

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,899
spiral off it meant that and do our own

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,660
thing whether inside of this org or

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,730
outside but that you know we all really

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,430
wanted to lift lift lift the boat and

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,649
then a kind of an essential laziness

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,699
which really we were smart enough to

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:02,860
rebrand later as a duoc recei i was

00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:04,870
never a very good coder you know anybody

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,579
else in the project can probably attest

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,230
to this and you know the small patches

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,959
that I made I think we refactored and

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,699
replaced pretty quickly I focused I

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,980
focused pretty quickly on the

00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:16,930
infrastructure partly because I was the

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,110
one volunteering a box and then two

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:22,089
boxes and a few more but because I was

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,980
more into this idea of things to cyd min

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:26,559
to the stars then I was about you know

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,990
somebody running my code and and I just

00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,490
jumped in and did it and I have been

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,589
following the infrastructure community

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,089
since then and I and and I think it's

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:36,790
absolutely essential that we've had paid

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,170
staff there and I I because at the scale

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,779
that we're managing these things today

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,110
volunteerism is really hard to reconcile

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,250
with with 99 percent of time but I I did

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,250
that because I thought that was the best

00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,269
way I could contribute you know and and

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,459
the kind of the decisions that get made

00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,319
are made by the people willing to jump

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,589
in and do things i think is an essential

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,899
aspect of these of these communities and

00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:01,420
so if you want a frame who here rekha

00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:06,309
gets the reference wants name the just

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,600
yell it out brazil right okay so you

00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,889
know choose a different movies every

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
time I give a speech sometimes at

00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,509
Soylent Green but but this time I felt

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,790
like the character that perhaps best

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,620
epitomizes in my mind what we've built

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,740
here is a network of Harry about Harry

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,829
Tuttle's

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,660
well okay but so Harry total is a

00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:27,820
heating engineer right essentially a

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,640
plumber right who shows up in this film

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,700
Brazil as kind of the hero yeah because

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,100
he helps make sense of this you know

00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,890
algorithmic bureaucracy gone horribly

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,720
wrong by jumping in you know in the

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,610
middle in the cover of night and helping

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,860
people sort out the ducks in there in

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,480
there in there home & heating when

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,070
ordinary bureaucracy ordinary

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,320
infrastructure completely fails right

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,970
and you know they don't expect payment

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,190
or if they do it's just donation or

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,529
whatever but he like he get he gets in

00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,630
he gets out and and like it's it's it's

00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,089
the stealthy kind of thing and I like to

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,560
think that we well that in some ways the

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,110
Internet has been built by people like

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,860
carrie Tuttle and that's kind of what

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,390
we've we've carried forward but I think

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,790
to scale beyond those early days those

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,320
really kind of you know revolutionary

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,089
kind of like let's let's keep the

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,980
internet free let's let's let's be these

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,529
kind of like wizards you stay up late to

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,649
reference another book I that there is

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,630
kind of a secret weapon here that as we

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,070
grew beyond the web server project as we

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,019
went into interesting areas we really

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,640
needed which is the the incubator and

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,290
I'm really happy that there's a session

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,959
right after this talking more about this

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,240
but every time I describe to somebody

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,519
how Apache works I have to mention the

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,250
incubator because you can talk all day

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,120
long about pmcs and nonprofit structure

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,410
and healthy communities but without an

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,449
incubator it sounds like it just

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,459
happened spontaneously and we know that

00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,680
that's not the case we know that there's

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,870
even if it's not of there's not a formal

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,750
document that finds the apache way or if

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,670
there's not you know some checklist what

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,449
there is is a community and a culture of

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,390
taking projects big or small you know as

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,339
big as open office right and and

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,140
converting them into a project that

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,240
works the way that we think they should

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,829
work that we like them to work and then

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,419
also handling all the details IP

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,459
clearance trademarks all that kind of

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,319
stuff and this is what separates us from

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,630
the crowd this is what separates us I

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,309
think from obviously the github xand

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,209
source forages but also from other

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,880
projects that are

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:32,750
more about driving a road map and less

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,330
about actually built building

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,990
interesting communities so now I want to

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,700
just talk about three things what

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,950
something I think the asf must do

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,809
something I think the asf should do and

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:49,659
then it's something i think the SF could

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:52,789
do so ross talked quite a bit about

00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,710
diversity all right and and we know we

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,380
have something of a culture problem in

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,929
the tech industry at large it's it's no

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,490
surprise this is by the way who caught

00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:04,760
the premiere of Silicon Valley last

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,850
night yeah hi Denise that was a lot of

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,799
fun but most people don't realize this

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,899
is a documentary this is not actually a

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,850
fictional show like there's way too much

00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:16,580
especially for me that it's too close to

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,289
home with silicon valley right now but

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,169
it's also not just about a geographic

00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,740
region it's about a community and a

00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:27,350
culture an industry that is broken in a

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,690
lot of really big ways and one of the

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,000
ways it's broken is in the gender

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,919
diversity and other aspects of diversity

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,279
as well but but gender is the really big

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,169
one for me I you know and thank you to

00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,210
Ross as well for highlighting this in

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,460
his talk every week I have a

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,770
conversation with a female engineer a

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,450
female fender a founder of a company of

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,630
a tech company who is considering

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,070
leaving the industry because they they

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,679
don't like the culture in it they don't

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,659
feel empowered they don't feel that it

00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,520
resonates with them and this is true for

00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:01,190
proprietary companies it's true somewhat

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,169
for open source projects as well but

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,419
there is a crisis here this is something

00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,940
that you know we've inherited it's not

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,860
it's not new it's something that but but

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,750
it has the sense is that it has gotten

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,850
worse my senses that it has gotten worse

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,250
and it's really hard for us to

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,070
understand how to address this Ross came

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,919
up with some very good suggestions the

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,480
two that I'd like to focus on is one

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,029
that actually strikes more to the core

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,919
of you know of Apache and I think

00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:31,250
actually even that photo from the early

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,740
days kind of reminds me of it it's very

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,710
easy to accidentally allow the concept

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,110
of meritocracy to become synonymous with

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,860
cognitive bias all right for us to think

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,390
about the people

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,040
we work with especially if we see them

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,120
on a regular basis face-to-face and

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,730
share drinks with them and get to know

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,230
them as people to not be able to

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,940
separate that from the technical

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,880
contributions their technical talent and

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,559
to read their emails in a different tone

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,270
of voice than we read emails from people

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,549
we haven't yet met and haven't yet

00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,570
bonded with right there's a lot of

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,429
terrific content out there about

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,020
understanding you know the dozens of

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,580
different kinds of cognitive bias that I

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,950
think it's worth your time worth

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:10,070
anyone's time to understand and read

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,380
through but I try to understand it and

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,600
try to always have that kind of empathy

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,179
to users and empathy to people coming

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,740
into our community that I like to

00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,960
believe is us at our best right and I

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,690
think if we did that that would help

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,160
sustain chily I think we also have to

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,900
continue to seek out new users and

00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,660
developers and unlikely sources right

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,010
Ross again it's some good ideas on this

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,190
who here has been a mentor for google

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,770
Summer of Code great thank you so much

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,040
some applause because that is such a

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,080
hard job and it's so critical to capture

00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,200
it to catching people at a very

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,380
formative part of their career likewise

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,090
presenting at other conferences that are

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,520
outside of the ordinary open source

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,010
conferences supporting organizations

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,410
like black girls code and and and and

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,660
and others that are focused on getting

00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:01,250
coding education out there to to a

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,490
broader audience these are all really

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,020
important things to continue to do so

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,950
now let me talk about what I think the

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,610
asf should do so a part of that founding

00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,570
team you know I think when we when we

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,280
you know got together and started

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,620
working on Apache I like to say it was a

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,530
mix of idealism and pragmatism nearly a

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,210
50-50 split the pragmatism was hey we

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,760
had this earlier pre-existing web server

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,500
and csa that was working all right and

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,330
then when that team of student

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,740
developers rightfully you know quit

00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,020
school and went to go work at Netscape

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,250
the rest of us kind of look to each

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,320
other and said can we continue this

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,150
forward right and so there and we're

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,549
using it why not right let's combine our

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,929
patches so there's that sense of

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,250
pragmatism that with little

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,350
modifications here and there and

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,540
sometimes major contributions we could

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,700
we could get this done but there is also

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,830
the sense of idealism the sense that we

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,030
didn't want the web which was still

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,730
pretty early

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,340
to go the way of the desktop and be

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:01,220
ninety-five percent owned as as desktops

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,140
were at that time by one vendor there

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,840
was and not to demonize anybody it you

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:09,110
know I times have changed right they

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,030
change in different ways but that sense

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,800
of idealism and pragmatism i think is

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,690
carried forward in a lot of our projects

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,080
but i'd like to reignite it a bit

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,240
because this this war is never won the

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,330
platforms change the names change the

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,190
company's change but people want to get

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,620
still get at the center of the internet

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:31,340
and own it and an extract rent for it

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,200
and we can't take we can't take any

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,050
layer of the internet for granted as

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,000
being irrevocably open and i'm an open

00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:41,690
source is one angle that open standards

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,340
or another that but you know I see

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,750
companies pitched so I'm an investor

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,730
these days and I see companies pitch us

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,080
all the time with business models that

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,900
are essentially about owning a layer of

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,640
the internet right a lot of the Bitcoin

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,020
community these days the companies in

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,910
that space are all about how do we take

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,340
this awesome distributed decentralized

00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,840
thing and add an essential layer in

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,170
between that everybody has to come to us

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,600
for right and there are even new

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,490
commercial sequel servers like I thought

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,410
at one point like who would ever do

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,930
another sequel server after my sequel

00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,370
and postgres right well sometimes

00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,900
there's good reasons for that and and

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,980
and there's there's commercial activity

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,010
around that and I'm not don't need to

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,380
demonize that but to the degree that you

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,940
know layers of open-source things make

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,820
it easier to build open-source things on

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,380
top of that and and and that the when

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,060
you have an open source platform in an

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,280
open source base of Technology you have

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,410
a much more generative platform on top

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,760
you can do more with it and to the

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,940
degree that the internet one and it

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,160
wasn't AOL right these things matter and

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,930
and I want you to think about the

00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,940
details on the last slide you know which

00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,310
technologies where doesn't it doesn't

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,960
matter so much as to realize we haven't

00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:51,250
won simply because everybody's using

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,230
javascript CSS and HTML 5 all right

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:58,040
fortunately flash is moving on sorry

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,200
flex but uh it's it's there are still

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,130
battles there still every time somebody

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,810
writes a mobile app for iOS only you

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,480
know I'm on Android and I'd love to try

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,940
periscope

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,890
I can't you know I feel like an angel

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:17,070
loses its wings so so keep that in mind

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:20,010
and this becomes especially important as

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,570
we think about this I want to say the

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,000
long term but this is the increasingly

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,890
near-term threats to what I'd call our

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,380
civil liberties online threats to the

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,480
way that we relate to technology think

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,270
about the fact for example that 20 years

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,490
ago we had the technical ability forget

00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,910
about right or anything like that merely

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:40,350
the technical ability to take a desktop

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,840
computer and replace the operating

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,940
system on it right that's great right

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,980
now to replace the operating system on

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,120
your phone you kind of have to look both

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,070
ways and make sure there's no

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,500
authorities over your shoulder right you

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,559
kind of have to go to a website you know

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,450
that that isn't necessarily you know on

00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:00,299
the up-and-up you could potentially be

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,490
installing something weird it's not it's

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,750
it's it's a it's a feature that it's a

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,809
function that's going away and it's

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,059
partly because what was a technical

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,400
advantage I think we now need to realize

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:14,850
is something of a almost a human right

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,410
right so part of this is the ability to

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,850
know what the technology is that we're

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,130
running on top of and not to start

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,010
sounding like Stallman but like when you

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,020
are you know when your life is mediated

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,570
by technology if you don't have the

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,340
freedom to look down that stack and see

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,710
what that technology is doing your

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,020
rights are threatened alright your

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,120
ability to drive your car where you want

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,530
to drive it to you know is threatened to

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,950
reference another funny scene from

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:42,660
Silicon Valley last season so right now

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,280
there is a war on our ability to

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,799
communicate confidentially over the

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,919
internet right and we need to be awake

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,780
for that our ability to have control and

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,450
sovereignty over our technology is in

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,000
question if there's one URL I can throw

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,760
out here there was an essay that Cory

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,410
Doctorow wrote about three years ago

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,299
called the war the coming civil war over

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,480
general purpose computing right where he

00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:07,890
talks about the fact that it's hard to

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,950
root your phone's right it's hard to

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,570
root your car you know at one level it's

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,370
hard today and you know may not get

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,929
easier but hopefully well hard to root

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,360
your doorbell when it's connected to the

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,919
internet right and this is a civil war

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,440
that will play

00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,269
out over you know commercial

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,889
technologies but increasingly over

00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,690
government policy over this as well and

00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:29,029
we have a role we have a role to play in

00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,039
building foundational open technologies

00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,499
that implement open standards to bend

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,289
this arc then bend these technologies

00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:40,309
towards what I think would serve all of

00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:42,739
our interests right so we used to joke

00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,149
especially in the 90s the geeks would

00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:46,730
inherit the earth to kind of you know

00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:48,799
riff on on that line from the Bible and

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,649
we kind of have now which is a little

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,600
scary but now that's on us now we kind

00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:55,070
of have this responsibility I think to

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,960
make sure that we're good ancestors you

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,549
know that the technologies that come

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,159
around that in 20 years when we have a

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,619
patch econ 2035 we were able to look

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,080
back and say yeah we've we still have

00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:07,220
fought for and maintained that sense of

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,529
control and sense of sovereignty over

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,809
what comes from below and to other orgs

00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,889
that that I'm involved in that focus on

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:15,499
this the Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:17,389
and the Mozilla Foundation which yes

00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:19,129
they build a great web browser but

00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:20,809
they're also really about the underlying

00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:22,820
stack of technologies including

00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:24,980
increasingly Firefox OS which is the

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,379
mobile phone operating system that are

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,039
about the consumer side of this story

00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:32,809
right the third thing that I want to

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,049
throw out there and what I think the asf

00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:37,669
could do so the world needs more of us

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,549
right the world certainly doesn't

00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:42,769
necessarily need more open source

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,710
nonprofits out there but the world does

00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:47,389
need more membership driven

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:51,139
community-focused software development

00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:54,739
communities and as an example there's

00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:57,619
some of your most Sarah I perhaps even a

00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,879
couple people yes excellent so Sarah I

00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:01,100
can tell you a long story but I've only

00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:02,659
got a few minutes Oh Sarah is basically

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,639
the open sourcing of the Vista

00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:06,259
electronic health care record system

00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:10,039
written with our tax dollars if you're a

00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:11,720
US citizen 24 for the Veterans

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:13,580
Administration this was something that

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,919
was open open source by Freedom of

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,960
Information Act about 10 years ago and

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,179
then and now has officially been open

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,830
sourced by the VA working with a whole

00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,619
bunch of different orgs to try to build

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,960
a new type of community of health IT

00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,309
practitioners right with a electronic

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,139
health care record system is kind of the

00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,980
operating system for that but hopefully

00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:35,280
a whole new wave of apps on top

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,500
in health IT in other sectors in

00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,929
software for other government functions

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,370
you know like we have 50 states with 50

00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,679
different Department of Motor Vehicles

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,390
why do they separately procure software

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,020
why is there not just one open source

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:51,240
DMV software or tax authority software

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,760
right or water management software like

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,830
like I hear about these kinds of names

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,169
all the time there's company there's

00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,820
groups like code for america and the gov

00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,860
lab and others that are helping

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,080
governments better understand technology

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,330
open technologies and others but there's

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,190
still a lack of an organization that can

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:12,179
sit at the center in a beneficent way

00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:14,240
like Apache has and be a meta community

00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,320
for for the for this type of activity

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,120
likewise with environmental monitor

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,040
monitoring tools civil rights tools

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,440
there's lots of individual projects lots

00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,620
of things up on github lots of just

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,510
disparate kind of activities but what

00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,340
we've really done at the asf i think is

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,500
crack the code on this building a

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,570
community of communities kind of you

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,220
know achieving escape velocity /

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,660
Dunbar's number and figuring out how to

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,210
have enough systemization and just

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,990
enough process and just enough

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,450
standardization and how we launch new

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,070
communities to create a much more

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,890
productive much more interesting

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,510
technical community and build some real

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,660
things and this is a gaping need out

00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,640
there so I think I think what if we

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,460
could figure out how to take what's made

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,010
the board work what's made the SF work

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,720
as an organization what's helped other

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,030
people understand us and distill it down

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,950
to a science make it repeatable we would

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,350
have a tremendous impact on the state of

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,460
Technology in the world and finally

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,960
thank you for 20 years of just

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,970
awesomeness having 20 years of having

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,490
something to kind of brag about to

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,200
friends and and I always look at even in

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,120
the worst of like debates over over

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,770
mailing lists and things like that I've

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,780
known it at the core there's been a set

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,790
of ideas and principles and people that

00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,200
have just been awesome to even be

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,200
affiliated with so thank you for that

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,550
and that's it

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,850
