About Apache Local Chapters (ALC) --

Apache Community Development ("ComDev") welcomes new participants to the Apache community and mentors them in "The Apache Way". The Apache Local Community program is a ComDev initiative that launched early 2020, comprising local groups of Apache enthusiasts, each called an "ALC Chapter", that will be responsible for organising local Apache-related events.
