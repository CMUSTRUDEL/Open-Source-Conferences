	Streaming Machine Learning with Apache Kafka and TensorFlow (without a Data Lake)

Machine Learning (ML) is separated into model training and model inference. ML frameworks typically load historical data from a data store like HDFS or S3 to train models. This talk shows how you can avoid such a data store by ingesting streaming data directly via Apache Kafka from any source system into TensorFlow for model training and model inference using the capabilities of “TensorFlow I/O”. The talk compares this modern streaming architecture to traditional batch and big data alternatives and explains benefits like the simplified architecture, the ability of reprocessing events for training different models, and the possibility to build a scalable, mission-critical, real time ML architecture with muss less headaches and problems
