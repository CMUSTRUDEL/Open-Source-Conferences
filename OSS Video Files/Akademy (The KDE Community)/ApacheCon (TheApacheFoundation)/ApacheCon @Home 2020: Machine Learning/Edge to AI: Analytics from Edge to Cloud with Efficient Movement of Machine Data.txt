	Edge to AI: Analytics from Edge to Cloud with Efficient Movement of Machine Data
Timothy Spann, Paul Vidal

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

In this talk, we will walk you through the simple steps to build and deploy machine learning for sentiment analysis and YOLO object detection as part of an IoT application that starts from devices collecting sensor data and camera images with MiNiFi. This data is streamed to Apache NiFi which integrates with Cloudera Data Science Workbench for classification with models in real-time as part of the real-time event stream. We parse, filter, fork, sort, query with SQL, dissect, enrich, transform,utilizing TensorFlow and MXNet processors in NiFi, join and aggregate data as it is ingested. The data is landed in Big Data stores in the cloud for batch and interactive analytics with Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache Kudu and Apache Impala. Utilizing Intel Movidius, NVidia Jetson Xavier, NVidia Jetson Nano and Google Coral Edge processors as part of a real-time streaming deep learning flow that includes Deep Learning Classification at the edge, at the gateway, in the cloud and at every step along the way.
