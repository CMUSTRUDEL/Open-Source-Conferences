Deep learning community has largely evolved independently from the prior community of data science and machine learning community in NumPy. While most deep learning frameworks now provide NumPy-like math and array library, they differ in the definition of the operations which creates a steeper learning curve of deep learning for machine learning practitioners and data scientists. This creates a chasm not only in the skillsets of the two different communities, but also hinders the exchange of knowledge. The next major version, 2.0, of Apache MXNet (incubating) seeks to bridge the fragmented deep learning and machine learning ecosystem. It provides NumPy-compatible programming experiences and simple enhancements to NumPy for deep learning with the new Gluon 2.0 interface. The NumPy-compatible array API also brings the advances in GPU acceleration, auto-differentiation, and high-performance one-click deployment to the NumPy ecosystem.

Sheng Zha is an Applied Scientist at Amazon AI. He’s also a committer and PPMC member of Apache MXNet (Incubating), steering committee member of Linux AI Foundation ONNX, and maintainer of the GluonNLP project. In his research, Sheng focuses on the intersection between deep learning-based natural language processing and computing systems, with the aim of enabling learning from large-scale language data and making it accessible.
