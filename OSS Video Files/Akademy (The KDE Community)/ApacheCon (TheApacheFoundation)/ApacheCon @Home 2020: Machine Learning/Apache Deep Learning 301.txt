	Apache Deep Learning 301
Timothy Spann

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

In my talk I will discuss and show examples of using Apache Hadoop, Apache Kudu, Apache Flink, Apache Hive, Apache MXNet, Apache OpenNLP, Apache NiFi and Apache Spark for deep learning applications. This is the follow up to previous talks on Apache Deep Learning 101 and 201 at ApacheCon, Dataworks Summit, Strata and other events. As part of my talk I will walk through using Apache MXNet Pre-Built Models, integrating new open source Deep Learning libraries with Python and Java, as well as running real-time AI streams from edge devices to servers utilizing Apache NiFi and Apache NiFi - MiNiFi. This talk is geared towards Data Engineers interested in the basics of architecting Deep Learning pipelines with open source Apache tools in a Big Data environment. I will walk through source code examples available in github and run the code live on Apache NiFi and Apache Flink clusters.
