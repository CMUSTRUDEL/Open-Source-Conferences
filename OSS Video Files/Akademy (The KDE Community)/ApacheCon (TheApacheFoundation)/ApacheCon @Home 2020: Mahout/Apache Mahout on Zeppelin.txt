Description: 
	Apache Mahout on Zeppelin
Andrew Musselman

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

This talk will demonstrate adding a Mahout interpreter to the Zeppelin notebook system. Zeppelin is an extensible notebook project which allows users to add interpreters which will understand and run a wide variety of code, ranging from Python, to Spark-flavored Scala, to SQL dialects, to other domain-specific languages (DSLs). In our case we will add an interpreter which understands the Mahout DSL called Samsara, which focuses on matrix math at scale. The activities in this tutorial will span: (1) Getting the latest software releases (2) Setting environment variables (3) Creating and configuring the Samsara interpreter (4) Starting a notebook and importing a data set (5) Doing some data manipulation and calculation (6) Producing some plots and charts (7) Showing some ways to publish dashboards and individual cells The audience should be prepared with an operating system which has a recent version of Java (greater than jdk 1.8), and an installation script will be provided for people who would like to set a computer up in advance to follow along. This talk is for anyone with an interest in data science and analytics. Blog post with similar previous work/style: https://mahout.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/misc/mahout-in-zeppelin
