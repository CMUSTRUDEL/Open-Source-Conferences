the morning everyone my name is Lee

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,170
Oliveira i'm a co-founder and CTO of

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,990
semantics semantics it is a brazilian

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,080
company was founded in two thousand oh

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,480
seven we work as a be startup in

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
brazil offering professional services

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,189
for companies that need solutions in

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,310
search and big big data specifically

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,340
sold in hadoop we offer training

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,679
consultancy and support for Brazilian

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,570
companies and we have our different

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,910
sorts of customers in this presentation

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,969
here I'm trying to bring you to bring to

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,820
you guys the the most common problem

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,969
that i have found in search including

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,399
search with many many millions of

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,309
documents and sometimes not only

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,850
millions just tens of thousands which

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,980
have some incredible problems with

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,879
relevancy which is one of the most

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,920
important themes in terms of search

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,110
these days my name is Lee Oliveira I

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,570
have 15 years of experience with

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,460
websites and certain genes i got

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,439
specialized in relevancy and semantics

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,119
graduating business management nit

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,159
innovation in brazil so about importance

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,500
of relevancy i think that one were the

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,180
most important things that i have to

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,439
mention is that it is the game changer

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,330
in search before google existed there

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,170
existed are a lot of search engines out

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,119
there altavista even yahoo the game

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,759
changer about google is that it created

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,770
a way of bringing the relevant results

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,880
in the first page which was not really

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,790
common at the time and they found a way

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,070
to do this in an automatic way without

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,079
having people that remaining what's

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,560
relevant or not which is was the game

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,479
changer well relevancy can be achieved

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,270
in through many different types of data

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
you could have cross-reference log

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,619
analysis you could use social media

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,149
market research new ideas about a

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:08,369
product or service and relevancy it's

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,590
good to remember it's all about the user

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,210
you can really have relevancy without

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,550
considering what users

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:18,330
have to say or how they behave in your

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,100
website or your service or software so

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,660
it's not about what we think of the

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,240
users it's about what user is actually

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,960
doing how it is behaving and how he's

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,930
really doing the research and if you

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,420
don't understand your data it's not

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,640
really good to to find what is well

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,580
right so what one good idea here is

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,320
trying to find a full research

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,910
researching user behavior researching

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,160
use your needs you could do is a market

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,870
research or you could just analyze logs

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,430
and see what they're searching what

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,460
you're doing your website where they are

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,370
clicking which filters they use fastest

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,010
and everything this is very important

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,440
and one thing to to remind you about

00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,940
importance of relevancy is that if I

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,920
used to go to your website don't merit

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,110
e-commerce through a document search or

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,450
whatever you have if they don't find

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,460
what they want in your your search

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:13,710
they'll leave and go to another website

00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:15,780
and try to see if they find it so in

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,810
some cases you don't have big data you

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,580
have small data but are like e-commerce

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,220
is you may have tens of thousands of

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,230
products and it's very common to not

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,250
having a resultset so you do a search

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,560
and you get a zero result query so it's

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,410
time to find the right words for the job

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,380
that's where synonym stemming and other

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,150
techniques comes in to search and

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,240
analysis of course understanding or it

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,750
uses is searching for as i said before

00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:48,510
other options sometimes it's very common

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,790
for user to have a typo use google

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,060
notice this a long time ago and solar

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,240
they we have suggestions that could help

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,700
you find right words without giving out

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,290
distill result queries all the time and

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,360
you can create an interface to make

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,700
easier so that users can try different

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,630
keywords to get the results and also

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,910
analyze are all the words that are

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,250
search together by the same users to

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,440
create special suggestions so sometimes

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,160
users will search for phrases and you

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,380
have to figure out which phrases are

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,330
needed to to get results sometimes a

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,550
phrase like a long tail k

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,069
search of a long phrase will get you a

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,539
zero result so sometimes you have to

00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:37,469
create rules to avoid this about

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:40,539
relevancy I have you have some rules

00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:42,610
that are the most forgotten ones in

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,069
projects and absurd applications that

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:49,750
have seen in many websites in Brazil I'm

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:51,430
sure it's the same in many places one of

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,349
the things that we figure out that

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,349
phrases are more relevant than single

00:04:53,349 --> 00:05:01,270
words so single words when someone types

00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:03,490
of phrase they want to see that phrasing

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,900
the result it's not it's right simple

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,690
for you for us to consider this because

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,190
this is common behavior in Google but

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,280
when you set up a search application

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,210
sometimes it is forgotten that how to do

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,949
this and and the best way to do this

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,860
pure words as I say here are which are

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:23,229
words that are not changed by synonyms

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,909
or stamped they are more relevant than

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:29,319
the they stemmed words so you have to

00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:31,270
consider these when building your search

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,690
application to and creating a semantic

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:38,409
relevancy that makes sense for users in

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,560
general in general which is that could

00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:44,650
change in many cases newest documents

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,000
are more relevant than no documents but

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,330
this could be reversed there's an

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,969
example that I worked with it was a

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,050
search of a TV schedule a TV Guide and

00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:59,469
in this case what was not what was the

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,569
let's say the the oldest documents they

00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:04,270
were more relevant that because all the

00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:07,270
dates were in the future so what which

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:12,069
was closer from today was more relevant

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:15,639
than what was closer to tomorrow right

00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:19,389
so this rule could be reversed depending

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,370
on what you're doing and of course this

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,529
day we leave the we live in the time

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,349
when which mobile applications are very

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:27,849
common so close your vendors and

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,099
locations are more relevant and decent

00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:31,629
ones if you have the location of the

00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,849
person that is searching for some

00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,979
information and one of the most

00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:38,139
important things it's giving the right

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,980
way to the right fields and specifically

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,770
if you're using this

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:46,360
magazine sword which is a very common

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,540
solution for search interfaces this

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,280
seems very simple but it's not sometimes

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,140
people forget what's really important

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,530
and give the wrong way to the wrong

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,530
fields so sometimes which is very common

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,810
you have a mix of relevant things in any

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,480
commerce you must consider the freshest

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,180
documents Plus this model across the

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,950
smaller prices and best sellers so we

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,010
have like three variables and you need

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,350
to create sometimes math formula to cope

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,830
with all these items of relevancy that's

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:22,810
tricky because like Amazon you can have

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:25,240
a sort option that's kind of where the

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,200
average boost relevant products actually

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,400
they're doing this its a mix of relevant

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,070
points that they need to figure out

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,260
which is the most most one hundreds and

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,410
of course you can boost each parameters

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:43,000
separately the problem is that when you

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,500
test your formula you very well you must

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,110
test your from us so that you don't

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,770
prioritize one parameter more than the

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:53,280
other so that in some cases after I've

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,080
worked with a job search in Brazil and

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,300
the freshest job ads would be more

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,950
relevant than the holders one rice and I

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,310
in one of the thing that we noticed is

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:07,480
that when we created this ruler to boost

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,370
the most the newest documents sometimes

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,990
you would get irrelevant results just

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,830
because it was a new document so you

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:20,100
need to test to figure out the best

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:26,440
weight of the date and also the semantic

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:31,060
relevancy now in terms of relevancy and

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:34,090
waiting when you use this max which is a

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,520
very common solution you have two main

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,500
options in solar which is the query

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,580
field and the phrase field key wife and

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,020
PF well as i said before phrase fields

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,510
should have bigger weights they know of

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,100
your query field this is a something

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,870
that that's not really

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,399
common when you start seeing search

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,060
applications out there which should be

00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:00,959
but anyway few weights must be decided

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,170
carefully you can use a scale I love

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:08,360
Fibonacci numbers so I try to use it I

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:11,760
scale out to to prioritize the most

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,959
important fields and there isn't an

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,230
example here like of a movies website

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:22,800
like IMDb movie name would be the most

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,769
relevant field because possibly if you

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,399
analyze the behavior of the users in

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:31,140
IMDb like in theory you'd see that

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,820
people search the most foreign movie

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:39,540
names so this is a an example that in

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:43,320
phrase fields you get a weight of 34 and

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,959
then actors 21 director 13 that means

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,190
that i'm doing the fibonacci scale here

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:52,880
i reversed and actuary fields i'm using

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,940
the same fields but with lower weights

00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,690
so that when someone searches for a

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,800
phrase a name of a movie there is a

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:09,230
phrase it will get relevant and you'll

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,959
be on the top first page the top result

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:16,950
and now i want to discuss a little bit

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,220
of all synonyms and in terms of synonyms

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:24,149
it is very important that we discuss the

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:28,079
synonyms fury vs cinnamons in search i

00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:31,399
worked with a company in Brazil that

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,399
they were building a huge synonym file

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:38,449
for all of the the keywords it didn't

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:43,399
make any sense because they were using a

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:45,959
the serosa a dictionary of synonyms and

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,970
the rebuilding a huge thing like you

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,070
just kept buying all the the dead

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,010
synonyms but it doesn't make sense in

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,800
search and I'll explain why well in

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,060
theory a synonym is a word having the

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,000
same or nearly the same meaning as

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,040
another in the language as happy joyful

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,509
elated

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,190
so it also it could be a word or

00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:12,759
expression accept it as another name for

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:16,790
something right okay but in search well

00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,709
synonyms can get complicated sometimes

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,170
you don't need to use only real synonyms

00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:23,779
only synonyms that could be explained

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,630
like synonyms in a dictionary sometimes

00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,880
you must focus on user needs right so

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,860
it's not a good idea to use the sorors

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,279
it's a good idea to find synonyms

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:38,000
through analyzing user behavior

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,350
analyzing what are your top 100 keywords

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,019
that are being searched in your website

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:46,040
or application and then figuring out

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:48,800
sometimes you have channelized also your

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,160
top 100 keywords there are returning

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,769
zero results because then you could

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,620
actually see what you need to actually

00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,500
use a synonym that would make sense

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,810
right also you could use it for your

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,600
other useful stuff like you could use it

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,690
for common typos that could be corrected

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,920
we're using synonyms or even unrelated

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,930
words that could do the job for you and

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,790
sometimes you need to get creative you

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,579
just need to figure out a way of using

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,010
synonyms even if words that doesn't make

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:23,510
sense but that doesn't make sense in the

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,110
configuration of course when you see it

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,670
but in the application it makes sense so

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,610
you need to figure out these situations

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,829
in order to use it we talked about

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,220
synonyms there are two things you have

00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:39,920
to consider the first one are one-way

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,959
transformations then I call one-way

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,839
transformations no one really call it

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,510
away but uh I figure out that it's best

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,970
you two to do it it explain with an

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:53,720
example here I have a simple one like if

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:56,000
you have a website and people search a

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,949
lot of for the word computer and then

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,709
sometimes it's a typo date missile a

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:02,509
letter like counter and it's a very

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:05,810
common mistake and you figure this out

00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:08,329
through analysis you could easily create

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,690
a one-way transformation and comforter

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:14,960
to computer

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:18,260
sometimes this requires expansion which

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,420
is something I discuss later in our

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,280
setup will set a few type here I'll show

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,330
you guys a few type that I have created

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,700
in for our customer and 442 customers

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,470
actually that makes sense in this

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,200
situation so that you can really

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:38,480
simplify the way you control synonyms

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:41,510
because it's very hard to to keep and

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,260
maintain a single synonyms file with all

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,210
the transformations on one-way inch away

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,910
so I have created a few type in which is

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,060
separate the one-way transformations

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,150
from the to a transformations like to

00:13:53,060 --> 00:14:00,130
weigh it will be something like this

00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:02,300
example computer pc mac notebook server

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,080
that could be used in a website that

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,740
sells computers for instance normally it

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,480
requires expansion so it use this

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,830
synonym filter with the option expand

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,170
equals true and sometimes you don't use

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,950
exact synonyms for instance brand names

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,800
and other view words can be used in this

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,510
index example mac is a brand name but it

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:32,150
could be a synonym of computer in some

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:34,010
case in e-commerce for instance and it's

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,990
hard to configure in maintaining one-way

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,690
and two-way in single surnames file so i

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,820
will discuss this later as i get back to

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,500
it so let's talk a little bit about

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,890
other problem which is very common in

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,620
terms of synonyms index time versus

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,320
query time normally people want to use

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,930
synonyms in query time that is when

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,360
someone searched for something so it

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,390
would get that's that that's that word

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,350
that's been searched and then transform

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,990
it during search into another search

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,830
with the synonyms and then try to search

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:13,670
that okay that works in some cases it

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,680
don't that just doesn't work when a

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,410
simple exception that i'm using here is

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,440
when you use like photo album together

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,690
in photo album separated as a sin

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,990
this is a huge problem when we use

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,530
you're using an inquiry time only

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,390
because this would probably break up the

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,900
request handler and would generate a

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:40,640
query string that doesn't make any sense

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:43,350
so when you want to use a phrase synonym

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,630
this might require an index time sternum

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:51,450
to work correctly the index time synonym

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,850
is useful for search also in some

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,370
situations like normally it's very

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,790
common to use a filter in solar called

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:02,300
word delimiter and it has many rules of

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:06,060
which symbols could be considered a

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,570
delimiter so sometimes it this would

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:13,440
break some searches such as C++ or

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:15,270
dotnet and you could use a simple

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,490
solution using single synonyms in the

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,620
next time to convert these two other

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,330
strings and then you wouldn't have

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,110
problem when you search for this for

00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:28,710
this in these cases you have to keep in

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,480
mind that this index time 5 will have

00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,780
the exceptions they don't work well in

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,410
curry time and then again when you talk

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:41,730
about relevancy synonyms testing and

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:44,640
search this requires a lot of testing

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,460
now this is a problem because people

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,800
love developing new things but you know

00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,950
they don't really like testing all the

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,040
time and doing a very durable testing we

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,839
are testing with analyzing first getting

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,520
a report of what are the most common

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:06,390
keywords being searched and then really

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:09,420
creating a test model that it could

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,730
actually really go word by word testing

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,650
it and see what's happening and not only

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,449
testing with the words that you think

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,420
they are important but actually testing

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,829
it with words that users are using your

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,319
in your website in your search

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:26,400
application so you have to keep in mind

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,500
that to get your mind which synonyms you

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,990
use in the next time and seeing them is

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,850
that you use query time we require you

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,650
that you do a lot of testing to figure

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:40,770
out the best way of using the

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:43,220
so some examples here is that is a very

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:47,930
common like engineer engineer engineer

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:51,830
which is a one-way typo engineer

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:55,020
engineering it's a two-way this is a

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:58,790
something that was very common in a job

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,790
website that I have done in the past

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:32,370
yeah well in my experience we've done

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,880
this specifically engineer engineer is a

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,600
very uh this is a case that I've studied

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,340
because I've done this bill in the past

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,140
it's two things you have to analyze the

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,820
behavior but you also have to know what

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,450
you have in your data and what is your

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,820
formula like in job websites we did our

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,190
research and eighty percent of the

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:58,470
searches are job titles well okay but uh

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,590
engineer is a common word in a job title

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,990
but engineering it's not right

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:08,370
engineering would be a common word in a

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,170
job description text okay so normally

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,450
your formula would have job title and

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,260
job description in your main formula in

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,870
your qf and PF fields so we figure out

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,680
that in some cases like people would be

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:28,920
searching for let's say one of those

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:31,680
very hard an electronic engineer in a

00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,410
place that doesn't exist a lot of

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,130
electronic engineer job so this will

00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:40,980
normally get you zero result queries and

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,860
when you use engineer with engineering

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,960
it makes sense because you have that

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,029
wording job description is very common

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,309
so it's not only about knowing

00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,259
the user behavior but I need to know

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,659
what are you have in your data what is

00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,809
common in your text in your text fields

00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:01,399
and to figure this out one thing that

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:05,039
you could do is actually using an

00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:07,109
anonymous to such as Hadoop or with big

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,269
and hive which analyzed your big logs

00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:11,999
that sometimes you just can't analyze it

00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:15,119
easily or other thing that you could do

00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:16,889
which is very common its try to save

00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,929
this information to a database when

00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:22,979
people are searching it and then trying

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:26,070
to do queries on it to figure out what

00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:29,190
is going on there all the and you could

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,039
do that in real time or not you could

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,609
analyze it in many ways one most common

00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,499
thing that is very common to do is do a

00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,719
weekly analysis of what's being searched

00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:41,999
and then figuring out the best way to

00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:44,609
figure the synonyms and of course you

00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:46,919
can have lots of in this case you could

00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:51,210
have other solutions even in some cases

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,489
at the Saros is helpful but it's not

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,440
really the most common way I'd say it's

00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:57,409
the best because you could create a

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,749
synonym that doesn't exist in your data

00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:02,580
so doesn't makes any sense so you need

00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:06,119
to actually figure out which words make

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,149
sense and test them all the time and see

00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,219
if that result is still relevant because

00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:13,259
another problem that's very common here

00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,820
it's good at you ask is that you could

00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:17,969
create a synonym that could make your

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,460
search very irrelevant so you must take

00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:24,929
care with this because this is a very

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,729
common problem in Brazil there's a job

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,539
title called controller then you your

00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:33,210
family you notice this word but uh in

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:36,839
Portuguese even in English you could say

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,789
that there is a very common keyword that

00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,070
that it appears a lot in job

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,460
descriptions it's controlling or control

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:48,450
so when you use this steamer controller

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,519
could become control so you need to

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,399
figure out the relevancy so that it

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,379
doesn't make like when you look for

00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,960
controller it brings a lot of results

00:21:55,379 --> 00:22:00,260
about people who have to control finance

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,440
or control

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,440
servers control teams doesn't make any

00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,300
sense so you need to figure out our

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,730
words in your data and test it all the

00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,720
time this is very important other

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:18,090
example as I told before computer pc mac

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,330
he next time the examples that I've

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:24,420
shown you see sharp and net that's okay

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,700
but one of the things that I have had

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,970
problems in the past it was with human

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,610
resources and HR in Brazil we have

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,450
similar situation for this word and

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:39,780
phrase a lot of people would do would

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,060
put the job title as HR analyst another

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,480
one would be more complete and say human

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,130
resources analyst and that synonym was

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,280
something that was very important for

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:53,130
the website but you wouldn't work if you

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,080
do it in quite a time so we had to do it

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,720
in index time and then it worked very

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,120
well and it could and solve the problems

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,220
when you're doing a search business

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,010
intelligence and bi is also a very

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,400
common one and CRM customer relationship

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:11,070
management is also very common one in

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,020
jobs up in job websites so in bring it

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,450
is this case these are real cases do you

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,500
examples of your world that view

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,540
problems right so this is the kind of

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,220
thing that I want to share you guys so

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,010
that you when you fall into these

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:32,730
problems you can actually take the right

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:34,020
decisions so just so well that I don't

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,230
know if you can read them very well but

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,900
I have created a few type a sort of a

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,840
few type that works with semantic

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,330
relevancy this is the whole field type

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,680
it is very hard to see I divided into

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,940
here the first the index part so one of

00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,400
the things that I want to talk about

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,730
this field time period of course so text

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,530
Portuguese and why I'm talking about

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,690
portuguese here even though we are in

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:03,450
America this is very important right

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,850
Portuguese is a is a language that as

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,510
many other languages in the world has

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:13,800
grafico accents such as German French

00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:17,340
Spanish and this requires some special

00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,080
attention of the way that and the order

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:24,030
of the futures and the way that you

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,430
configure it is so first I must mention

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,830
that it's very normal to use a white

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,080
space tokenizer in this case and not the

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,990
standard tokenizer because the standard

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,730
tokenizer would normally break the words

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:38,430
with symbols too and this could be a

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:41,220
problem so we'd rather break the words

00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:45,300
with another future that's called were

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,800
delimiter that we're using now here one

00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,670
of the first things that we have to

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:54,450
worry about is this top filter stock

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:57,350
future is very important for to avoid a

00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:01,560
lot of keywords that are not relevant

00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:03,330
prepositions it depends in many cases in

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,220
too many cases you have to determine

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,250
what's relevant or not but you know

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,080
preposition some verbs some words that

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,180
doesn't make any sense to index all

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,180
these words in this order in this type

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:18,960
of field and then we're talking about

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,420
index time here we can create a use

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:27,000
synonym future factory and use it a

00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:29,370
synonyms index time file and then we

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,190
could go for the word the limiter which

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:35,160
will break the words we're using a lot

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:39,240
of lots of symbols such as dashes plus

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:42,180
signs iPhones and many other things and

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,960
then finally you would have the

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,480
lowercase right and the last two this is

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,440
very important to mention this stammer

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,650
and ask for the future factory is about

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,600
removing the graphical accent so this is

00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,000
also very important because a common

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,490
mistake with these languages is that

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,790
some people would use this statement

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,170
after removing the graphical accents

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:11,100
that's a common mistake if you go

00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:15,180
through the STEMI algorithms that they

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:17,370
exist in many languages you see that

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,610
they consider the gráfico accents to do

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,750
the stemming in Portuguese this was a

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:25,000
problem we were doing this mistake

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,420
and there were a lot of relevant results

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,340
because of that so it's very important

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,580
to remember that this stammer always

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:37,540
considered grafico accents so you must

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,820
really use the stammer before removing

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,610
the graphical accents this is very

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:46,330
important and the experience that I

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:49,750
wanted to share if you guys so the same

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:53,860
field type in quite a time a little bit

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:56,890
different we begin with the stock future

00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,520
factory of course and then would use a

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:03,580
synonym future factory twice the first

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,410
one for Corrections and the second one

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,400
for expansions that are the recall

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:12,900
expansion so why is this well imagine

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:17,080
that you have like a sad computer copter

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,840
computer you need you to transform

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,900
compter into computer right that's okay

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,380
but imagine that you also need to expand

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,720
computer to PC Mac and server so if you

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,930
do this in a single file you'd have to

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,630
configure for each word many many times

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:37,750
the same thing you'd be very confusing

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,810
to maintain that so we figure out this

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,670
way you could actually at first correct

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,610
the words that you need to correct or

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:48,130
transform and then expand them so that

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:51,940
you don't lose a lot of time maintaining

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:56,170
these synonyms files which is actually a

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:59,320
problem I would say it is a pain whether

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,750
it's it's actually a very hurtful when

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,810
you have a big synonym file and it

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:08,650
becomes unmanageable so you really need

00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:12,600
to figure out a way to do this without

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,250
really spending a lot of time

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:20,980
configuring a lot lots of different

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:22,860
files or a huge txt file of synonyms not

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,590
a good idea so this is a good way of

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,390
simplifying things and then in the end

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,820
you'd have the same things the lower k

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:34,650
is the brazilian stem and they ask for

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:41,140
the future which removes gráfico accents

00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:43,600
now another thing that is important to

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,040
mention here as I said before which is

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,970
one of the most important relevant

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:52,570
relevancy rules it's about having a sort

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,340
of i call pure here but it's having a

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,610
sort of a feel that you could use it as

00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:02,620
a copy field in solar that is a field

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:04,990
that would have the same values but they

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,820
would have different futures that it

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,160
could actually use this in order to

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,110
figure out relevancy and semantic

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:18,130
relevancy so this is a very simple thing

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:21,160
to do because this pure text field

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:25,210
wouldn't use synonyms wouldn't use

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:28,750
stammer and it will have in any would

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,790
also it could not even use stop stop

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,760
words you could just drop stop words to

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,340
in this case in this example I kept stop

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,440
words it's very common to remove stop

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,060
words for the pure fill in this case

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,750
you're indexing the information you only

00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,690
do in the lower case and the ASCII

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:53,740
folding filter to remove gráfico accents

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:55,570
just to make it a playing with other

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,000
keywords that you are indexing and then

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,700
avoiding the zero result queries because

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,390
someone is using capital letters so you

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,830
need to really put it on water case and

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,590
avoid stammers and synonyms and

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:12,930
sometimes even avoid the stop filter so

00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:17,260
why is this well as I told you before

00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:19,900
the what you exact words that users are

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,010
searching are more relevant than the

00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:29,260
same words the stamp or with synonyms so

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:31,420
if you create this this pure field let's

00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,210
say pure that you don't change its you

00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,220
think a little bit just to conform to

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:42,100
your search you're able to actually

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:45,460
create a semantic relevancy if a very

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:48,760
simple way using these max or eegees max

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:52,520
with the newest version of solar

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:56,990
okay so practically imagine that you

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,080
have a field named product name okay so

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,909
that you keep the search result

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,820
systematically relevant you would need a

00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:08,350
product name field of course and also

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:12,429
let's call it a product name pure right

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:15,650
which is a copy field of product name

00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:17,720
well let's keep in mind also that

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:22,909
phrases are also more relevant in each

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:25,010
with the words so in solar config which

00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:30,559
is the file that defines you can define

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:32,690
a standard key a qf and PF you have the

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,220
query fields for single words the

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:40,700
product name pure would need to have a

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:43,370
bigger wait then product name any phrase

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,919
fields the same thing but both fields

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:48,590
would have more weight than the query

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:55,090
fields so this is a very common setup

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:59,140
and it works and it's very good but then

00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,460
what will you get with that well

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,520
relevant results which is what you're

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:07,880
looking for now users we understand the

00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,460
results and synonyms or stem and tokens

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,510
won't disturb or create noise which is

00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:17,240
very important and this way you'll be

00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,980
doing a search that is similar to what

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,110
the main search websites are doing

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,779
including Google which is actually the

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,850
expected behavior every user that goes

00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:28,220
to your website your web sites not

00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:31,700
Google but they expect you to behave

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,880
like Google so this is a way to simulate

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:39,620
this and create the situation

00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,600
specifically a with keyword search and

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,779
especially in document search e-commerce

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,130
internet search library search all the

00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:52,460
situations a bookstore search you

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,799
benefit from that and you'd be able to

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,750
find relevant results even in a scenario

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,710
where with millions or billions of

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:02,330
documents or a small data to which

00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,880
important to mention and very common

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:08,059
situation I also like to add I don't

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,950
have a slide for this that sometimes you

00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:14,990
need to have as i said before other

00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:18,230
variables that would be interesting for

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:20,510
relevancy and then sometimes you need to

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:23,929
get a little bit creative because you

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,480
should have you could have some sort

00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:29,270
fields or boost fields they do need to

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,850
add and this booth fields would be lets

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,909
say in the case that you need the

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,240
freshest documents you need a date so

00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,820
that you can actually calculate if it's

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,760
closer to two days i really like that

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,630
you're doing your search or not or you

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,029
could have a job position a gel location

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:53,510
so that you could actually find the

00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:55,730
distance and boost by distance to get

00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:58,669
the closest venues and locations in

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:01,520
situations that you have mabob you

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:04,159
searched locations or you could just

00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:09,169
have something totally different and get

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,030
creative do a lot of math sometimes

00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:13,550
people think well search is all about

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,339
words know is sometimes a lot about a

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,899
lot of time it is about numbers and you

00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,940
have to figure out which numbers are

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:24,830
imported in HK is if you do any commerce

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:27,980
price is a number the numbers of sales

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:32,030
is a number the number of times that

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:35,929
people click in in a product is a number

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:39,800
right and say mean semantics we are

00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:41,629
partners with lucid works the like for

00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,419
instance in lucid work search this

00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:50,659
application that lucid works has that

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:53,119
they even have a cliq boost right like

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,700
you have to win boost of what's being

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,950
click the most but you could be get

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:01,220
creative it not only click the most but

00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:03,500
like if you have a space where user can

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,630
write reviews you could use the review

00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,660
the most you could use the the best

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,460
stats in terms of the reviews like the

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,960
products that have five stars are more

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,720
relevant than products that have only

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,910
three or two stars or you

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,420
could get really creative and and try to

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:22,700
figure out a mix of all these things

00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:26,780
let's say makeup I'm sorry I'm Brazilian

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,580
I move my hands here so you could do

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,330
excuse a mix of information that might

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:35,900
be useful for your job for for the wait

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:38,480
are you doing searches anyway as we like

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:41,570
to think in semantics there are infinite

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,030
possibilities in terms of search you

00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:47,450
need to find the best possibilities for

00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:49,550
your business and sometimes as Search

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,010
application developers it is something

00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:55,130
that I have to tell you guys sometimes

00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:58,040
you need to get out of the computer

00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,480
software development world and

00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,460
understand a little bit more about the

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,290
business world and there's a little bit

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:09,130
more about the way users behave and they

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:12,920
still a lot about usability user

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:15,680
experience even though this might not

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,830
have be your specialty where me to

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:25,160
figure out these kind of things to

00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:27,950
produce the best results I'd love to get

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,230
in touch with you guys and also if you

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,170
have questions we have I thanked 9

00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,530
minutes and thank you very much for

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,530
being here

00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,569
in some cases that's fairly

00:36:47,890 --> 00:37:00,069
straightforward say you were testing a

00:36:49,569 --> 00:37:02,920
presentation this user like the favorite

00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:05,140
of these movies at mental xev those my

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,420
recommendation engine giving half of

00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,859
those get the other that's that's one

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,200
technique in and you're fortunate to

00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:20,530
have that data that works what about the

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:21,940
other yeah well dusty is very hard one

00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,520
of the things that I also always

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,730
recommend is that you get very familiar

00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,950
familiarized with the debug mode so that

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,690
you can actually check how the scores

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:34,780
being calculated with your formulas

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,630
which is very tough and in difficult to

00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,869
figure out sometimes but a one testing

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:43,450
technique that I like I believe which

00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:45,579
should be the most common ones is try to

00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:48,910
to use your software the way the user

00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:51,510
would use right try not to test as a

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:55,210
developer like test straight into Seoul

00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:58,619
try to check the way the users are

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:01,329
seeing this data and see it makes sense

00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:04,809
why I'm telling you this this is a good

00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:07,420
story in the past we'd we used to test

00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:10,000
only using solar application the bug

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,460
right and then suddenly we'd figure out

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,230
that what we are seeing in our test had

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,329
much better results than what we were

00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,309
seeing the website and then we figure

00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,710
out that actually what was going on is

00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:26,619
that the front-end developers they

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:29,079
somehow tweaked the solar variables and

00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:31,630
they were just I'm sorry buddy with a

00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:33,670
screening up relevancy so it's not

00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,619
really it's important that you test as

00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,450
the user will do this is one thing that

00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:39,400
I always mentioned for developers

00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,859
because we're so used to test as

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,140
developers that we totally forget about

00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:46,480
the business another testing technique

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,579
that I think that is important and also

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,599
is important for business is not only

00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:55,329
having technical guys testing so it's

00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,609
good for any company it's good to have a

00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:00,970
product person

00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:03,309
that would be sharing this testing tasks

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:06,819
with you guys because it's good to have

00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:08,140
different eyes in the same subject it's

00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:10,539
important that you don't have only

00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,970
technical people testing because our

00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:15,039
testing is biased I am technically I'm

00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,680
technical to you so our testing are

00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:21,160
biased we tend to think that we're right

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:25,569
why we might be wrong so it's a good to

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:28,390
have different types of people of

00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:33,099
different backgrounds to test that I

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:37,359
also i think it is important to get

00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:40,960
creative with testing to make tests as

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:45,220
part of the job right create a task for

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,319
testing so not doing tests as okay now i

00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,930
need to test now it's not in the project

00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,079
let's skip that now you need to really

00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:55,390
have it as part of the project as you

00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,279
lose a lot of time testing normally you

00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,249
lose more time testing than actually

00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:05,739
developing is the solution so it is a

00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:08,680
good thing and finally in the end of

00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:11,980
this offer when the product is finally

00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:16,349
let's say ready to go to production it

00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,999
is very good that you do the let's say

00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:20,920
when you don't have the user behavior

00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,690
yet like you're doing a new thing and

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,509
you don't have you don't know the user

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,789
behavior right but actually you've done

00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:29,980
a lot of testing before putting the user

00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:31,779
behavior going going there right so one

00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:35,980
thing that i recommend which something

00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:39,130
that worked for us is actually save the

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,349
logs of your internal testing to retest

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,569
before going to production because

00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:45,309
normally you could find other things

00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:49,829
that you didn't see so these are the

00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,829
things that i recommend okay

00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:10,190
he would try to take them to another

00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:14,060
language using the techniques good

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:16,930
question very common morning job in jobs

00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,820
job websites in specifically in Brazil

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,370
many terminal companies that work there

00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:25,160
they would advertise their jobs in

00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:28,400
English so it would be very common to

00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:34,100
have a situation in which someone would

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:36,850
look for let's say i'll try to dating I

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:40,420
can't even even example for you guys

00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,420
let's see here

00:41:49,869 --> 00:42:01,069
if the wireless works all right it

00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:04,009
worked so this is one of the job sites

00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:06,799
job websites that I have developed all

00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:10,579
in Portuguese but i think the search bar

00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:13,670
is universal so it's very common to have

00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:15,230
a situation in which in job titles that

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:18,619
you'll have it in english or portuguese

00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:22,160
so project manager in portuguese is gng

00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:25,720
projects it's similar words with a

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,299
little bit differently so we'd have a

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:34,130
synonym for manager another one for

00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:36,289
project right so also this is also a

00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,930
good example on how you can do with

00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:46,819
synonyms in the UI so the users don't

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:49,150
get confused i'm sure you guys the wine

00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:49,150
is work

00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:59,040
alright so here there you go you have

00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,360
the results for change into pajamas it

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:08,130
brings out 206 results if you look here

00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:10,620
on the right you know cutter uses this

00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,390
because sometimes these things we're

00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:16,500
looking for something you find different

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:19,380
way so here they show that gen eight

00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,470
equals to G store which is a similar

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,360
many Portuguese and also manager so

00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,700
we're doing it settled into two

00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,410
different languages it's very common to

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:35,310
have the job type in english and also

00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:38,400
projects because product right also let

00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:40,440
me see if this is going to work the

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,420
relevancy formula will have the same

00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,290
concept that i have told you guys here

00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:50,220
so that if i if i look for the first

00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:53,730
result was generally projects but if i

00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:58,080
look for project manager what will

00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,820
happen let's see the first one the

00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,940
entity project is a little bit different

00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:08,330
but let's see if we can find one in

00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:11,570
English here now look at this time

00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:15,770
there you go project manager so it's

00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:18,980
relevant but since this job as they are

00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:21,320
newest you can see oh she posted a

00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,170
record so these are more relevant

00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,930
because of the date but we can also pick

00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:32,630
a project manager here not so fresh but

00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:39,190
it's relevant it is here so if we come

00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:39,190
back to the other search again you see

00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:46,640
that that project manager won't appear

00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,220
as the 4th result anymore you have

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,990
another change the projects why because

00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,630
we're trying to have the situation in

00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,430
which like imagine that you are foreign

00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:58,010
person in Brazil and you look for things

00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,630
in English because you want to work and

00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,770
environment that people speak English

00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,190
all the time you're not used to

00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:06,200
Portuguese right so if the person certs

00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:09,350
in English would get the most relevant

00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,180
results in English first because we are

00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,790
always considering that what the user

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,480
types is more relevant than what you're

00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:19,670
doing it for words so this is a way to

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:25,070
take care of these situations in which

00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:30,560
you might have a multilingual documents

00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:32,360
right it is important in solar also this

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,490
finished solar also has a language

00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,560
detection so you could use language

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:41,290
detection from solar to determine which

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,290
