hi all of your faces look very familiar

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,309
so there might be some stuff I'm just

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,929
going to skip over considering you guys

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,360
have probably had enough of the

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,370
introduction to ODT even though I do

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,160
have slides you could feel free to look

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,330
at today my talk will focus on the

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,070
balance framework and will be the

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,230
overview we kind of will skip through

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,500
we'll talk about why we actually

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,029
developed balance framework and then

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,759
what struggles we went through how we

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,350
handle them and then what it actually is

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,579
and how it's been implemented just a

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,550
overview of the architecture and then

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,410
i'll be giving a demonstration of how to

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,300
install it and configure it for yourself

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,750
you guys are more than welcome to follow

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,100
along i'll be giving instructions and so

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,930
it originally started at NASA Jet

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
Propulsion Laboratory with the funding

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,100
of the from this office of space science

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,460
in 1998 and the software that we created

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,379
was to read it was for us to reduce the

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,700
redundancy of like developing the same

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,060
thing over and over for most of the

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,270
mission so we just made a general one

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,229
that has had highly configurable

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,330
components that are obviously connected

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,840
that you could go through and just

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:23,189
choose what fits into your project most

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,409
easily and how it works best here's ODT

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,240
at Apache I think everyone's already

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,009
gone over this so I'm just going to skip

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,770
through it okay and what it is it's a

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,000
software with components that facilitate

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,509
the rabbit construction of robust

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,640
software systems and it's it's a it's

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,070
for large-scale data management so it's

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,990
those as i said the loosely components

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,490
that we the loosely connected components

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,670
that we have just gives you a lot of

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,009
flexibility i'll be focusing on two of

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,810
the components that we have that we have

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,189
created modules for actually in the

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,110
balance framework which is the file

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,920
manager that there's a data management

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,369
so it tracks all your data the metadata

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,649
and the files you have and then the

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,959
workflow manager which does all the

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,340
pipelining and I think Chris gave a

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,900
really good detail

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:20,769
information about that so what we have

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,290
for balance is an interface that you

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:25,330
don't have to use command lines to get

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,940
in touch with an interface with the

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,840
backend components so it's it's also

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,239
very reusable that you could seamlessly

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,440
get it mitigates these issues of

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,670
seamlessly getting it part of your

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,700
website and configures to what you need

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,329
very easily so we thought of creating

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,370
this framework which we call balance it

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,970
supports reuse provides a common modular

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,329
code phase and it's very configurable so

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,980
you could go into the back end and just

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,739
configure to set it to a certain port

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,840
and you could do the same thing it's

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,860
very it kind of mirrors what the back

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,010
end does for the front end so what is

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,220
balance it provides a common called code

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,440
base to quickly implement your own PHP

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,170
applications if need be it's a great

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:23,139
interface to the ODT core services and

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,579
we we were in a in at NASA Jet

00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,530
Propulsion Laboratory we were actually

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,970
dealing with a lot of missions that were

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,549
fast paced on this fast paced

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,950
environment where you have to set up a

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,200
bunch of websites for different projects

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,760
instead of like having to do the same

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,989
thing over and over again just to reduce

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,720
that constant repetition of tasks we

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,970
made a file manager of we made up sorry

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,599
about that a framework for us to just

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,389
easily implement and just configure to

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,639
your own needs and it's really easy to

00:03:52,389 --> 00:04:00,130
install and maintain we use pear to do

00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:03,459
that oh and it creates a standard

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:08,980
environment that's what our main goal

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:11,859
was to easily connect and so it all

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,859
counts on the it all counts on that

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:18,459
environment that we set up so it just

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:21,789
makes it easy for you to get things

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:25,510
started and move on through move through

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:27,790
it so you could have implementations

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,130
for authentication providers or

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:34,750
authorization providers some data

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,060
management providers and next I'll

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,340
giving you a brief overview of what the

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,860
application skeleton is so this is kind

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,200
of what we standardized also for it's

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,650
just very organized and it's the same

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,790
format for even the modules that we have

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:55,300
sup some people might call extensions so

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:58,690
it's it encourages the rapid development

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,680
also for us when you have a standard

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,930
clean design we have the modules I'll

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,360
talk more about this later but it has

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,680
the same exact format as the application

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,040
skeleton so it has the same classes

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,620
directory modules script static so it

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,870
just makes it easy to go back and find

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,870
what you need for a specific module or

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,300
even your application in general we have

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,140
a static directory where all your

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,120
resources would go such as images jquery

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,280
libraries or even something like Twitter

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,510
bootstrap library that you could add on

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,550
and we have views um where you could

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:43,180
really obviously put most of your views

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:45,520
in so that's the PHP code so we have a

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,880
common directory to which I should

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,710
mention that it's for all your code such

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,810
as headers and footers that you would

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,130
follow along with and we have a config

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,990
file where all your configurations would

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,120
go I think I briefly mentioned this your

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,920
modules directory has this too so to

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,290
configure each module you have your own

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,660
configuration file and this kind of

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,580
organizes it because in the beginning we

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,340
started out with having just one config

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,500
file for an application and it sort of

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,200
got messy so we decided to have each

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,830
module have its own config dot ini file

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,990
just makes it more readable and the main

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,630
index dot PHP file is actually what

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,450
kicks off the balance bootstrap so it

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,090
starts the hair package that you install

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:35,680
it starts that off so the balance

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:38,410
library consists of the balance core

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,600
it has interfaces to get into the

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,639
balance quarters four main applications

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,970
we have an application class which is

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,940
the main class and this has utility

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,970
methods and functions that provide all

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,400
the functionality across the website we

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,850
have the request class it's the method

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,289
for interpreting and processing a

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:03,130
request that you send in so it takes the

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:05,770
URI and takes it into segments and

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,509
deciphers what you are looking for and

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,599
directs you to exactly that directory

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,729
and displays it our response class is

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,789
what does dynamic constructing of the

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:18,789
website so if within your code somewhere

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,220
you dynamically realize that you need to

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,930
add a certain JavaScript or a certain

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,090
CSS file that's where you would do that

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,830
and it gets processed in the response

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:32,500
class and the data class it's it's not

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,690
used directly but it's very usable if

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,389
you needed in your own specific example

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,120
it's it provides a standard response

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:44,260
object for you to send from page to page

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,240
and we have interfaces and

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,190
authentication provider authorization

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,250
provider data provider and a widget

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,810
provider an example of authentication

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,840
provider is our ldap authentication

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,120
interface so that easily you could just

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,940
put in your own configuration so what

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,729
host and port your LDAP is located and

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,110
plug it into your website and one of the

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:12,849
modules we have that I'll discuss

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,289
further uses that the reason why we

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:17,770
separated authentication and

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,750
authorization was due to allowing the

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,210
user to login as separate from allowing

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,940
the user to view certain metadata fields

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,759
for example in the file manager so it

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,409
we've constricted it to certain groups

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,700
that could view it so we've given the

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:37,839
user the option to do that the the data

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,270
and widget provider it's the data

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,240
provider is so if you have a for example

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:46,209
of something that you're connecting to

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,540
it standardizes the way you would

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,360
connect to certain things and retrieve

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,800
so if you have an inner website that

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,829
displays certain things from you let's

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,320
say your MongoDB you could easily plug

00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:01,199
in using this interfaces that we have

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,209
set up let's say a MySQL database and

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:05,660
just easily switch from one to the other

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,529
and it just gives you that flexibility

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,560
widgets are something that you could

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:13,800
actually put into any of your page if

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,230
you're actually using let's say a

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,470
navigation bar that's going to be

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,569
implemented in multiple pages so it's

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:24,050
easy to just put in all your pages that

00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:27,240
that's like where we got the widget from

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,670
i'll be starting on the installation and

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,899
demonstration of the installation

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,310
demonstration and i'm going to show you

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,660
how easy and quickly you could do it

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,370
you're more than welcome to follow on

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,870
your own so we've already installed a

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,399
pair of package so i just want to give a

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,259
brief overview about it we have there's

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,329
an issue with the channel but there's a

00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,459
workaround it and only four lines of

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:52,769
code as you can see just check it out

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,660
get into the directory pair package it

00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:59,959
and do a pseudo install and you could

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,959
get the environment going okay

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,190
isn't Kristin

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,930
look okay yeah

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:45,749
ok

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:50,639
does that work for you guys it looks

00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:53,939
okay alright so as I showed earlier this

00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,449
is the skeleton that we have for the

00:10:53,939 --> 00:11:02,339
balance framework so we have our classes

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:05,160
so to give you a brief overview of what

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,540
we have in here so in here we would have

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,889
like a footer and header like I said

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,919
common things that would go through out

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:15,269
the website errors pages so in the

00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,819
config Dada and I when you first check

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,709
out the code you would go to find site

00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:22,230
root and it gives you a lot of detail on

00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,689
the config configuration file it already

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,970
gives you details of how to install most

00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:31,079
of these things but just to give you a

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,910
slight demo what I called my folder was

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,069
Apache con so I'm to configure data and

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,109
I go change that if you want to point to

00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,759
different directory for example for your

00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:40,999
views you're more than welcome to end

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,859
this is where you would configure that

00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:47,879
next is your header file path you have

00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:51,389
the up the benefit of naming anything

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:53,279
you'd like to these files also so if you

00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,999
want to call head or something else you

00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,419
have that opportunity to do that here

00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:02,249
then we go to the htaccess file which

00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:09,419
most of you should know if you guys are

00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:11,040
at patchy right the HTTP so you go to

00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:16,410
your rewrite base and then do the same

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:18,329
thing here just to let your let you know

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,889
where you're going to your website so

00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,619
this is what it looks like once you set

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,299
that up and i want to show you how easy

00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,279
it is to add your own skin i actually

00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:30,169
downloaded something earlier online and

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,089
just put it in my statics directory and

00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:36,139
called it a travel skin because it's for

00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:43,910
a travel blog and what it includes is

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:43,910
images a style dot CSS file so once I

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:52,269
take the header for that and put it in

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:56,279
my main or actually I could you use the

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:56,279
config file and just point to that

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,370
I config

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,769
now

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:23,200
exactly yeah so you you could easily add

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,330
your own skin it's very simple to do so

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,190
I mean that's what the balance framework

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,310
is based around to make it really easy

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:34,900
easy and fast to develop I actually

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:36,550
added my own two actually here I'll show

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,150
you what the actual skin looks like so

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:46,930
this is their travel blog that I just

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:50,160
connected to and then so that's the

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:56,620
showing you how easy it is to install

00:13:50,160 --> 00:14:02,470
yourself it's pretty easy and then let's

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:04,360
go back to slides okay i'll be talking

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,250
about our balance extensions which we

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,380
call modules here as you saw in the

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,620
directory that's what we named it talk

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,940
about the modules we have available and

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,650
where it's actually used different

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,680
projects that use it and give you a

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:22,000
demonstration of how to install your own

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:24,760
modules so this is a code i found on the

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,520
website actually so that's the motto we

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,380
follow also it's you know if we had

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,240
components that were tightly integrated

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,100
it was going to be so hard to assemble

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,570
where if we changed one thing it was

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,060
just going to be a ripple of changes

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,560
throughout the code so we tried to go as

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,180
far away as possible so have it

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,400
self-contained and very loosely

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,500
connected we just wanted something like

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,040
to easily just drop in and use just like

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:52,330
the skin for example that I showed and

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:56,710
we have the Cavs browser which connects

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:59,740
to the fam the ODT file manager it it

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,150
gives you a list of all the product

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,620
types we have and you could drill in

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,990
further look at all the products that

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,730
each product type has and drilling even

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,940
further and look at the metadata and be

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,240
able to download your own products the

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,070
monitor module is not at Apache yet but

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,360
it's something we've worked on for some

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:22,240
of the NASA projects we have such as MPP

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,610
sounder Pete hmm so I'm going to give

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,870
you like an example of that also to show

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,230
you like how balanced could be used

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,690
also we have a profile manager but it's

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,150
the one that connects to the ldap and

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,960
lets people to log in for sensitive

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:41,779
information we have news feeds that it's

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,600
really easy to add you know what's going

00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:48,470
on date and just sort it by that and

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,170
give updates to people and RSS would be

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:55,040
uses RSS we have puny content manager

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:57,050
very easy to use just login click and

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,730
change and it's actually connected to a

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,250
markdown back-end I don't know if any of

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,830
you know that what that is but it's very

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,900
easy to use the content manager actually

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,660
has a description of how to use it so

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,600
it's very useful and then we have a

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:16,070
wizard which we've used on one of our

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,529
projects mainly even though we're like

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,260
still working on the implementation of

00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:24,020
that what it does it takes content that

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,210
you've stored in to one page and kind of

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,440
moves it further along the pages that

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,600
you would go through and stores that in

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,310
the end and you could you know do

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,430
whatever you like with it it just takes

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,040
all the components you've might have

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,880
selected and previous pages and collects

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,920
it into one whole thing here are some of

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,050
the projects we have that we've used for

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,790
so it works for a diverse set of science

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:55,130
data systems such as planetary science

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,420
art science radio astronomy some of

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,060
these projects might actually sound

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:07,480
familiar because people talked about it

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:12,160
such as co2 ska ed RN I'll move on to

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,160
the demonstration of our modules

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,910
the modules are really easy to install

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,520
also it's you could find them at Apache

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:36,140
ODT directory it's under the balance

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,080
folder and you could find modules in

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,190
there I've already checked them out

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,950
didn't want to depend too much on the

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,290
internet here I've actually used the

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,540
monitor module which is in the GPL

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,300
repository now but we're hopefully one

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,960
day we'll move that over once it's you

00:17:50,300 --> 00:18:09,470
know passed through Chris madman give

00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:10,820
the okay yeah so sounds good so I've

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,470
checked it out and here's the

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,950
configuration file I already have my

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,620
tomcat server up for connecting to the

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:22,120
file manager in the back end and over

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:28,810
you so I I have it at localhost 990 I

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:31,070
mean night 9900 this is the x

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:35,060
authorization and authentication bit

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,860
that once you have secure data but you

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,120
won't don't want everyone to use that's

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,910
when you would connect to the profile

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,400
manager and make a little a few changes

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:48,260
here and give users the correct the

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,750
correct access to what they need to get

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:57,050
to over here you have you have the

00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:01,340
options to set which metadata fields

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:04,460
will appear in certain sections of of

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:08,030
your cast browser which will be right

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,560
here so I added a link to it right here

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:15,980
and so this is what you would see all

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,440
the product types the description and ID

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,440
and that was set right here

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,259
so it's easy to change so if i wanted to

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:33,409
commit to taking the description out it

00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:39,909
should take it out and just show you the

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:39,909
name and ID and the monitor module

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,620
bricks the same way so the tomcat

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:54,860
servers that i have up points to a pcs

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:57,830
health that Chris madman and some of the

00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,629
other guys at JPL put together before I

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,419
think I started working there right yeah

00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:05,899
and then we have one that actually

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:12,440
connects to the when Jen workflow that's

00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:17,169
why we still haven't moved that there so

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,169
here's an example of what it looks like

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,320
here it is so it tells you that the file

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,220
manager is running at localhost nine

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:34,090
nine hundred 9900 and then your workflow

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,889
manager is running and then crawlers I

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,379
didn't set up any crawlers not that one

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:40,029
would be running right now and then it

00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:43,119
tells you all the last 20 files that

00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:45,149
would be ingested that was ingested in

00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,179
your file manager with the receive time

00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:51,580
so the workflow monitor here gives you

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:54,730
an outline of all the different states

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:59,759
that your workflows would be in and then

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,759
if you click on this oh what happened oh

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:13,499
did my workflow stop running a slash mmm

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,130
oh well it pretty much looks like the

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:24,770
what the crats browser did and it tells

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,809
you so if you have sub processes before

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,730
your processes you could actually drill

00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:33,320
down into it and view those I'm sorry

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,120
they didn't come up but yeah I don't

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,280
have any other examples I think some of

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,809
the NASA projects that requires kind of

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,200
secure so i don't know if i should show

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,730
them right now but it's really simple to

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,620
use and that's kind of what i wanted to

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,390
come out here and tell you guys it's as

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,640
you can see it's easy to install your

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,030
own skin and just seamlessly integrates

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,530
with a website you want to do and you

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:59,230
could add your own modules commit that

00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:02,860
back to apache ODT maybe one day so i

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,860
have time for questions

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,840
last question are very very PHP ignorant

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,790
so humanism how does this relate to

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,970
other HP frameworks does it build on it

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,960
or is something no framework for web

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,960
