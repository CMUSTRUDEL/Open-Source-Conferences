so in spite of the slide you see in

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,140
front of you well that's kind of a blind

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,120
this is intended as an interactive

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,250
discussion where we are going to try to

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,840
shake you down for questions about

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,969
whether you can trust software built by

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,740
volunteers and then we or you will

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,600
supply answers if you're really

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,600
completely fresh out of questions we

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,050
have a few in mind to use to see the

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,310
clouds but I it seems a little we're

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,480
hoping not to go there especially

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,949
because I see a couple of potential

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,320
shills in the audience who might be able

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:36,300
to help so with no further ado would

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,489
anybody put you who would like to pose a

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,590
question or a problem where I worry

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,219
about using software built by volunteers

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:49,079
particularly at Apache please use the

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:51,870
mic what happened Oh what happens when

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:57,350
it breaks in the world would I go get

00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:05,100
help from you can have the first one

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:06,930
when the software breaks so it depends

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,520
on the project right so we have multiple

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,299
projects at the page I have no idea how

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:17,250
many but / 110 PS right now so it

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,909
depends on the community but the I

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,920
assume you're asking about support right

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:30,360
so if you are a company consuming these

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,549
Perpetua projects not products and you

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,710
use them for your own needs or in

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,270
production and you find that defect at

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,950
some point you the good part is that

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,740
unlike commercial software you got to

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,439
that point probably without paying a lot

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,500
of money just paying time and attention

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,570
right and at some point you may decide

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,390
to go for some commercial support or

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,479
what we prefer get involved in the

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,130
community if you know why the software

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,659
is defective and you can provide the

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,770
patch thank you and that's bad for you

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,909
to become involving the community

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,500
interact with people like

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:15,410
many here and get it fixed and then

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:20,060
there's gonna be released at some point

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,770
you know coming up and maybe you gotta

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,480
gotta get involved in that as well and

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,080
you're going to use the next version

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,450
which is patched if you are a company

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,550
that requires support and therefore

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,950
there's another advantage that you can

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,940
have many commercial companies providing

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:40,700
support for you so you have some options

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:43,820
so I'll add a little sauce I mean the

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,209
first thing to know is that while the

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,519
foundation is a collection of relatively

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,739
independently run projects it does it

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,090
does ask those projects to meet some

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,850
minimum standards and one of those

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,310
standards is responsiveness to users so

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,470
if you're using apache software and you

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,150
need help you can ask a question on the

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,610
user list and you have a high likelihood

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,620
of that you'll get some kind of an

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,690
answer if you ask a good if you ask a

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,100
plausible question or if you post a bug

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,660
you'll get some kind of an answer as

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,239
Hadrian says on the other hand you don't

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,620
necessarily have a guarantee so if a

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,329
project really reaches the point at

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,070
Apache where no one's answering the

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,540
phone at all the project gets wound up

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,340
and put in the Attic so that people know

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,440
that they can't expect that kind of

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,940
support from it but by and large Apache

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,280
projects are healthy communities and

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,900
people who pose questions discover that

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,209
in those communities they find lots of

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,070
resources often mostly their fellow

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,840
users as much as the developers or

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,450
contributors to help them with problems

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,170
they have other questions no I want that

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:46,630
something all right

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,980
there's more now the in there are the

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,530
individual projects but then there is

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,680
the SF is a foundation right and one of

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,300
the things it provides besides the legal

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,239
ample and everything is infrastructure

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,980
for these projects and part of it is the

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,170
continuous integration system we have so

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,640
all project or most of the projects I

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,500
mean all are welcome because that's

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,350
available to everybody do continuous

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,780
integration overnight the projects are

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:15,430
built to ensure a level of quality so

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,380
the situations you you mentioned it's

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,120
kind of hypothetical to me because that

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:27,850
doesn't happen much at the Pesci you

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:29,620
know who's next so actually just to

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,419
clarify are we talking about software

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,250
built by volunteers or software built by

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:38,590
volunteers at Apache and there's a

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:41,530
distinction there well you know hadrian

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,540
I had a lengthy philosophical discussion

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,550
yesterday it wasn't to answer that

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,169
question but it actually turned out to

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,729
include an answer to that question so

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,000
the discussion kind of went like this

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:54,039
people say oh gosh it's built by

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,720
volunteers can I possibly bet my company

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,280
on it well and the thought we had was

00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,560
think of all the other things that over

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,650
history and in the modern world people

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,740
depend on that are provided by

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,330
volunteers giant swaths of modern

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,430
infrastructure that are very important

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,680
in the world the Red Cross for example

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,030
just to pull one out of a hat not that

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,390
the average software project is a

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,729
disaster every day sure it has a certain

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,710
number of professionals but though you

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,180
know a very large part of what it does

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,820
as a result of volunteer effort so

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,150
volunteers software can be seen in the

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,000
larger sort of picture of human

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,620
volunteerism and lots of times in the

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,130
world we go out there and we very

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,320
cheerfully bet our happiness well-being

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,060
and livelihood to some extent or another

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,190
on something coming from a volunteer

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,840
doing that with software is just an

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,120
example of that and so that's my answer

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
to the question of you know well how do

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,330
you answer this question in the really

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,860
broad sense now of course aside from

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,570
that giant piece of philosophical

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,639
bloviating I can't tell you much about

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,810
using software

00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,669
by volunteers that are not in Apache

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,539
because the whole idea of this talk is

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,409
to be able to talk about how the

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:06,240
particular way we do things at Apache

00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:07,620
engenders deserve to trust so this go

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
back a little bit to that the talk

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,879
yesterday about the Security Response

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
Team as far as end of life in suffern

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,770
things like that so giving the example

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,539
from my perspective as user will use

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,340
SDKs that come from other companies some

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,189
of that stuff uses very old software in

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:27,449
example beam axis 14 think was released

00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:28,979
back in 2006 okay not really supported

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,300
by the community I understand that it's

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,430
so fricking oh I don't know why people

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,979
are still using it but they are for

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,520
whatever reason okay last year

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,500
vulnerability gets input actually I

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,759
should say one thing axis one force is

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,159
still available from download from the

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,379
regular download side vulnerability gets

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,339
announced against axis 14 and some

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,319
variety of other things

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,029
man-in-the-middle kind of attack NOFX

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,550
ever comes and this really isn't so much

00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,830
y'all improvement or even volunteer

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,949
software it's just how it gets used by a

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,180
broader community and how

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,409
vulnerabilities and end of life and all

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,860
that kind of mix together where

00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:06,180
supportability becomes an issue so I'm

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,800
going to expand this question a little

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,539
bit before giving my part of the answer

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,979
and we'll see what what hey drain wants

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:15,599
to correct so so security is one of the

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,020
most important and one of the most

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,819
difficult ways in which the sochi

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,710
projects and i suppose the volunteer

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,060
software universe in general copes with

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,779
its users because it has this little

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,159
paradox you'd like to keep the existence

00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,050
of a security vulnerability or at least

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:32,789
some people like to keep the existence

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,830
of a software vulnerability a secret

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,389
until there's a fix for it but we

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,860
operate is an open development

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,330
environment where everybody can see

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
what's going on everybody's eye balls

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,870
aren't and that's in part where some of

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,270
the security comes from so what happens

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,399
when there's a security problem well to

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,319
start from the normal case in a normal

00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,389
up and running project the foundation

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,449
has an infrastructure for discreetly

00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:56,639
reporting security problems encouraging

00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,060
projects to attend to them promptly and

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,339
turn those around as releases as rapidly

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,539
as possible for people to use now what

00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,879
we were talking about yesterday which

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,470
led to the question is well what happens

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,180
when there's a piece of software that's

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,550
been built by the foundation which no

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,710
longer has a community prepared to stand

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,420
up and deal with the situation

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,130
particularly a security situation now I

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,170
was learning something yesterday when

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,300
the answer to that question was well

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,650
that is a pretty good indication that

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,660
that piece of software ought to be

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,850
retired that the foundation it shouldn't

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,250
be sitting there for trivial download it

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,930
should be it should go through the

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,610
process that the foundation goes through

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,930
to say this is retired software it's

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,039
available to if you want to go bring

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,080
down the source and play with it but

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,849
don't expect to community behind him so

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,180
leaving aside the question of whether

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,950
axis 14 is sitting out there as if it

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,190
wasn't retired even though it might

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,390
perhaps ought to be that still leaves a

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,680
real practical problem in the world

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,300
which is the question that was asked

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,630
which is what happens when some third

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,970
party has incorporated this antique and

00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,810
it's out there well you know you're not

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,490
that I guess the honest thing to say is

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,110
it's one of these few moments when I

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,160
feel like Richard Stallman has a point

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,710
okay so Richard would say that if the

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,540
whole ecosystem was entirely open source

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,430
all the time then that proprietary

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,860
product which incorporated access for

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,570
wouldn't exist you'd be using an

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,850
entirely open source universe and if

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,010
some piece of it had become you know had

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,230
a problem you would at least have a

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,270
flying chance of replacing it with

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,770
something better of course I wouldn't

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,450
personally want to have to address a

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,190
security problem all by myself by

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,740
replacing access for with a more modern

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,780
technology in a large code base so the

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,250
bottom line here is the answer to every

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,710
possible question here is not Oh

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,890
everything is unicorns and ponies all

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,000
right you know this is a hard one if

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,290
software gets old sometimes the

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,089
community volunteers wanders away

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,100
sometimes there's no one to maintain it

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,870
and if somebody has irresponsibly

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,000
incorporated it isn't keeping up with

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,280
the technology you can have a problem

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,200
it's true you will need to put it in it

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,010
if you have anything if you don't like

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,010
something so

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,520
I agree with everything obviously but

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,250
there is the other side of the coin to

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,690
me right so we are volunteers which to

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,540
me kind of means with quite pragmatic

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,600
and many of us don't spend the time here

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,970
there wasn't a need right so it's very

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,980
likely that these projects will by

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,030
volunteers especially the ones at Apache

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,920
are widely used are in production so

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,480
there are a lot of people like you have

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,490
the same problem and these kind of

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,090
problems are going to be addressed

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,370
quickly right it's you know placing some

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:40,620
bets here now if you are in a situation

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:43,420
like X is 14 okay that's fine but then

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,420
are there many in that situation or not

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,400
if the answer is not then probably there

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,200
is a reason why many people migrated

00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,180
from that piece of software it was

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,770
successful some time ago and now it's

00:10:52,180 --> 00:11:00,250
not any longer however what's the

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:03,550
alternative if you use commercial

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,280
software there are odds that that

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:10,270
software diffuse all commercial software

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,580
equally old it's very unlikely that

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,850
you're going to be able to do anything

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,850
about that and because that's not

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,880
volunteer run but profit Ron I would say

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,590
that you it's a fair bet that nothing is

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,840
going to be done about that so your odds

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,210
are slightly better so even if life is

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:35,650
not perfect I think it's slightly better

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:37,540
than the alternative anybody else maybe

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,360
we have to start working on our using

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,140
our our our fill technology here so a

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,190
show of hands how many of you are here

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,540
thinking from a primarily i'm a

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,880
developer thinking of incorporating

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,740
software perspective as opposed to a

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,240
more sort of business like perspective

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,339
okay i'm not going to run out of

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,930
categories you're pretty soon so how

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,040
many of you are here more thinking from

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,500
a sort of management business

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,480
perspective of okay what's going to

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,210
happen to my company if we pull open

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,050
source software into what we're doing

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,190
all right we have a couple you know

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,839
they're an awful lot of hands that

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,220
didn't go up by either way would any of

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,800
you like to volunteers you're sort of a

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,450
general area of concern

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:21,029
that would give us something to work

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:24,000
from defending open source to the

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,160
corporate corporate types that may not

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,630
understand it as well that's the that's

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,540
the primary reason I'm here is actually

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,100
to acquire a rhetorical skill that

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,579
that's selling the people that might

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,589
need to be persuaded so there are a

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:41,070
couple of topic areas that come up in

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:43,560
the oh gosh can we can the company

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,480
possibly tolerate all the risks of using

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,190
open source now I have a funny feeling

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,930
that this got done in three other talks

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,899
here at this show already but what the

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,610
heck so the ones legal and I've been

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,810
warned not to get bogged down in this

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,570
because you can get bogged down

00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,160
indefinitely now in the keynote just now

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,630
somebody said you know I went to the

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,790
lawyers and lawyers said on the

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,740
particular subject of the GPL be very

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,079
very afraid well I'll tell you all a

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,180
secret if you ask any lawyer any

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,029
question their answer is going to be be

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,649
very very afraid because that's how they

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:17,130
get to build the next five hours from

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,690
you is by is by first elaborating in

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,160
glorious detail what you should be very

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,050
very afraid of and then trying to help

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,880
you find a solution to it so if you're

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,680
looking at the legalities of using

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,390
software from the apache software

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,760
foundation there are few things to know

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:35,660
first of all the license has been used

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,459
extensively and beaten on by an

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,440
unimaginably large volume of corporate

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,410
lawyers who have tasted it and found it

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,880
good unlike what you might find if you

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,589
are in tell them some of you may

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:55,800
recognize the poem i'm quoting i don't

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:56,790
know and and so your legal risks you

00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,079
know there's there's a good deal of

00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,850
reason to believe that whatever a

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,589
particular lawyer you're talking to you

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,270
today might say to you your legal risks

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:04,760
in terms of the straight out what

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,380
happens if we use this license are

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,050
honestly really very low now you might

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,690
also worry about things like well what

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,850
if some crumb of proprietary information

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,920
from some other place has crept into the

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,560
foundation source control system somehow

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,540
and now we have some liability well you

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,390
know so that's a bad news good news

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,220
situation the bad news is you might get

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,990
a call from well you might in a remote

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,340
unimaginable circumstance get a call get

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,210
a nasty letter from someone telling you

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,610
to stop using it as far as I know it's

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,200
never happened okay now tune understand

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,050
understand understand why off to

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,250
understand how Apache projects work

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,350
there's a source control system a

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,550
limited group of people have permission

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,580
to put things in that source control

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,590
system all those people have signed

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,090
agreements that that say that anything

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,860
they put in the agreement to the best of

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,280
their knowledge is there is to give and

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,110
there and they are granting the apache

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,680
license to it which the foundation in

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,300
turn in grants to you one of the biggest

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,970
responsibilities that we try to teach

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,370
Apache PMC's about is that their job is

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,170
to make sure that the things that go

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,830
into the source control repository are

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,960
in fact I p which is clearly what it

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,580
says that it is you know the the actual

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,920
work of the people who are volunteering

00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,780
it or is coming or comes in through a

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
more bureaucratic process the foundation

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,830
has called the software grant agreement

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,260
process whereby the saw the foundation

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,570
can adopt larger bodies of code while

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,580
keeping IP provenance clear so you can

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,380
say to your lawyers here's the apache

00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,660
software foundation they have this hall

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,460
IP providence structure it's all out

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,290
there where we can all see it we can see

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,730
all the week an see the records of where

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,670
the code came from we can see where it

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,740
was committed it's clean so you know

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,540
that's my jug act on the legal aspect of

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,250
the risks of open source now another

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,020
common sort of corporate concern about

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,570
open source already came up as a

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,210
question is it going to break who's

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,340
going to take care of us now you know

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:02,520
the first answer you have to someone who

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,420
says that is and when was the last time

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,620
you got a bug fixed by Microsoft I'm

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,210
unless of course you're a corporate

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,260
behemoths now they mean the interesting

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,670
thing about this and part of the

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,920
abstract Mohammed wrote who was

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,020
originally planning to be here was that

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,310
this talk was sort of designed to kind

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,200
of address companies that are not

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,030
gigantic companies that have giant

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,640
platoons lawyers to cope with everything

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,730
and from small company standpoint you're

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,320
really much better off interacting with

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,600
Apache than you are interacting with

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,270
commercial software vendor X because you

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,610
because you've got an important resource

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,810
very likely smart people who can engage

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,449
with the community at this point I think

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,859
I should stop talking give Hadrian

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,509
chance and let him talk a little bit

00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:43,879
again about sort of community engagement

00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:48,169
is a way of getting what you need out of

00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,299
projects yeah that's a tough one lots of

00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:57,169
questions related more to social aspects

00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:58,639
legal aspects like before us i'll give

00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:02,119
you some type of thing looks like you

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,339
need a man there there is a curveball

00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:07,189
somebody threw at me a few days ago and

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:10,399
I don't know that the answer apparently

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:12,319
there was a situation at some company

00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,089
it's not a big companies not a software

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,370
company it's a software company that

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,389
uses software where they had to choose

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:22,630
between open source or big corporate

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:26,569
technology and the push for the

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:31,940
commercial software was that it's more

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:35,000
expensive it wasn't really as clear as

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:42,500
dead and apparently the reason is that

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:48,049
managers want big budgets big teams in

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,940
order to advance in their careers okay I

00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:53,600
didn't think about it before I have no

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,600
idea why but if they do something lean

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,889
and mean they are fast to market and you

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,389
know they have a group of smart people

00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:07,100
they that's not what managers want

00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:09,019
that's what startups one right and I'm

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,549
not sure how you saw this kind of these

00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:13,789
kinds of issues that's why I asked what

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,260
exactly is what your address what is

00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:18,139
Bora fulfill a philosophical question

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,029
well honestly I what I was trying to do

00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:23,299
originally was answered Benson's

00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:26,090
question about why are you here and but

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:31,420
the the question that actually comes up

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:33,730
more for me is actually selling

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,220
management on sponsoring open-source

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:40,090
development which is not quite the same

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,370
question that this this top this meeting

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,470
is supposed to address but I don't know

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,170
that it's it even though I couldn't

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,280
quite lure Hadrian to telling me telling

00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,650
you all what he told me yesterday about

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,140
this I'm kind of quoting him a bit in

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,570
terms of the relevance of this talk to

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,580
that question so to understand what I'm

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,160
on about you have to look at the reality

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,960
of what does it take to get support from

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,640
an Apache project which was really our

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,010
first question okay so let's be honest

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,530
if you show up on the user list and blop

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,210
out an email message demanding all kinds

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,130
of assistance with some cockamamie use

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,110
case that you're trying to come up with

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,820
for some piece of Apache Software the

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,230
bit you know the realities of the

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,310
situation are you're likely to get a

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:23,440
fairly chilly response okay what you get

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,750
out of an Apache project like many

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,340
community things in the world is debris

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,240
is very proportional to what you put

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,800
into it so if you want I know if you

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,870
walk up to an opiate when you walk up to

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,970
an open source both actually let me back

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,500
up a second if you walk up to httpd and

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,080
you're just running a website chances

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,330
are it works great okay it's going to do

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,560
its bit it's a very mature piece of

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,830
software and if you have a problem

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,960
you're probably just having a little

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,920
confusing the documentation or figuring

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,930
out how to apply it to your particular

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,550
solution and you'll ask a question and

00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,320
someone might even answer it for you but

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,700
if you're using any of these things that

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,620
we're cheerfully building out on the

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,570
bleeding edge where they're built by

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,400
scratching one each at a time and are

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,260
not a very mature solution to a very

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,700
well-defined problem there's a pretty

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,470
good chance that if your company sets

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,000
out to use a piece of apache software it

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,100
will take you about a month and a half

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,800
before you run into something which does

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,860
not do what you want and it won't

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,020
necessarily be a defect you know a gross

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,940
bug where you can say look that

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,340
documentation says this and it does that

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,050
it will just be a use case that the

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,810
people who've worked on it so far have

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,640
not found itchy enough to scratch and

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,350
you know how you're going to get that to

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,660
do you and the good news is you can get

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,980
it to do exactly what you want the bad

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,600
news is you can get it to do exactly

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,400
what you want by having one of your

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,320
people show up join the community and

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,540
contribute exactly what you want and you

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,549
know you can't do that with proprietary

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,980
software so

00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,619
so instead of saying gosh it might not

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,929
do what we want the question is given

00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:55,179
the inevitability that no software ever

00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,980
does what you want where is the better

00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:03,009
cost profile to get it to do what you

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:06,999
want I it is that when you when you have

00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:08,889
someone who's a committer on the PMC and

00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,960
software breaks you're going to have a

00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:13,269
lot of people who are already part of

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,029
the community you're working with your

00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:18,429
disposal so if there's a question of if

00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:19,720
there's a bug yeah you can really count

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,999
on apache software if you've got

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,789
somebody in your company is empowered

00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:28,960
that as a PMC member to the committer to

00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:31,659
fix it right there and then then there's

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,399
also the question of the long lively but

00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:37,299
it's the how long is the project going

00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:40,450
to last I guess the altar I might ask

00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:44,409
that I'd say but compare that also to

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,659
commercial options well so I'm going to

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:48,399
I'm going to add one little bit of sauce

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,169
to this rather of conversation I think

00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,700
then Hadrian wants to turn which is I'm

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,409
going to speak from personal experience

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,109
i'm going to say what am I in particular

00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:58,779
doing here okay my company does not is

00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:00,700
not an open-source software company

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:03,909
basis technology who for which I happen

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,619
to be the CTO we use a bunch of open

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:07,809
source and some of us contribute in the

00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,129
community here but we're not an open

00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,289
source business model what am I doing

00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:12,759
here spending three days okay well the

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,489
reason is that it became clear to me

00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:18,340
very early on that the best that that

00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:21,429
for every hour or so I put into an

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,499
Apache project that was relevant to our

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:25,359
business that was providing a piece of

00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:27,009
infrastructure technology were using if

00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,399
I played my cards right I could get

00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:32,320
about six back in terms of useful value

00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,909
coming back my way and I think you know

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,639
that of course is a metric pulled

00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:38,529
straight out of my ear but um that's the

00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,480
general principle here is that the best

00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,100
sales pitch I know of to make to the

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
management about why should you put

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,850
people too are contributing is that it's

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,399
a leveraging factor joining the

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,049
community has a multiplier effect you by

00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,789
and large if you're on if you make an

00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,580
honest contribution in the community

00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:56,550
you'll get more back than you put in

00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:02,650
yesterday use that

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:03,880
amplify the value getting back oh so

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:08,500
that then there's this much every

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,480
question you want to talk to that yeah I

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,970
mean for as long as there is a need as I

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,740
said we're quite pragmatic people if

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,440
there is no need we're gonna focus our

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,150
attention towards something else and one

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,370
of the things that communities do they

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,740
try to attract new developers who

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,270
started to use the technology problem

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,830
because there is it in production they

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,840
have some need that they conclude the

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,120
project they maintain it and you know

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:37,870
people move on but that's how life is

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,690
you were starting to you were starting

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:43,740
to share your experiences father maybe I

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,170
join in and maybe someone else does too

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,630
one of the main reasons that one of the

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:53,710
companies that I currently consult for

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,630
use open source is quite contrary to

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,460
what you were talking before because

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:02,530
it's cheap because it doesn't cost

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:06,940
anything simply because we can use it

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:09,130
without paying huge licensing fees but

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,960
the other thing and that is that is

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:16,320
personally my main reason why i use open

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:23,620
source where i've been using it it's

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:25,840
because i can look at the code and and

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,930
fix it or learn from it if necessary

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,430
maybe even fix it but yeah look at if

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:36,220
something is broken i inevitably have to

00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:38,320
look at the code to be able to fix it i

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,360
mean that's that's the only technique

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,570
that I've learned so far maybe someone

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,220
has something smarter which brings a

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,980
point advanced bench and mentioned

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,420
before the documentation right so people

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,710
look at the documentation they look at

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,990
the code hey this thing is doing

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,240
something different so this is a tough

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,160
problem to solve because people want the

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,020
people here most of them like to write

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:05,040
software north right documentation and

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,040
we're looking for volunteers

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:18,840
here comes the ultimate ringer I'll be a

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,630
bit of a shield okay volunteers are a

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,290
fickle Bunch you know as Benson said

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:28,559
they they tend to scratch their own itch

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,630
okay so as long as the technology and

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,860
the code is interesting they'll work on

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,450
it and then they'll walk off and do

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,770
something else whereas with paid people

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,990
whether they like it or not they like

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,250
getting paid a lot so they'll keep them

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,919
working on something for long or longer

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,020
so how do you address people who say

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,040
that I can't depend on software

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:52,530
volunteers because there's no continuity

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:58,559
with any any code or projects which are

00:25:52,530 --> 00:26:01,260
you know built and made by volunteers on

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,970
a slightly different topic I told Benson

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,169
yesterday that last year I went with

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,870
Habitat for Humanity and we build some

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,640
houses and I'm not a lawyer we talked

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:18,000
about I'm not a carpenter either right

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:20,100
and you mentioned scratching an itch

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
right so whatever each I had to start

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,090
building houses for other people but

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,520
anyway anyway we did that we did some

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:28,770
community work and it's kind of similar

00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,309
in the way that I wasn't there full time

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:34,140
for the whole duration of the house

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:37,230
people before us came and put the

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,790
foundation we put the frame was you know

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,049
a very good of nails and stuff like that

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:45,630
and I think it's quite similar you do

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,419
stuff for a reason but if you have a

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,540
large pool of people with the various

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:54,780
set of skills with the various sets of

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:58,080
interest I think that project is much

00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:04,169
more likely to survive be of a higher

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,940
quality then a project that's run by I'm

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:08,490
not cover going into that you know some

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,530
manager being more successful in the

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,870
power struggle in the corporate politics

00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,150
at some point in time well the other

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,730
thing I think we should say is that the

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,740
foundation has some ways of doing

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,110
business which are intended specifically

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,960
to address the problem of short

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,360
attention spans so an Apache project is

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,220
very careful we openness is great for a

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,720
lot of reasons openness means you know

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,550
what's going on openness means you can

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,040
read the code openness means there's a

00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,530
giant email archive of everything that

00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,850
of importance or of a bar you know of

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,120
every of every decision that was ever

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:44,520
made in a project so that as time passes

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,410
and people wander in and out the new

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,480
people have a lot of resources for

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,820
coming to grips with the technology and

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,040
carrying it along now does this work

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,920
perfectly no ok the other thing to keep

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,870
in mind here is that the word volunteer

00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,520
at Apache is a kind of central paradox

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,730
of the organization at least in my

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,440
peculiar mode ok yes we're all here

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,030
acting as volunteer as if some of you

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,680
saw my incubator talk the first day we

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,180
are wearing our Apache volunteer hats

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,620
who paid for that hat ok in many cases

00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:16,050
we're being paid by our employers to

00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,000
wear that hat ok so we act as volunteers

00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,680
we put our corporate affiliations aside

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,990
in terms of acting for the public good

00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,820
and producing the software but somebody

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,430
likes this stuff enough to pay us to do

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,200
it and so that of course improve that

00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,120
put that casts a certain amount of

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,190
actually what that really does is it

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,380
muddies the comparison between volunteer

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,300
and non volunteer software if you buy

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,800
software for a commercial company yep

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,390
those people are being paid to do it as

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,890
salary is nice on the other hand they

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,720
may not be liking their job so much this

00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,950
week there might be a power struggle and

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,390
they may all get assigned to work on the

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,160
next big thing and then you're high and

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,950
dry on your bug fix if you use software

00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,150
from Apache yup all the air molecules in

00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,500
the volunteer room might run to the

00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,260
wrong side this week and leave you high

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,150
and dry but it doesn't really happen

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,210
very often now the other thing I would

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:02,640
give you a piece of advice which is

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,920
while I'm here speaking on behalf sort

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,710
of of Apache and raw and cheerleading

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,780
Apache I would tell people to use the

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,610
same common sense in evaluating the use

00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,560
of apache software that I use in telling

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,550
them to evaluate anything else before

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,080
you bet your company on Apache X then I

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,730
would strongly recommend that you spend

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,100
a couple of weeks watching the mailing

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,690
lists of Apache X and looking back in

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,670
time a little bit and getting a feel for

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,530
what's going on in there you will

00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,880
rapidly in the open community get a

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,710
sense of whether this is a viable

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,720
hopping

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,669
place which looks like it's got legs and

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,820
is going someplace or whether there are

00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:39,860
crickets chirping in the night okay you

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,779
know the reality is some of our projects

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,130
are kind of have those days and you

00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:53,510
might not want about your company on one

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:56,870
of them quick question for this round

00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:08,179
how many here are paid and how many are

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:19,309
really just volunteers okay who's

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:23,000
willing to you well yeah I raised my

00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:26,890
head twice because I'm paid for some

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,890
projects and I volunteer on others

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:51,580
either way sometimes you're paid first

00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:54,390
to be a pop reluctant volunteer yes so

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:57,370
I'm kind of on both sides of the camp

00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:00,010
I'm a reluctant volunteer got paid first

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:02,620
but our company is also open source so

00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,020
you know we have all the business

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,490
dynamics of one of the things that's

00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,399
good for us is that we can sell our

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:12,760
software for less and you know get

00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:15,399
places where we couldn't otherwise and

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,990
in fact this question not exactly warded

00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:19,630
this way came up last night on the flex

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,490
list somebody was like how can I you

00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,789
know that my company on flex now that

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:27,399
it's not part of Adobe anymore and

00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:31,090
actually piped up and said well if it's

00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,409
you know been donated to Apache probably

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,289
a good chance it's going to live longer

00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:37,450
than if it had stated Adobe because as

00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:40,510
long as there's a need it's going to be

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,890
there and so if you're part of the need

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,039
then you know it's kind of a

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:47,409
self-perpetuating thank you know if you

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,049
need it you're going to and you have

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:53,919
actually a chance of continuing to make

00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:57,700
it happen so anyway I decides with it

00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,730
it's a very relevant question and and

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,529
i'm also a PMC member on pivot so i'm on

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,120
the other side of the camp two people

00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:08,430
have asked me the same question you know

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:12,309
can I that my company on pivot

00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:18,220
you know I'm here formation I'm using it

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:22,150
i'm driving so there is another aspect

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:25,870
so we talked about being paid and being

00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:29,230
volunteer and benson mentioned that the

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:32,380
line is blurred sometimes its body part

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,540
of the thing i do and i think many do is

00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:36,280
also try to influence the thought in our

00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:41,290
own companies about the future of

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:45,000
technology about what the trends are so

00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:47,530
i think the volunteering part also

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,670
benefits the company who's paying for

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,809
the head so i'm not really sure exactly

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:55,360
even if there is a pattern for this

00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:58,300
dynamic so to me it's quite interesting

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,460
the hole opens social aspect of open

00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,470
source and what it leads to it really

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,900
changed my life I'm really not sure how

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,210
to explain it more but it's no I don't

00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,270
think there is a one answer to all these

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,270
questions

00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:22,850
well we have a little time left anything

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,230
else you remember from our preparation

00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,669
do you think we haven't covered I think

00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,340
we've pretty much talked about most of

00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:34,730
these subjects that we anticipated here

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:39,830
I guess there's one more thing that I

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:43,880
thought about this this morning it's not

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:46,580
only the cost of that lower cost of

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,350
going with open source and it's a bit of

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:53,750
a tricky subject as well like and it's

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:57,020
legal related what makes technology

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,580
valuable is also standards right and I

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,799
was mentioned to mentioning to Benson

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,360
that you know we replace tires to our

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,429
cars we don't really care we buy

00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,600
whatever generic brand we don't really

00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:09,560
care about the brand of the tires

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:14,600
sometimes some people drive cars and

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,440
they don't care about them so and that's

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,940
only possible because of standards and

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,190
it's also the mindset we have here at

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,649
apache and some other volunteer on

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,830
projects to provide standards-based as

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:29,960
much as possible technology and for us

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:33,230
the energies of focus I know it's the

00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,060
focus for many companies but for the big

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,830
ones who are trying to lead the market

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,480
sometimes the interest is quite the

00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,440
opposite to provide some vendor lock-in

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,139
and here we want we like it or not we

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,810
have to collaborate together many people

00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,000
from any organizations or not to provide

00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,669
a standards-based is possibly the

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,210
possible technology which is a i think a

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:58,490
huge value for our users so while we're

00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,800
adding one lasts i had one last thought

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,570
about things you can tell the management

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,940
about why open-source volunteering is a

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:07,040
good thing it gets people it gets the

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,540
children out of the house I'm actually

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,240
that's not quite the metaphor I meant

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,760
but it gets it gets your developers from

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,250
fresh air um development organizations

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,350
have a tendency to become somewhat

00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,600
insular they have a particular way of

00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,510
doing things they have particular tools

00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,550
they use and the longer you're there

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,410
especially if you're successful at

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,710
retaining your people the more that kind

00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,240
of

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,970
wraps itself into a kind of

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,980
all-encompassing worldview that isn't

00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,780
always easily penetrated by new thinking

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,260
and yeah you can send people off to

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,580
conventus you know to I don't know

00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,349
meetings like this and hope that

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,780
something leaks in in between the beers

00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,430
but sticking p pushing people out of the

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,470
nest a little bit to operate in an open

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,880
source project they learn some new

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,320
things they learn some new things about

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,150
getting along with people in a

00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,619
collaborative way they can learn some

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,839
new technologies they can learn some new

00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:59,720
methods that all comes back in and

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,550
brings interesting thought and new

00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,260
techniques back into your company that

00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,839
might not get there if you just stayed

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,310
inside of the compound all right I think

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,550
we're close enough to done to declare

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,550
