okay thank you yeah so I was actually I

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,309
was realizing i put NSF in the title and

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,570
then I was wondering actually as I was

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,980
sitting here probably the people in this

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,090
room generally know what MSF is but I

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,490
wasn't actually completely sure of

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,690
everybody else at the conference did so

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,880
maybe I should have spelled out National

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,279
Science Foundation the other thing that

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,930
I wanted to say is that I said oci here

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,390
and that's what's in the book and in the

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,519
title and oci is the office of cyber

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,900
infrastructure but we've recently been

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,189
renamed and and acquired in some sense

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,140
and we're now the division of advanced

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,219
cyber infrastructure within the computer

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,770
science Directorate so so that I'll get

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,690
going I guess because this is the the

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,969
very end of the the conference with the

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,070
exception of some something that's gonna

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,379
happen after the brakes in closing I'd

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,690
like to try to make this informal if we

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,640
can so I'm actually going to stand here

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,590
behind the microphone which is bad but I

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,600
guess that's what the camera once but if

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,739
you guys have questions if there's

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,870
something that I seem to be skipping

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,190
over then just interrupt me and tell me

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,350
and we can stop and talk about something

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,220
else at the time I was I think at one

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,930
point I was thinking this was a

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,240
45-minute talk rather than an hour so

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm not quite sure how far I'll go we'll

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,479
see okay so um great so software as

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,090
infrastructure what what does that mean

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,710
so just to give some examples of some

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,619
science that's going on that NSF has

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,049
been involved in the funding we had this

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,900
discovery announced at cern in july of

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,040
last year of the higgs boson which was

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,000
quite exciting and actually sorry my

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,130
physics friends say that I'm supposed to

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,810
say that this is a a particle not

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,479
inconsistent with the expectations for

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,400
the Higgs boson so so something was

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,290
found in and this is probably what it is

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,360
but nobody is exactly sure I mean it's

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,119
you know it's found using this LHC Large

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,149
Hadron Collider instrument which is a

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,310
about a billion euro instrument that's

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,040
been running for a couple of years in

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,320
production now but in addition to that

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,360
billion euros that built this thing that

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,960
actually does these collisions there's

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,759
also this big set of infrastructure of

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,789
computing hardware of the worldwide LHC

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,670
computing grid which is about 235,000

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,620
cores across 36 countries and includes

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,019
open science grid in the US

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,470
egi in Europe and other things in other

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:21,690
places it's producing lots of data about

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,180
20 petabytes of data in the last couple

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,739
of years there's all sorts of software

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,230
involved grid middleware physics

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,599
analysis applications there's networks

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,099
that bringing all these things together

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,690
there's education and training about

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,370
getting people able to use this and

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,730
write the software and everything like

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,129
that and in my understanding is that

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,940
that's about 80 million euros a year in

00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:46,079
terms of the computing hardware and and

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,849
actually there's kind of a weird story

00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,489
about why the computing is distributed

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,829
thats related to budgets and and not

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,920
wanting to have the full cost announced

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,940
at the beginning but nonetheless

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,230
everything's distributed and everything

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,459
has been working so so this is a single

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,140
instrument that's generating data

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,670
centrally then it has to move it across

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,170
this multi-tiered infrastructure in

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,310
order to do the computing all right so

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,299
there's lots of different pieces of

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,299
infrastructure that are really

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:16,379
supporting these science discoveries

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:18,599
another example I was at LSU we had this

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,819
big hurricane called Katrina that went

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,680
across New Orleans and this is just

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,709
showing that tracks the forecast tracks

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,209
over time and as you can see when we're

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,150
a few days out this is every dot is

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,799
every six hours it takes pretty long

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,000
time before the track started to

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,919
converge to New Orleans and in order to

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,419
do this analysis and to try to figure

00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,190
out really what was happening in advance

00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,959
all right there's there's these big

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,970
multiphysics applications that are going

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,519
on that involve atmosphere or ocean

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,650
coastal models vegetation model soil

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
models that have different sensors

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,329
satellite sensors satellites and other

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,060
data systems as well as local data

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,180
systems as inputs and then there's all

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,349
these kind of human issues as well so so

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,060
if you're trying to figure out what's

00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,530
going to happen as this storm goes

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,480
overhead you can figure out through

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,280
through these models here's kind of the

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,019
waves and here's how the storm surge is

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,910
going to go ashore but then you want to

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,959
actually see okay so where are the roads

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,510
and how are the roads going to be

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,970
affected where are the people when you

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,739
say that you're going to evacuate where

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,940
are the number of people at that point

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,350
where are they going to go where they

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,730
going to

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,070
evacuate are they going to go home and

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,540
pick up their dog right all right so

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,070
there's behavioral models there's a lot

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,040
of different actual models that go into

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,980
all this and so the infrastructure here

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
is really the ability to do urgent and

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,080
scheduled processing so when the

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,730
hurricane pops up the first time it's

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,250
it's usually something that wasn't

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,380
exactly planned scientists knew that

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,080
there is a possibility but you want to

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,510
immediately start doing some forecasting

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
and then over time you kind of get into

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,170
a state where every six hours or so

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,330
there's new wind forecasts coming and

00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,380
you start doing right new processing and

00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,640
you know that you're going to be able to

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,010
do though so you can make reservations

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,450
for time there's workflow is because

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,560
these are ensembles so there's lots of

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,990
things that need to happen in their

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,660
linked so there's basically chains of

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,340
workflows or larger workflows there's

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,370
the applications there's again the

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,750
network's bringing the data together

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,430
decision support systems visualization

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,260
systems data storage interoperability

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,390
right so there's again there's a lot of

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,990
infrastructure here and some of its

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,400
software but a lot of it isn't okay if

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,320
we look at the other end of things what

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,830
we tend to call longtail science as

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,170
opposed to big science there's there's

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,900
right exploding data volumes today and

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,400
new simulation methods meaning that

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,710
there's more and more researchers that

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,470
are really working in in science areas

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,430
with access to data and access to

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,860
computing in this graph is looking at

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,710
award size versus number of awards for

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,600
NSF grants and what you can see is that

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,730
there's some very large awards but there

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,420
is a very very long tail of smaller

00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,650
Awards and all of these people well not

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,360
all of them but a large number of them

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,480
are doing some kind of computational

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,270
work right and in generally they can't

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,860
afford to have expensive expertise and

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,840
unique infrastructure like the like the

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,210
big projects can all right they need to

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,980
be able to use things that already exist

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,650
and to use things that are available for

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,180
multiple resources researchers so the

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,970
challenge here is to either outsourcer

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,870
to automate time-consuming common

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,249
processes and so just as an example one

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,289
of those things that has to have

00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:31,999
is data transfer moving data from one

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,019
place to another where it's generated to

00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,819
where it's processed where it's

00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:37,009
processed or at storage something like

00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,319
that so there are tools like Globus

00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,879
online as an example that are able to do

00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,329
this and this is kind of just a chart

00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,789
showing the duration of runs that are

00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:49,159
happening over some a couple of year

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:51,549
period through through Globus online and

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,659
it's showing basically that we've got

00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:56,329
some things that are one second one

00:06:53,659 --> 00:07:00,349
minute one hour one day one week the

00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:02,029
green dots are over a terabyte the red

00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,739
dots over 10 terabytes of data being

00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,749
transferred so there's substantial

00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,789
amounts of data being moved by services

00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:10,309
like this there's also science gateways

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:11,989
as we heard about yesterday things like

00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:14,029
nanohub and cypress that we'll talk

00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:16,099
about in a minute and other ways of

00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:19,759
providing access to common scientific

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:21,769
software so so Cypress just as an

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,110
example of this Cypress is a science

00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:25,969
gateway for phylogenetics studying the

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,149
diversification of life and the

00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:30,619
relationships of living things over time

00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:32,599
it's it's a highly used tool with

00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:34,699
citations and this is actually probably

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,469
six months ago so this is these numbers

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,809
are probably a bit old at that point

00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:41,779
about 400 publications including kind of

00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:43,759
pretty large journals five thousand

00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:45,519
users at that point in three years i

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,199
think it's closer to ten thousand now

00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,629
used routinely in 68 undergraduate

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,579
classes at that time forty five percent

00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,639
of the usage being us fifty five percent

00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,110
being international and and so there's

00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,879
an infrastructure here that's a flexible

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,339
web application or a science gateway

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,979
that can be built on common tools that

00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,179
can be used for other science gateways

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:08,029
there's software and lessons from the

00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:10,669
exceed gateways team identity management

00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,110
HPC job control there's actually the

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,709
science software that does the science

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,269
itself and so in that case it's parallel

00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,009
versions of codes that were commonly

00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:22,009
used but may not have been parallel

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,959
available as parallel codes before and

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,459
then a lot of stuff about data so areas

00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,829
for users to store the data that they're

00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,399
working with tools to transfer and view

00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:32,719
the data okay so with those as examples

00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,189
what I've tried to say is that there's

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,949
there's a lot of infrastructure that's

00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:38,509
needed for a lot of science and the

00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,829
challenges in infrastructure actually

00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,479
kind of fall in a bunch of different

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:43,000
areas

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,880
so in terms of science what we see today

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,250
is as larger teams more disciplines

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,380
being represented in in teams as well as

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,899
across teams and more countries being

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,120
involved in such projects in terms of

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,800
data we have increases in the size and

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
the complexity and the rate or all the

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,360
v's if you want to say it that way we

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,550
have the need for interoperability in

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,079
terms of data which can be systems that

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,389
have two inner operator can be policies

00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,800
that have to interoperate in terms of

00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,329
the system's themselves the computing

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,459
systems we're having increasing numbers

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,860
of cores increasing diversity of

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:18,010
architectures more levels of memory

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,519
hierarchy balances are changing all

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,230
right so Layton sees are changing very

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,209
slowly bandwidths are changing more

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,060
quickly so the balance between them is

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:30,160
changing over time the the limit on

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,630
computing systems used to be how much

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,670
funds you had available to build what

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,440
you wanted soon it's going to be how

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,230
much power you can afford in order to

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,730
run what you can build system

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,980
architectures and business models are

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,449
changing so so the role of clouds and

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,560
virtualization coming into this I think

00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:49,269
is a question it's well the extent to

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,860
which clouds are going to be the answer

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,440
may be as the question a certainly will

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,389
have some role network capability and

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,920
capacity are growing but the increase in

00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:59,740
things being networked means that we

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,800
need to have increased security in terms

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,760
of software as I was saying before

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,920
algorithms are including more and more

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,569
physics there's more and more frameworks

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,490
that are being built to actually do

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,230
these things we're having new

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,790
programming models and abstractions well

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,319
either we have or we need new

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,110
programming models and obstructions for

00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:18,870
science and data and hardware issues of

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,579
verification and validation

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,170
reproducibility and fault tolerance

00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,040
again are things that people

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,079
traditionally haven't necessarily

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,790
thought about in production software but

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,760
are beginning to realize are necessary

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,560
and then finally in terms of people we

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,230
don't do as good a job as we need to in

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,730
terms of education and training we don't

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,620
provide career paths for people in

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,589
software particularly at universities

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,360
that we probably should and and there's

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:44,649
large issues about credited attribution

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,030
I'm going to talk about some of these as

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:51,280
we go through so also as asmar

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,500
when presented yesterday and this is the

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,790
stuff of this yeah thank you it was

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,250
interesting as actually checking as you

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,140
were doing it and I noticed that the the

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,160
borders on the words are exactly the

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,570
same when I was wondering how you did

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,190
that okay very good so so Craig stored

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,170
in Indiana has this definition of cyber

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,910
infrastructure that i really like saying

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,800
that cyber infrastructure is computing

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,740
systems data storage systems advanced

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,670
instruments and data repositories

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,530
visualization environments and people

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,270
all linked together by software and

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,650
high-performance networks to improve

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,300
research productivity and enable

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,950
breakthroughs not otherwise possible and

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,480
so if you think about this as a

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,010
definition of sovereign freh structure

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,440
then the elements of the infrastructure

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,270
can be brought out and the elements then

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,070
are there parts of an infrastructure

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,190
they're developed by individuals and

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,990
groups often internationally they're

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,600
developed for a purpose and they're used

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,820
by a community and so when we have

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,490
proposals that come in to NSF that want

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,470
to want to build some element of

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,050
infrastructure one of the things we look

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,610
at is what are the answers to all these

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,670
questions right how does this thing fit

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,110
with other things who's building it what

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,420
are the partnerships what's the purpose

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,640
who are the users going to be all right

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,560
so so in some sense this definition

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,700
actually leads to all the interesting

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,260
questions that you might want to ask so

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,870
so software is infrastructure that's

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,280
really one of the the arguments that I

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,770
want to make it's it's one of the

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,170
different types of infrastructure if we

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,580
look at at the role of software it fits

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,320
in between the science that gets done

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,390
and the computing infrastructure that's

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,610
underneath it's the thing that really

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,560
glues them together if we look at

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,060
scientific discovery and technological

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,150
innovation you can think of software is

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,500
in between those things the technology

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,570
drives the software that drives science

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,280
or the science requirements get

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,540
transferred into software and then lead

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,950
to advances in technology there's a

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,210
relationship between software and

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,700
education that's interesting and that

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,220
software can be used to to help with

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,870
education but we also need education in

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,970
order to create the people that are

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,850
going to be able to build software or to

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,350
be able to use it so so the argument

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,060
that I want to make is that software is

00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,350
essential for the bulk of science that's

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,940
being done today

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,640
when I looked at some recent issues of

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,230
science about half of the papers talked

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,230
about projects that really software

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,270
intensive the research that's going on

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,070
is becoming increasingly dependent on

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,020
advances in the underlying software and

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,270
their significant software being

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,660
developed across NSF in a variety of

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:22,330
areas so Sony on I think was mentioned

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:26,580
by somebody here oh I is an ocean

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:30,040
project nice is a an earthquake project

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:33,010
ncn is a nanotechnology project I plant

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,440
is looking at plant genetics and implant

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,910
behavior in some sense so there's

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,010
there's things going on and software

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,380
across NSF that all have some common

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,270
needs there's a wide range of different

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,690
types of software from from systems

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:49,200
applications to modeling to gateways

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,430
analysis algorithms middleware libraries

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,080
development and production of and

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,110
maintenance of software are people

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,700
intensive so so in some ways you could

00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,710
say that the cost of software is

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,150
increasing because the cost of people is

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,640
increasing where the cost of hardware is

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,050
going down on software life times are

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,570
long compared to the hardware there was

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,940
a discussion I don't remember in the I

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,700
guess in the business panel yesterday

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,260
about 50 year lifetimes for projects I I

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,730
don't know about 50 year lifetimes for

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,860
software but we certainly have software

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,220
that's that are now that's 20 or 30

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,660
years old and in depending on who you

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,180
talk to some people would call those

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,620
some of those applications legacy

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,160
applications and I kind of prefer

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,330
heritage as a more positive term but

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,920
there's but there's definitely work

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,240
that's been going on for a long time

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,470
with large numbers of people and we

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,580
don't really want to lose the the

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,220
results of that work which are often

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,870
captured in software and then finally

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,150
software i think has an underappreciated

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,160
value we've gotten to the point where

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,080
we're computing hardware that you can

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,180
buy people kind of understand what it's

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,550
worth data people are starting to

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,620
understand has has more value than they

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,910
thought before and right and there's

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,070
lessons about what we need to keep and

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,690
what we don't software i don't think is

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,800
quite there yet but it's it's moving in

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:06,070
the right direction so I'm so at NSF in

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,040
terms of looking at infrastructure there

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,150
is a set of documents and an activity

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,170
that started

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,570
I don't know maybe five years ago or so

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,550
called cyberinfrastructure framework for

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,640
21st century science and engineering or

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,470
sip 21 and this really was really was

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,450
looking at a cross NSF portfolio of

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,390
activities to provide integrated cyber

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,740
resources to enable new research

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,320
opportunities in all science and

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,820
engineering fields by leveraging ongoing

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,000
investments and using common approaches

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,040
and components so what NSF did after

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,460
kind of defining this is that set up six

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,800
task forces across the country with I

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,630
don't know between 30 and 40 people

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,790
maybe 50 people in each task force I'm

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,400
looking at basically what needs to be

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,900
done in these areas of campus bridging

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,250
meaning how to connect campuses together

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,710
with national resources and how to

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,930
connect campuses with each other sabra

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,320
learning and workforce development data

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:05,040
and visualization Grand Challenges HPC

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,100
and software for science and engineering

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,660
and in each of these areas wrote reports

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,170
and the reports are available at this

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,720
URL from those than the the office of

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,550
cyber infrastructure started creating

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,160
vision and strategy reports for each of

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,480
these areas and we're in kind of in the

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,600
middle of this process we haven't done

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,010
all of it yet but but there's reports

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,800
for computing infrastructure for

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,240
software and for data and then in

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,640
software I think we're kind of leading

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,140
the way in terms of creating a document

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,090
that we call implementation of the

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,700
software vision which is intended to

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,500
tell people if you want to do software

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,450
in some area here's where you should be

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,580
proposing it and here's here's kind of

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:50,590
what we are what we're looking for so so

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,570
the software vision just to mention a

00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,770
few pieces it says that NSF will will

00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,600
take a leadership role in providing

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,760
software is enabling infrastructure and

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,670
promoting software is an important

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,260
component the idea of this is to advance

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,460
the use and development of new software

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,690
and to promote the ubiquitous

00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,700
integration of scientific software

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,680
across all disciplines alright so I

00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,350
think this is in some ways this is kind

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,790
of I don't know not not tremendously

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,810
exciting because it's kind of like mom

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,120
and apple pie it's just saying

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,530
everything but but then when you look at

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,670
what actually needs to be done then we

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,040
get into some details that are more

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,680
interesting and so we we think

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,500
of software and these other areas is

00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,150
really having five components so the in

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,310
some ways the central component is to

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,290
create and maintain a software in this

00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,030
case ecosystem that provides the

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,430
capability is to advance and accelerate

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,500
scientific inquiry you could take away

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,360
software you could put in hardware and

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,470
these slides would be valid for a

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,350
different area i'm just going to use

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,690
software is the example so in order to

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,370
have this ecosystem we had a

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,200
foundational research that's coming in

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,610
in order to bring in new elements into

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,740
the ecosystem so we think of the

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,800
ecosystem in some very very loosely

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,720
biologically inspired term as the set of

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,170
activities that are going on and we need

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,820
new things to come into the area and and

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,320
then once we have the ecosystem we

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,540
actually need to be able to use it to

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,320
enable the science and engineering

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:14,860
Discovery we have lots of different

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,360
issues about policy and so so there's

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,890
lots of questions that need to come in

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,720
in terms of how to actually how to make

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,210
the ecosystem work and how to make sure

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,280
that people can use it effectively and

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,860
there's issues about academic culture

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,270
open dissemination and use

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,190
reproducibility and trust curation

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,320
sustainability governance citation

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,020
stewardship and attribution of

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,550
authorship that all i would say have

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,700
policy needs that haven't been addressed

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,080
at this point and then finally we have

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,630
the education piece as i mentioned

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:47,080
before so we need the ecosystem to help

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,480
develop and sustain the next generation

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,800
workforce but we also need the next

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,360
generation workforce to be able to

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,890
actually work in this area and to keep

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,870
the ecosystem growing in to keep new

00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:01,860
components coming in so so what we're

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:04,060
doing in what was OC I that's now a CI

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm just going to kind of go through a

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,540
couple things fairly quickly we have

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,910
some kind of foundational research where

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,310
we're looking for people to test out new

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,840
algorithms and new ideas we have

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,820
something called computational and data

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,710
enabled science and engineering where

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,210
people that have these ideas that have

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,320
been tested out one to see if they can

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,650
actually be used to solve particular

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,080
problems and and once they can be used

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,040
to solve a particular problem then we

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,250
want to turn them into infrastructure

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,530
and give people funds to to sustain them

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,740
to maintain them to to keep addressing

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,410
community requirements as they

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,730
come up so this is kind of the variety

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,470
of things we have I'm just going to talk

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,640
about this piece primarily as the

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:46,610
infrastructure piece here so so we have

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,260
a program called SI 2 and in that we

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,940
have a bunch of different activities we

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,450
have at the smallest level software

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,950
elements which are projects that are up

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,840
to three years up to half a million

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,160
dollar is usually one or two p is a

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,110
couple of grad students something like

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,600
that building some some relatively small

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,610
bits of software again with a defined

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,860
user community with a defined purpose

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,660
but building it and supporting it and

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,900
making sure that a community actually is

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,550
happy with it we have software

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,380
frameworks which are not necessarily

00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,250
frameworks but that's the word we use

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,440
for something that's bigger than

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,320
elements but it's something that's

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,250
incorporating multiple elements or

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,860
incorporating multiple pieces of

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,640
technology in some sense multiple p is

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,309
maybe up to five p is up to five years

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,820
funding that is up to I think up to 5

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:36,200
million okay yeah I put to a million a

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,179
year sorry we just we only think of

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,370
numbers as single numbers because we try

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,870
to give out money and then and then not

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,929
have to keep giving it out gradually a

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:49,160
year after year so so yeah so up to five

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,480
million over five years and in elements

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,330
could be integrated into frameworks

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,740
potentially then kind of at the at the

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,390
top level in some sense we have

00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,220
institutes and so the idea of

00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,780
Institute's is that they're they're

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,820
providing some kind of central mechanism

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,460
to make frameworks and elements more

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,800
effective to build communities to keep

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,570
communities working together these may

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,090
not be communities that are associated

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,100
with a particular software package they

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,500
could be communities like people doing

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,970
water system modeling that have a

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,559
variety of different packages and we

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,980
want to make those packages interoperate

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,320
and work together or something like that

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,520
as we go up in size we have again this

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,830
kind of integration that's happening

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,059
across we also have hopefully larger and

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,510
larger communities that are being

00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:35,000
affected by these projects and then and

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,760
then finally we have the idea of reuse

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,260
so the elements are being reused kind of

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
going across but the elements hopefully

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,500
also are being reused by projects

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,690
outside right the frameworks are being

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,279
used reused by projects outside the

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,320
Institute's are working with other

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,929
with other people outside of NSF as well

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,059
so this is kind of just a picture of

00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,539
what the the software the SI 2 program

00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:59,090
is doing let's see i'm not sure what

00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:02,179
part of this i want to talk about we

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,950
funded about 50 projects in the the

00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,129
element and the framework size over the

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:09,169
past two years we have a focused

00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:11,749
solicitation with the chemistry division

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:13,489
and with the UK epsrc where we're

00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:16,099
funding collaborations and computational

00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:17,929
chemistry there's a solicitation that's

00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:20,599
currently open for more elements and

00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:23,960
frameworks with proposals due march 19th

00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,509
i believe so so if anybody has a great

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,999
idea and what's to work really fast

00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:31,539
there's still an opportunity in terms of

00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:34,580
the Institute's we've had 13

00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:36,499
conceptualization Awards put out so far

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,450
conceptualization awards are basically

00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:40,039
half a million for one year and they're

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,440
kind of like planning grants for people

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,729
to to work with their communities to try

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,339
to understand exactly what the

00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,629
communities need to figure out who they

00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:49,669
are not who they don't have in their

00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:52,399
team that they should have to do other

00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:55,159
things like that and we have a second

00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:57,679
solicitation that's closed now but we'll

00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,499
probably funding a few more of these in

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,749
the near term and we will hopefully have

00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:05,960
a solicitation for full institutes in

00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:08,899
late fy14 which is about a year and a

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,839
half from now we're working with with

00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:13,700
China as well the National sounds nine

00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,979
sorry national science foundation of

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,700
china or NSF see we have a partnership

00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:21,169
with them where we have a small set of

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,589
initial projects that we're funding and

00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:27,289
this new solicitation here is open to

00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:28,789
international partnerships and NSF c has

00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,309
a due date that's exactly the same as

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:32,599
ours and so we're looking for

00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:34,609
partnerships their proposals there that

00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:36,649
are Chinese in the US team doing

00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:38,239
something together we're happy with

00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:40,249
other countries as well we just haven't

00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:41,719
done the coordination as well as I

00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:44,210
mentioned we've kind of coordinated an

00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:45,469
individual basis with the UK we're

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,809
talking with France about doing

00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:49,099
something maybe in mathematics so so

00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,389
we're looking for opportunities to work

00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,580
with other people because we recognize

00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:55,049
that that software isn't developed just

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,389
in one place but it's

00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:59,940
I would say that it's very painful to do

00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:02,100
these international collaborations in

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,600
terms of our management it's equally

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,230
painful for you to do them in terms of

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,850
your actual work so and then finally I

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,200
guess I just want to say there was a URL

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,570
down here at the bottom that has a list

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,690
of all the projects we've funded so this

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:19,559
is the roughly 50 of these the roughly

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,509
15 of these I know this is something

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,220
that I'd be interested in talking to

00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:25,259
people maybe afterwards is one of the

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,730
questions we have is right now this is

00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,869
kind of it's a list of projects that

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,450
says project name p I name some keywords

00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:34,499
URL where you can pick up the software a

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,749
link to an abstract that talks about

00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:38,159
what the project's trying to do we don't

00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:40,169
really have a good sense of actually how

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,669
this should be organized or how it

00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:43,139
should be searchable or how we should be

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:45,779
connecting it with other open source

00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:47,549
projects or other software projects so

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,279
ideas on things like that I'd be happy

00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:52,169
to talk with anybody about afterwards

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,059
we're kind of basically just starting

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,559
with what we can but we recognize that

00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:00,029
this probably isn't where we need to be

00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:01,230
in the long term okay so um so for

00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,059
people that have proposed into this

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,100
there's at least a couple of people from

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,169
universities here it's worth I think

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,389
talking about actually how we how we run

00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,739
things internally and I hope this is

00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:13,710
interesting to people that actually

00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:15,600
aren't going to be proposing as well but

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,799
we have a cross NSF software working

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,859
group that has members from all the

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:25,649
directorate's so from biology physics

00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:27,899
chemistry geology engineering and that

00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,730
group decides basically how this program

00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:31,320
fits within us with other programs when

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,850
we wrote this again this document trying

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,730
to tell people how all the software

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,409
programs fit together we discuss

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,879
solicitations and we determine which

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,320
groups are going to participate in each

00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:42,869
which means basically who's going to put

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,029
money into each and then we work

00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:48,960
together to do reviews and when we work

00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:50,999
together to fund proposals and and so

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,350
let me talk about the funding proposals

00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,429
park for a minute because I think again

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,659
this is something that's interesting

00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:59,340
that doesn't really get discussed very

00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,869
much I'm going to assume that a proposal

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,909
we have a proposal that's reviewed

00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:04,139
strongly because otherwise we don't

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,609
really have to make much of a decision

00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:07,230
and it's pretty easy not to worry about

00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:08,060
but if we start with something that

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,010
reviews well that I

00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,870
to start kind of doing matchmaking which

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,850
means i have to find program officers in

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,380
areas that will be interested in this

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,120
project that have money that will want

00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,860
to support this project all right and

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,030
that's basically because i can't support

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,790
everything i need to work with other

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:26,630
people around on itself so if a biology

00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:28,310
project comes in i will try to support

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,080
some of it but i'll need the biology

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,400
program officers also to one to support

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,870
some of it and if they aren't going to

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,280
support it that i'm going to wonder why

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,510
not and i'm going to wonder if it's

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,650
something that I should be supporting by

00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:41,210
myself or not so so I want to find

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,770
program officers that have funds and

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,830
convince them this is a good way to

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,810
spend their funds if we have a project

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,850
that's what I will call a unit

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,460
disciplinary project a bioinformatics

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,830
application as an example and then I'll

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,540
probably try to work with a a single

00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,670
program officer who either will like the

00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,810
program proposal or not and if they like

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,080
it will try to fund it if they don't

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,640
it'll probably be dead at that point if

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,960
we have a multidisciplinary project

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,240
right that's going across different

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,130
disciplines then I'm going to work with

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,690
multiple program officers and in this

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,400
case actually things are easier for me

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,590
because if one of them isn't interested

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,760
I still have more and and it's likely we

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,880
can get some funds and we can go ahead

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,650
with the project if we have an omni

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,820
disciplinary project alright so I'm just

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,900
making up words here so I hope this

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:31,370
doesn't bother anybody okay so just as

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,420
an example a web server or a library I'm

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,610
going to try to work with all the

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,740
program officers but what I'm going to

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,240
be told is that it's not my problem it's

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,180
not a biology thing it's your problem

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,920
you do infrastructure you pay for it so

00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,230
it's so it ends up being kind of

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,120
interesting at that point as well so in

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,000
some sense just as as advice for people

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,770
that are writing proposals it's good to

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
have some focus because if you don't

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,740
have some focus it makes it very hard

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,740
for me to get funding from other areas

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,350
in all cases there's a need to forecast

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,300
impact and in some cases we can say that

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,880
past performance can predict future

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,280
results all right somebody proposes a

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,530
project and they say I've been working

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,390
on the software for three years I've got

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,160
this user community all right that helps

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,900
me say okay I know that there is a user

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,550
community it's maybe it's going to grow

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,539
maybe it's not but at least I know that

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,090
it's there if it's a new project

00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,710
it's very hard for the team to make an

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,179
argument that says we know that people

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,220
need this even though nobody who's been

00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,299
using it yet all right so there's kind

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,619
of a question there and this is

00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,659
important for us to try to figure out

00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:36,350
and it's important for the community to

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:39,029
try to figure out is is how do you know

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,259
when you've written software who's using

00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,330
it and what they're doing with it and

00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:44,249
before you've written it how do you know

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,649
that somebody's going to use it and so

00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:49,470
I'm going to try to look at the the

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:51,479
first part of that so so just how do we

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,649
measure impact or how do how do you

00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:56,039
people that write software measure

00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:57,690
impact at least in NSF so just as an

00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,070
example we have somebody that's

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,739
developing an open-source physics

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,539
simulation so so there's different

00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,830
things that they could count all right

00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,809
they could count how many people

00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,759
download it and this is the thing that's

00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:11,009
easiest to measure and probably has the

00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,649
least value they could count how many

00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:15,509
contributors do they have they could

00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:17,849
count how many uses of the software are

00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:20,549
there they could count how many papers

00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:22,169
site the software how many papers that

00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:24,029
site the software are themselves cited

00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:26,009
all right so there's a kind of a variety

00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:28,080
of things that you can look at and as we

00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,519
go down this we go from easiest to

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,769
measure to hardest to measure and we go

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,509
from least value to most value and so

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:37,049
this is I think there's a real challenge

00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:39,059
here in terms of what's the what are the

00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,320
right things to do and and how do we do

00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,899
them what's the infrastructure that

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,369
actually enables this to happen another

00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:47,700
example is the developer of an

00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:49,019
open-source math library so so it's

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,210
possible that the metrics that they're

00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:52,919
looking at are similar but the citations

00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,289
are less likely all right so if you're

00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,879
doing I don't know if you're doing an

00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,080
earth science application it's pretty

00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,759
unlikely that you're going to cite the

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,960
math library that you used or the

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,149
particular version of their particular

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,679
developer all right so the further you

00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:09,450
get into infrastructure the less likely

00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:11,099
you are to be cited is a problem and in

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,769
what if users don't actually download

00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:15,389
this so so how do we measure it then so

00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:17,460
maybe it's part of a distribution that

00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:19,320
we don't really have any sense of it

00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,080
might be pre-installed in an HP SI

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,639
system it might be part of a cloud image

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,229
it might be a service that people are

00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,609
disconnecting too all right so there's a

00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:28,730
lot of questions here about how we

00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:31,880
actually measure usage and how we

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,490
your impact so so what I want to give

00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,010
you is a vision for some things that we

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,290
might do and you can tell me that this

00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,880
makes no sense you can tell me this is a

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,040
great idea and you want to work on it

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,000
and I'll say good write a proposal and

00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,260
let's see if we can give you some money

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,460
for it or something else so so I'm going

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,280
to start off by saying that we've got

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:55,669
products and to me products are our

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:58,100
software papers datasets something like

00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:01,090
that and I'd like to have some way that

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:04,100
they're registered when they're produced

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,630
and in that one of the things that goes

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,210
along with the registration is a credit

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,370
map so the person that registers the

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,559
software the paper or the data set

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,390
basically gives a weighted list of

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,429
contributors along with that

00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,470
registration all right so they say these

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:20,330
are the people that worked on it this

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,880
person gets twenty percent of the credit

00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,350
this paper that i read gets ten percent

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,150
of the credit the software that I use

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,950
gets thirty percent of the credit all

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,720
right so some all right some way of

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,950
having a person decide this because I

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,950
don't think it can be done automatically

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,990
so the output of this is a DUI some kind

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,660
of a digital object identifier that's a

00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:45,260
marker for that software that paper that

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,880
product that's unique and the thing

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,730
that's nice about this is this then can

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,350
lead to transitive credit right so so

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,540
transitive credit for example if we have

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,490
paper one that says 25 percent of the

00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,080
credit goes to software a and we have

00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,000
software a says that ten percent of the

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,740
credit goes to library X right we can

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,240
now say library X gets two point five

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,299
percent in the credit for paper one

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,590
right so we can actually start going

00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,809
down two things and say how are these

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,040
things being used and it kind of gets

00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:11,960
around this problem where infrastructure

00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,220
doesn't get cited because the thing that

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,870
gets built from the infrastructure can

00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,240
cite the infrastructure and and we can

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,620
keep building up so so this is something

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,900
that I would really like to try to

00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,540
figure out some way of doing I don't

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:27,049
actually know how to but it would help

00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:29,299
developers who right now would like to

00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:32,570
be able to say in universities my tools

00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:33,830
are widely used give me tenure or NSF

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,210
should fund my tool maintenance because

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,410
there's lots of people that need it and

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,299
there's lots of important science that's

00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,650
happening and right now as I said before

00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:41,330
we don't have a good way of doing this

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,920
of

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,080
it's very hard to make a case for either

00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,000
of these things now and so the fact that

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,460
you can't actually get credit for what

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,510
you've done leads to lots of issues in

00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:57,620
terms of career paths and tenure and all

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:59,360
sorts of things raises an industry so um

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,370
so those of issues with this all right

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,480
so this is I don't have been talking

00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,650
about this kind of on and off for a

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,110
couple of years but not really very

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,360
seriously and so the issues that come up

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,890
are their social issues right so the

00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,020
people that are involved have to trust

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,710
the person that's doing the registration

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,120
to actually give out credit fairly I

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,650
mean I think this actually works today

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,030
it works for papers today reasonably

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,950
well we have a culture that accepts

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,470
citation and it seems to seems to work

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,610
okay it seems to work okay an open

00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,290
source where people seem to give credit

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,210
to to their developers and their

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:33,320
committers and don't say the reason this

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:36,050
couldn't work there was a question about

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,990
how it actually do this waiting when you

00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,610
have complex projects if you can just

00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,670
wait until the end of the project and

00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,900
say yeah I think this person did some

00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,070
part of the work and this person did

00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,420
some part of the worker if you need some

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,820
kind of tools to help you accumulate

00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,610
some of this data along the way I don't

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,290
know the answer to that and then and

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,240
then technologically there's this kind

00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,220
of question about about how do we

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,490
actually registered products and how

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,200
would we register the credit app all

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,990
right so what is there a system or their

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,610
multiple systems do they link together

00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,620
and this actually ties into provenance

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,720
as well and because every time that you

00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,130
do something in theory you want to know

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,900
how you've done it in the tools that you

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,450
used but we don't have a way of doing

00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,830
that in a general way either right now

00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:21,590
if we could do that we could do this or

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,050
vice versa so I don't know so I think

00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,040
this is kind of an interesting question

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,320
but I don't know what the what the

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,840
answer is Indiana saying right what's

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,830
what's the system what are the interface

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:38,440
is how do the systems work together so

00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:38,440
kind of just going on sure

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,480
if you're doing this a range of values

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:47,460
so instead of saying yeah that was a

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,230
sixty percent you know maybe just say

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,940
I'd say fifteen twenty five percent so

00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:04,440
that way you'd have some have some error

00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:10,140
have some valium era cars could be hip

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,730
certainly possible so um so so for again

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,470
thinking about this technologically then

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,660
the one question is is there a way of

00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,070
recording project product usage all

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,960
right so you could say after you've

00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:22,500
finished right you finish doing some

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,720
project I use this tool 25 times and or

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,610
or vice versa can you say that the

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,680
project that I've used the tool that I

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,300
built was used some number of times all

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,430
right so so there's a question about

00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,560
where product usage could be recorded I

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,120
think both the developer and the user

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,660
really would like to be able to track

00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:42,120
usage of tools there's privacy issues

00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,560
about this in some cases I think some of

00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,670
this could be done in the u.s. today but

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,460
probably couldn't be done in Europe

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,080
today as an example I think there's

00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,850
there's competitive issues about this

00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,200
all right in some cases people are happy

00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,480
to know who's using their tools in other

00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,680
cases it may be something that aren't

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,150
that a tool developer doesn't actually

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,420
want the knowledge of that to be

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,340
Cheyenne widely shared right we could

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,840
build tools that have kind of a phone

00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,210
home mechanism that when they're used

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,430
they actually talk to some server and

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,710
make some registration which leads to

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,120
questions about how accurate that would

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,850
be and if it could be hacked and other

00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,160
things but then there's also questions

00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,050
about what about usage in terms of

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,670
products like data sets all right so

00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:23,280
it's not really clear what using a data

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,840
set means and how that could trigger our

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,910
usage record with software it's a bit

00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,590
easier with a paper or you can imagine

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,710
viewing the paper trick or something or

00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,970
something like that so so I think

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,820
there's a question about can generally

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,230
be developed to do some of this and if

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,790
somebody could develop some general code

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,250
then would people incorporate it into

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:44,430
their packages I don't know this is a

00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,990
question as I mentioned before I think

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,450
this is all tied to Providence which

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:51,920
which is another open I think large open

00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,920
question today in science at least

00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,560
and then yeah so then with user input we

00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:59,750
could tie later products to usage all

00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,920
right one of the issues is that is that

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,240
when you're doing something in science

00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,160
you may not know what your outcome is

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,990
going to be ahead of time all right so

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,130
there's some things where you're you're

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,260
trying something you're experimenting

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,340
and after you're done then you can go

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,080
back and try to figure out what you've

00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:16,490
done in other cases it's the other way

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:21,260
around right which is what I'm saying so

00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:23,930
okay so so in my mind actually I can

00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,630
imagine this kind of grand future system

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,710
where all the stuff is done but but I

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,840
don't know actually how we would get

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,250
there all right because because I don't

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,040
know what the increments would be in

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,510
order to move this at this point so so I

00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,720
think this is a question and I don't

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:40,700
know the answer um I do want to say

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,620
though that that the lack of credit for

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,560
things I think is a much larger problem

00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:47,840
than people often think that it is the

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,540
lack of credit I think is a disincentive

00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,980
for sharing software and data today if

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,720
there is a mechanism that would provide

00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,400
credit it would remove this disincentive

00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,310
as well as adding an incentive and if

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,270
anybody knows those lewin this is kind

00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,900
of coming out of his force field

00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:04,100
analysis so it's I I don't know it's one

00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,780
of those things we're making a small

00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,250
change actually can can remove a

00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,070
disincentive ending Korean dad and

00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,380
incentive and make a large impact so

00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:14,270
other things with this so for commercial

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,320
tools we track credit by money as was

00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:19,850
said in the talk this morning but this

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,500
doesn't really help figure out what

00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,300
things were used for all right we could

00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,710
we could say what value people put on

00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,950
tools but that doesn't actually help in

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,110
the science case in the NSF case as well

00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,160
and and it's not clear actually that

00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,890
paying for things encourages

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:38,030
collaboration so so again these are just

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:40,700
questions but but type of to this is a

00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:44,510
question about an economic model so

00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:46,730
right now NSF gives out money for grants

00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,840
we could imagine some kind of future

00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,060
world where we give out some kind of

00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,560
tokens for grants and people that get

00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,270
those tokens then can give them to

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,500
people that they're depending on all

00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,500
right give them to people that they're

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,460
using their software using their papers

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,910
right so we could build some kind of

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,420
economic like model into NSF which we

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,700
wanted to if we chose to we could do

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,140
44 allocations of computer time as well

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,549
all right so there's there's lots of

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,780
things that could be done it's it's not

00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:11,280
at all clear to me which of these

00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,849
actually should be done or which would

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,359
make sense at this point okay so so let

00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:20,549
me move on slightly so let's talk about

00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,369
some stuff actually so when I was asked

00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:24,630
to do this in December between christmas

00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,369
and new years i spent some time when

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,309
almost nobody else was at NSF reading

00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:30,510
patchy foundation documents and found

00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,559
them to actually to be quite interesting

00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,799
and a bunch of stuff that i wouldn't

00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,630
have seen otherwise so so sustainability

00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:37,950
i'm going to talk about a couple of

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,660
things and I think maybe tie to apache

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,329
foundation so sustainability is one of

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:44,490
them my definition of sustainability as

00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,960
a program officer is how are you going

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,900
to pay for your software after I stop

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,460
paying you all right it's a slightly

00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,530
different question than I think the

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,319
Apache would put it but but this is my

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,000
version and so and so I think there's

00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:58,589
questions that about what a support mean

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,470
so if you're going to support your

00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:02,880
software what right what does that mean

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,680
so I so I would say there's a question

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,750
about can I build it and run it on my

00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,849
current system so does the software

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,970
adapt as the system's underlies the

00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:13,829
underlying systems change do I

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,760
understand what your software does so

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:18,030
are you continuing to provide

00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,770
documentation and training for it does

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,630
it do what it's supposed to do correctly

00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,430
all right so are you tracking bugs and

00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:27,059
fixing them do you have some kind of

00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:28,740
verification and validation sweet does

00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,390
it do what I want all right so are you

00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,829
tracking my requirements as they come in

00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,020
or other user requirements as they come

00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:37,950
in and trying to update your software to

00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,380
meet new requirements and and as your

00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,240
software changing is it something that's

00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,470
just fixed that's that you just need to

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,859
support or is it something that really

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:50,700
is developing over time so so I think a

00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:52,349
question that I would ask is is what are

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,480
the lessons from Apache that we should

00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,940
be bringing into NSF and into our

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,920
software to help here and again this is

00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,020
these are this is a question this is not

00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,119
an answer so I'd be happy to talk about

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,290
this afterwards and my email address

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,950
will be at the end and I'd be happy to

00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:10,950
have ideas from people also its

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,299
governance is another issue so so I

00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,010
think we we care about governance

00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:16,359
because it tells users and contributors

00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,880
how the project makes decisions

00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:21,779
how they can be involved in that process

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,160
so so the issues here to me seem to be

00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,720
who is the community in some sense is

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,130
that the developers or the users are

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,720
both and it seems like there's different

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,599
answers at least for NSF software in

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,609
different cases there's what's the model

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,220
of governance from the dictatorship to

00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:37,539
the meritocracy to anything else there's

00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,420
what's the development model itself

00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,980
which seems to be tied to the to the

00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,160
governance model in some cases but not

00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:48,160
necessarily always and and again how

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,079
right how can Apache help NSF figure out

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,920
right what the what the issues are here

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,739
and what some good answers might be one

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,890
one option is is that science projects

00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:01,779
in general I think are smaller than than

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,489
most of the Apache projects and so it

00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:04,960
would be interesting to know if there's

00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:06,460
differences between small Apache

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,660
projects and large ones in terms of

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,880
governance or in terms of sustainability

00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,319
and and what happens and if some of

00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,150
those smaller projects have lessons that

00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:17,079
could could benefit some of the science

00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,960
projects that we have let's see a few

00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,539
other questions so does the Apache way

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,319
work for science I think is one that I

00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:27,880
don't know the answer to right is it it

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,140
could be that the underlying tools are

00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,519
useful for science and for their

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,200
applications and that's probably the

00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,640
base case that will assume is is true

00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,950
now because we have good examples of

00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,480
that but does the general model really

00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,980
work for science for something for

00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,749
things that are just science not not

00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:45,579
underlying tools I don't know right how

00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:48,339
many users or developers are needed for

00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:51,670
success so if we have a science project

00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:53,049
that has has two developers is it

00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:59,499
possible for that to be successful over

00:42:53,049 --> 00:43:00,940
time and right in why or why not the

00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:02,890
incubator model is I think is very

00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,119
interesting and I wonder if there's

00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,309
something like that that would work for

00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,289
science software in general if so who

00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:12,489
would actually be running it and who

00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:13,599
would be advising or mentoring or is

00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,920
there some version of that that would

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,749
make more sense for software it's not

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,839
the not the process as it is but some

00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:21,430
version of the process there's another

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,300
question that comes up actually a lot in

00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:27,510
science software today which is

00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,190
is is what is open-source mean and some

00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,600
people think of open source meaning that

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,640
the sources available so that i can

00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,430
understand what's going on and other

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,230
people think of open source meaning that

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:39,480
that i can reuse and develop based on

00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,640
that and and i would say that the

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,920
definition that that we use an NSF is

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,390
not completely clear and the definition

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:54,330
of again in proposals is definitely not

00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:56,520
clear okay so so just to close up last

00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:58,080
few questions on so a bunch of general

00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,660
questions I'm so I'm asking lots of

00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,070
questions more than giving answers but

00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,580
hopefully this is of interest to people

00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:07,110
here so so software that's intended to

00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,930
be infrastructure has challenges that

00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:12,030
are different from other software so i

00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,560
would say unlike in business having more

00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,820
users means more work this is something

00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,700
that probably people here are common

00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,230
with are familiar with right that the

00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,360
more users you get the more support you

00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,490
have to give but you don't get any money

00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,440
to help and in the case of NSF we have

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,940
this issue that right the developers are

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,100
actually expecting money to pay for

00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,230
their time so there's a little bit of a

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,640
question there on the last twenty

00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,640
percent of making something really

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,650
useful reusable can take eighty percent

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:43,110
of the effort and particularly in

00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:44,460
science there's often a i would say an

00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,690
understanding that you write the paper

00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,310
that proves that it works and then

00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,960
you're done you don't actually make it

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,880
usable necessarily by anybody else

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,880
alright so how do we encourage people to

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,380
take those next few steps all right so

00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,160
what can we do to make these things

00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:01,200
easier in terms of just the environment

00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,180
of what we're supporting i think one of

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,560
the questions we have is what fraction

00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,300
of fun should we be spending on things

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,990
that exist and just supporting them

00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,220
maintaining them versus new things i I

00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:15,450
don't know what the right numbers are at

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:18,720
this point right how do we decide when

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,490
to stop supporting something I think

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,440
this is a another question alright we

00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,170
it's I think it's pretty easy for us to

00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,010
say that something new should come in

00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,540
all right there's something new that has

00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,120
lots of users and we want to support it

00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,920
but when do we when do something old say

00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,490
not have enough users that it's not but

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,660
we're not going to support it any longer

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,230
how do we encourage reuse and

00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,990
discouraged

00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,210
allocation I will say just as a kind of

00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,240
a small comment that as I've listened to

00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:47,400
the talks in the science track all right

00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,890
it seems like there's been at least kind

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,080
of two different workflow like

00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:54,090
discussions that have happened as I've

00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,190
heard from somebody at NSF NSF has

00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,240
supported something like a hundred and

00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,300
forty three different workflow

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,869
technologies over different times all

00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,670
right I don't know how many more we need

00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:08,520
and I don't know how to make people stop

00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,900
using stop building new ones or how to

00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,800
try to encourage people to stop building

00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,270
new ones okay and finally um how do we

00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,130
more effectively support career paths

00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,650
for software developers particularly in

00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,540
universities and labs I think this is

00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,369
this is really a big issue so there's

00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,070
there's a tremendous problem that people

00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:27,090
come in well actually there's another

00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,160
there's one of the problems is that

00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,570
we're getting more and more postdocs but

00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,030
if we ignore that as a problem we get

00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:36,240
people that come in to two universities

00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,520
I think this happens at JPL as well and

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,050
labs they come in their software

00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,510
developers they do a good job for some

00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:44,310
period of time and then they decide that

00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,080
that really there's not a career path as

00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,960
a software developer for them at that

00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,130
place they're not a faculty member

00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,630
they're not going to become a principal

00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,730
investigator at JPL whatever the

00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,690
equivalent is and do they want to stay

00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,010
there or do they want to go somewhere

00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,359
else where there is a career path and

00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,550
there's going to be increasing rewards

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,080
over time and often they go somewhere

00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,900
else and we lose them and so the

00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,580
question is kind of how do we how do we

00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,060
build something that makes them want to

00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:10,290
stay in in let's say academic in the

00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,810
largest sense environments and

00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,890
non-commercial environments I think this

00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,540
is another question where anywhere

00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,700
Apache actually in the open source

00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,050
community kind of has an answer but I'm

00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:24,330
not quite sure that I know what it is

00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:27,869
exactly so okay so finally if you want

00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:29,790
to do something we've got again a list

00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:32,850
of the SI to software projects we have

00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:34,680
in the Institute's take a look at it if

00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,960
you want to be involved in one I think

00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,430
people would be welcome there's there's

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,770
always a need for more help in terms of

00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,150
software in terms of development in

00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,410
terms of documentation in terms of

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,470
training in terms of all these issues so

00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:50,119
right so now I sound like I'm Apache

00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:51,200
oh yeah and and then finally tell me

00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:53,330
what we should be doing differently at

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,000
NSF I kind of tried to tell you what we

00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:59,840
are doing and what questions we have so

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,880
so tell me here send me email whatever

00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,349
you'd like so thank you for for the

00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,440
invitation to come and thank you for

00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,440
listening

00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:30,140
there may be a really brief and through

00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:35,540
this but I was just taking the usual or

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:37,309
the classic in SF model is that tenure

00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,530
track faculty people are submitting

00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:41,690
proposals in SF reviews them and they

00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:45,589
give the grants and so forth and so it's

00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:48,319
really a collaboration between NSF

00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:51,260
program officers and and faculty to do

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:53,150
academic research of a you know a

00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,700
three-year scale which is about the

00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:58,160
lifespan of a grad student career

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:06,170
hopefully you know for for finishing it

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:08,900
a PhD has it been in as oci has evolved

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,339
and other parts of NSF have evolved it

00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,930
seems like these are becoming more

00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:15,500
partnerships that should be occurring

00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:18,670
between the NSF and the campus CIO or

00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:24,170
CTO or whoever and there should be more

00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:26,930
instead of instead of more of the so

00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:30,140
many proposals that are software focus

00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:32,329
coming from it coming out you know

00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,059
bubbling up from different random places

00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:37,540
within university being more of a

00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:40,790
strategic coordination with the campus

00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,930
CIO who is responsible for working for

00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,430
running that infrastructure that

00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:45,799
university or the that consorcio

00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:49,339
university is your building discussions

00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:52,790
or research reports or anything looking

00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:54,290
at things from that point of view yeah

00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,750
so I guess there's a few different

00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,280
comments that i can make i don't know of

00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,710
any anything in particular that's

00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,349
addressing what you're saying i think i

00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:05,990
would say that there's there's an issue

00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:08,119
that there are an awful lot of different

00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:11,119
campus models alright so in some case

00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:13,099
the CIO has some role in research in

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,500
many cases the CIO has no role in

00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:17,450
research and doesn't want to so it's

00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,210
it's hard to imagine exactly a model

00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,770
that's going to fit everybody i think

00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:25,190
another part of the answer to this is

00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:28,790
that is that of all the things that we

00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:31,730
want to do that we would like one saying

00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:33,319
let me say that again all the ways that

00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:36,349
we would like the world to be different

00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,720
at NSF an awful lot of them are things

00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:41,040
that we

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,570
and universities have to do so so the

00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,360
coordination inside a university is

00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,950
something that we don't have any way of

00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,780
asking for even though we would like to

00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:52,140
have I would say more coordination in a

00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:55,880
number of universities another thing

00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:59,700
just to mention is that NSF has a

00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:03,060
granted proposal guideline book that

00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,680
basically says that if any person is

00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,040
going to be funded for more than two

00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:11,160
months during a year with NSF funds they

00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:16,440
need to justify why that's needed which

00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:17,790
makes it actually very hard to well

00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,490
there's actually kind of a two-sided

00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:22,770
piece of that one is that it's is that

00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:24,390
people that are not faculty members that

00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,790
don't have nine months of their salary

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:31,290
being paid by the university have a hard

00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:33,450
time getting funded by NSF in some cases

00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:35,400
because of that and it depends on where

00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:37,620
you are so in OC I generally we don't

00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,510
really care about that very much but in

00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:43,410
other parts of NSF they do care about it

00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:45,870
a lot and it's a balance because because

00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:48,840
if we're going to fund ten people that

00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:51,510
are doing software development 12 months

00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,800
out of the year all right then that's

00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,420
only 10 people that we're going to be

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,010
able to support versus if we were going

00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,930
to support faculty members and graduate

00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,790
students we could support some multiple

00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,650
of those number of people and we may get

00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,480
more done we may get less done that's

00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,250
not clear but alright but there's some

00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,690
kind of a balance there about about the

00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:10,470
number of people we support versus how

00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:13,260
we support them and and in the case of

00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:16,110
universities I think the universities

00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,480
have to choose how they're supporting

00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,890
their staff as well and if they are

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,200
supporting their staffer if they're just

00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:24,360
depending on NSF and outside entities to

00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,080
support their stuff so I I don't know

00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,080
what the answer to that is

00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,700
so I like the talk and I think that you

00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,220
present a very sophisticated view of

00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,900
software as an entire ecosystem of

00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:46,530
matters regarding governance education

00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,420
sustainability and so on so one aspect

00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:52,740
that you didn't talk very much about is

00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:56,310
that the compliment to software that

00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:59,220
really remains is ideas so you know

00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:01,170
korba software may be obsolete but

00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,320
there's certain ideas or concepts that

00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:07,160
we can still talk about right so one

00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:11,100
thing that seems to me very valuable is

00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:14,360
to understand what you think from all of

00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:17,820
these oci projects over the years what

00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:21,000
ideas or what concepts are helpful to

00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:23,360
disseminate you know lessons learn from

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,500
things that did not work for science

00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,540
infrastructure things that worked very

00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,270
well for science infrastructure and I

00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,940
think that would be very helpful there

00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:34,950
are several reasons I see a lot of

00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,110
scientists that need this one sliver of

00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,130
functionality and they're just going to

00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,540
build their own and they're going to

00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,740
build it wrong and they're going to

00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,960
build it in a way that's not

00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:45,840
interoperable when they need the second

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,310
sliver of functionality the other reason

00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,250
is that I see a lot of scientists

00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:52,650
developing software themselves so they

00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:55,200
want to build their own and I understand

00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:58,020
that in some sense we would want to

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,760
convey to them what might be a faster

00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,410
way to get to where they need to go or

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,420
deter them from trying to do that

00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:06,300
because they don't see the complexity so

00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:11,520
it seems that maybe you know doing some

00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:13,770
good concerted effort to disseminate you

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,260
know first of all to extract or compile

00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,480
all these big ideas big lessons learned

00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,700
and then really disseminate that to the

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,030
practice of science infrastructure

00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,620
development so that's my question okay

00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,570
yeah so I think that's that's actually

00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,150
it's a very good question actually it's

00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:34,680
an interesting question so I I guess as

00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:36,150
I think about this right so so some

00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,830
things that work are captured in

00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,210
software and that's in some ways that's

00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:43,210
the artifact that carries the lesson

00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,349
and sometimes that's fine in some cases

00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,700
there's something that works that

00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:48,430
doesn't get captured in software gets

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:51,280
captured in a paper and that's probably

00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,869
okay to some extent as well when there's

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,280
something that doesn't work it probably

00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:55,900
never gets captured right because

00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,839
because we don't write papers about

00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:03,220
failures so so I think there's

00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:04,750
definitely some issue about there's

00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,000
there certainly are some mistakes that

00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:08,140
are being made repeatedly because people

00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,660
don't know that they've been made before

00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,560
I guess the other thing that I was

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:16,089
thinking about was numerical recipes so

00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,859
so I think at least for me is a graduate

00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:19,119
student I remember right all right the

00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:21,940
first time that I needed to do something

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,160
some kind of linear algebra i looked at

00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,720
a textbook and i tried to figure out

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,950
okay what's what needs to happen here

00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,080
what's the algorithm then can i write a

00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,520
code for this algorithm and then at some

00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,710
point i found out oh there's this

00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,420
numerical recipes book and it actually

00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:37,180
tells me how to do it and it actually

00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,710
has code as well all right i can type in

00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,970
the code and then and then the code is

00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,609
available online which is even better

00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:43,980
and I could just take the code I mean

00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:46,650
then I got to the point where I realized

00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,880
this is really really bad code actually

00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,990
right it's I mean functionally it does

00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,609
exactly what it should have but it's

00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:54,970
horrible performance and it's not really

00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:56,410
written very clearly and so there's kind

00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,820
of this I don't know in some ways it

00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:00,460
seems like there's this process that

00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:04,720
that you have to well that people do go

00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:06,400
through of right realizing they have a

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,470
need and then trying to figure out like

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,940
what's the theoretical answer this need

00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:13,089
then is there some practical answer that

00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:14,470
I can just use and then no that's not

00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:15,820
exactly the answer I want is there some

00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:19,180
better answer that I can use it really

00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:21,099
does what i want and yeah so I but I

00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:25,359
don't know what the what the way to do

00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:26,980
that is it's yeah it's a good question

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,730
it's something certainly that we should

00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,730
think about how to do

00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,270
very nice talk like fortunate very well

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,950
because like lots of IG audience would

00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:40,109
have benefited lots of like the homework

00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,700
you need and what's relevance and all

00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:43,230
would have been a nice to get some lots

00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,460
of insight because we see these kind of

00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,140
similar questions and I mailing lists

00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,760
all the time debating like you know I

00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,349
don't think so bad she has an answer but

00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,290
they're open questions and they're lots

00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:53,910
of thoughts being leg goes around so one

00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:57,329
thing I was wondering in the SSI program

00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:59,790
like now is this vanessa sses and as a

00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:03,450
size and and so you mentioned about like

00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:05,910
the linkages and also the workflow

00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,740
problem like 150 how do we how do you

00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:09,540
stop it I don't think so in the Apache

00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,400
to like no that's there's a lot of

00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,900
reoccurrence but at least we've seen is

00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,390
there is some kind of a mention like

00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,579
when incubated proposal comes in or what

00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,890
are the Apache projects do you use or

00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:21,660
like there are like revenues here and

00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,250
they're like no basically people like

00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,690
there's no director what like no but

00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,569
people do that in the other one

00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:29,730
basically is very strong with the girl

00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,140
this very disturbed or magnet was

00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,230
administering the G software patches

00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,420
being was commenting that the most

00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,130
successful one were the cross pollinated

00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,690
projects like done across multiple

00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,220
Apache project even though they were

00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:43,619
late to pick up but they were yielded

00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:47,549
more instead of just a task and so on so

00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:49,619
we're in the wandering like no proposals

00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:51,750
or like on in this whole size square

00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:53,549
program like no this reward or like know

00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:55,319
someone because you put out this nice

00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:58,500
token idea before that like you give

00:57:55,319 --> 00:58:00,540
doke and the similar way any thoughts or

00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,309
any plans to first class we bring out

00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:06,740
all I'm probably using this and

00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:13,400
modifying this yeah I don't know what

00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:14,630
thurs dream slice well so I mean so I

00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,770
think that there's I don't know it's

00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,410
interesting to think about this with

00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:19,520
with apache and what we're doing so

00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:22,190
alright so one of the things i guess is

00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:25,790
interesting to me is that apache is an

00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:28,580
Apache seems to be a fairly integrated

00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:31,520
community in some sense right the SI to

00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:34,190
program is a set of P is that all have

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,660
been funded by NSF but it's not clear

00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:37,610
that they're more integrated than there

00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:39,920
any more integrated than that all right

00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:42,140
so I think one one question that I would

00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,140
say is is how do we make the SI 2

00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,550
community more like the Apache community

00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,470
where they right where people know

00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:51,200
what's available and what other people

00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:53,900
have done and and really try to work

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,130
together more closely but then if I kind

00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,500
of keep going from that I would say

00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:59,930
actually well okay so why do we have a

00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,270
an NSF community of developers and

00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,980
apache community of developers and a de

00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,150
community of developers in a european

00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,830
community of developers aren't these

00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,140
aren't these people all kind of trying

00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:10,190
to do the same thing so so i think this

00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,859
gets back actually to this question

00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:15,680
about about in general for open source

00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:17,450
software well let's say opens our

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,520
software although actually strictly

00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,840
we're we're not limited to open source

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,170
software will support things that aren't

00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:28,910
but i'll say open source for the minute

00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:30,440
all right so i don't i don't know some

00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,580
some projects seem to get to this

00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,920
critical mass where everybody knows

00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,840
about them and and they seem to get used

00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,960
either in a certain community or more

00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,210
widely I don't know how that happens and

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,330
I don't know how we can try to encourage

00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,920
that to happen alright so and so I would

00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:49,090
say at least four if we go back to work

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:52,730
flows for in the NSF world there's

00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:55,240
there's probably five to ten workflow

00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:58,040
systems that are fairly widely used

00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,770
right maybe maybe five to ten is a good

00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:04,460
number maybe it should be smaller I

01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:07,460
don't know but I'm not sure that it

01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,930
should be much larger and and when

01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,630
somebody new comes in with a need it's

01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:12,950
not clear to me how they find one of

01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,200
those five to ten things and how they

01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:18,870
decide this is the one that I'm going to

01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,580
or I'm going to build something else so

01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:23,190
I think I I don't know I think there's a

01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,960
lot of communication that doesn't happen

01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:27,720
and I don't really know how to encourage

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,850
it to happen right between again between

01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,340
the developers that we fund and the

01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:38,310
Apache community and in the larger

01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:41,070
community that's comment on that is in

01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:42,390
the battery too I guess the proposal

01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,190
comforting intuition but also there are

01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,750
like frequent word reports going on and

01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:47,400
everything an emphasis is never on the

01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,290
quality of code or anything I just like

01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,330
are you engaging are you welcoming new

01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,860
computers and all where is known as the

01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:54,210
proposal I guess the only chance people

01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,220
try to justify them in the proposal

01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:58,950
wonder if you are funded like no there

01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:01,230
is no I think like no feedback or

01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:05,160
anything that's true right that's a good

01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:07,110
point so in in the element and framework

01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,150
awards that we make their once the award

01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,380
is made it's basically made and the team

01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,300
is going to get their money over the

01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,090
period unless unless something really

01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,410
bad happens for the Institute's we

01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:18,480
actually will probably make those as

01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:19,890
continuing awards where where every year

01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,420
there will be a review and you have to

01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:24,210
pass the review in order to get funded

01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,980
for the next year so that that actually

01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,540
will be a small change there but but

01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,570
you're right i guess the the issue is

01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,570
that

01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:36,770
in some ways the issue is that the

01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,800
Apache foundation in my understanding of

01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:42,190
it is much more I would say is much more

01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:45,740
active than the NSF program management

01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:48,110
group in terms of in terms of working

01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,570
with the projects that are going on all

01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:51,830
right so yeah so we get proposals in we

01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:54,020
have a peer review committee that looks

01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,040
at them and gives them some review and

01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,960
then we decide if we're going to fund

01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,330
them or not but that's yeah and that's

01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,610
kind of the end at that point and even

01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:03,200
the peer review panel I think there are

01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,730
questions about kind of how much they

01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,920
really know about what's going on in

01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,300
other projects so we don't have the

01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,150
equivalent of somebody on the panel

01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,260
that's say an incubation mentor or

01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,430
something like that that really knows

01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:17,120
well here's the things that you should

01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:19,220
be working with and and and can say well

01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,330
please fix this part of your proposal

01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,950
then we'll consider it again that's

01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:24,440
that's not an option we either accept it

01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:28,280
or reject it and if it's rejected then

01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:30,350
it waits a year so it's so so the only

01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:34,850
comment that I had to add to that real

01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:36,380
quick is that so so I think that that's

01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:38,450
precisely the way that it works at

01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:40,220
Apache which is because it's it's a home

01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,480
for software communities but the

01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,860
community is the more important part

01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,780
that they're actually tracking the

01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:47,270
metrics for you know and everything else

01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,800
which I think you guys want to do you

01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:50,540
know with with the si2 you're trying to

01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,020
grow communities in some sense to around

01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:57,770
software yeah but um you know I would

01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:59,540
also address your point about about

01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,490
apache seeming at least to be you know

01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,350
really interconnected communities like

01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,180
Apache is very interconnected but it's

01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:07,430
also very not interconnected as well

01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,990
there are sets of Apache communities

01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,340
that work together or that know about

01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:13,190
each other or whatever but that's not

01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,630
everybody like you know we started the

01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,550
tikka project or whatever and we

01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:17,690
constantly you know tell people about it

01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,250
or whatever that have never heard about

01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:20,840
it that we find all these places it

01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,130
could still be used in and then we do

01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,200
the same thing in other projects as well

01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:26,180
the thing that connects us together I

01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,530
think at Apache are like you know at

01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,030
least through like these meetings or

01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:30,410
whatever but also through the normative

01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:32,030
ways that we interact on the mailing

01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,800
list the voting and consensus process

01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,560
the meritocracy all the stuff that you

01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,230
had that you did

01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:41,130
diligent job of reading there over the

01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:43,770
good December break so so yeah so I mean

01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:45,480
and you probably I mean it it was by

01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:47,100
design through at least these couple

01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,180
days of tracks here and apache and

01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,680
science that a lot of this stuff was

01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,140
interconnected because it was by design

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,580
to find projects that were together that

01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,130
did that but we could have just as

01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:58,650
easily I mean other tracks here for big

01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:00,060
data or whatever you know they might be

01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,080
a whole bunch of projects that have just

01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,270
heard about each other for the first

01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:06,540
time and are like oh wow too so I think

01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:07,650
I think some of the principles some of

01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,330
the stuff you talked about like treat

01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,100
like triage effectively like when just

01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:12,840
shot a project down and whenever or when

01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:15,590
to think about that a lot of that stuff

01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:18,120
at Apache is driven by social the social

01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:21,090
methodology you know or whatever to you

01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,290
know yeah right so I think that's I mean

01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,530
in some ways that's maybe one of the

01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:26,580
biggest differences is that Apache

01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:29,220
Apache isn't giving out money to all the

01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,720
projects that are in Apache alright and

01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:36,780
we are and our projects are depending on

01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:39,840
us to do that in some sense sorry 11 11

01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,400
last oh sorry oh so defined the ages are

01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,930
you in a position to actually dictate

01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,750
what kind of license or the software

01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:47,370
project should have like you know this

01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:51,000
should be like a very good or license so

01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:55,050
that everybody can use it so so are we

01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,760
in a position to do that yes we can I do

01:04:55,050 --> 01:05:02,420
it yes will I do it no because I don't

01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,420
want to dictate that

01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:16,420
knowledge in some cases yes in other

01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:18,269
cases no so in some cases the the best

01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:21,190
way to get something to be widely used

01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:23,289
is for people to deliver it into a

01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:25,599
commercial package that has a no-cost

01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:27,069
academic license and that's that's the

01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:29,259
way it's going to be most widely used in

01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:30,609
other cases it's the to use the most

01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,259
liberal license possible and to make it

01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:34,390
as open as possible it's I don't think

01:05:32,259 --> 01:05:35,680
that there's a single answer and so

01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:40,089
that's that's one of the things that we

01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:42,009
ask actually in the in the proposals we

01:05:40,089 --> 01:05:43,420
ask people to say what license you're

01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:44,799
going to use how are you going to be

01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,829
distributing your software and why is

01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:52,619
this the best answer for your software

01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:54,880
and and in most of the time it's ninety

01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,890
ninety-five percent plus it's open

01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,749
source and it's usually a fairly open

01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:01,650
license but not always and it's again I

01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:01,650
don't think it's always the right answer

01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,890
pretty much answer a question I guess a

01:06:04,029 --> 01:06:07,930
finer point would be if someone says it

01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:12,160
is open source software can you then

01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:16,599
require them to pick any standard open

01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:21,039
source license we we could do that again

01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:22,599
we I guess we in the process that we go

01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,699
through now when we are actually making

01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:27,339
the awards we ask them which license are

01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:29,079
you going to use and it's it I think

01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:31,630
it's always been a small number within

01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:35,109
like I don't know maybe five different

01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:36,670
licenses that I've seen and and as far

01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:39,729
as I know they've all been officially

01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:41,819
open source standard licenses but thank

01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,819
you

01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:49,190
so just as we're doing this i will say

01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,870
that there's I think the answer that I

01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:52,040
gave on that is actually has a common

01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:54,620
answer for a lot of these things is that

01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,910
I in general for the the projects we get

01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:58,340
and I don't want to mandate what people

01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:59,960
have to do I want to to let people find

01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,790
examples and find the right thing to do

01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,140
and then hopefully educate the reviewer

01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:05,510
community so that they make the best

01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:08,780
decisions and based recommendations but

01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:11,900
go ahead hopefully this is too much of

01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:14,980
an inside question but you know the

01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:17,270
earth cube site is another NSF program

01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:20,210
went to some trouble to set up a ning

01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:24,920
site to and forums and things like that

01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:26,540
to try and be more visible about who the

01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,400
community was and what software was

01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:30,560
available what problems pre poor people

01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,140
were interested in things like that do

01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,560
you see any value and doing anything

01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:38,660
like that for the sty to or read sorry

01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:41,270
the SI squared program which is supposed

01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:44,480
to be a community with a bit different

01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:49,670
focus so potentially I would see value

01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:52,150
in doing that I guess there's a so what

01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:55,430
we've done at this point is this this

01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:58,850
vit da ly link that i had up which is a

01:07:55,430 --> 01:08:00,140
google site so there's i think there's

01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:02,900
value in doing that the question is

01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,490
what's the cost of doing that and is the

01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,900
cost worth the value and i don't know

01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:09,050
the answer to that alright so earth cube

01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:10,370
has has a contractor that built that

01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,630
site and maintains it and there's

01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:13,460
investment that they have to make in

01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,720
order to keep that going and and it's

01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,370
not it's not clear to me if that's

01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,819
worthwhile or not for the for the SI to

01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,819
