Dave Fisher

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Podlings are said to be part of the Clutch. On a daily basis the status of podlings is evaluated from available information. This talk will describe the clutch evaluation process and how that feeds into the Incubator website. Additional topics: Whimsy and Podling information. Bootstrapping a Podling. Updating podling status.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,519
okay i guess i will begin

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,559
um today's talk

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,680
is about hatching the clutch uh the

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,120
clutch is

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,640
um what we term

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,719
the podlings in the incubator

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
so in the incubator you know the

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,840
projects come in and they're

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,800
called podlings and essentially they're

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
eggs who are hatching and that's the

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
terminology

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,559
so um a little bit about myself i'm um

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
i have my own little consulting firm

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,920
right now called dave fisher technology

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,280
i am a member of the apache software

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,720
foundation

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,280
uh for eight years now uh

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,600
and i was on the board of directors for

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,479
a little while last year

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,280
i'm the vice president of the apache

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,240
petrie

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
project which is an alternative way to

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,400
entering

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,759
uh as an apache project

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,960
to the incubator i'd be one

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,320
if you have a community you can come

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,360
talk to me or talk to the team about

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,399
whether or not your community might

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,479
want to become an apache project i'm the

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,079
mentor right now for

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,119
six different um paddlings

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,960
they're in various stages i'm a

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,640
pmc member of the incubator

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,960
olingo who i mentored

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,600
several years ago also involved with

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,719
apache open office

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,000
apache poi was where

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,000
me and my team started uh contributing

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,840
oh probably 14 years ago

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,360
and i also mentored pulsar and i'm on

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
the pmc

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,840
uh and as a user uh

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,400
started out using tomcat though probably

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,720
18 years ago and everyone's used http

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
d server and i've also been involved

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,040
with some

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,440
adobe experience manager projects uh

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
that are based on slaying jack rabbit

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,560
and felix

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,280
and they've used poi and pdf box and xml

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,840
graphics

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,840
etc to do various manipulations with

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
documents

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,080
so topics for the day first uh

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,200
we'll talk i'll talk about steps to

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,760
follow during and before incubation

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
and then if there's time i will talk

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,159
about

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
how we monitor the clutch

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,040
so there's an incubation life cycle and

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,879
it really starts with your proposal

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,760
and you have some type of initial

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,799
community or an idea

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,040
and then you decide you want to join the

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,920
incubator and you need to

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
go through a process that includes

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,200
writing a proposal

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,159
and other items along those lines

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,000
there's you know

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,400
how to start then there's incubation

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,480
which can go for quite a while and

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,920
there's some important things

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,120
uh to deal with in there

00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:01,840
uh and then there's um graduation

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,840
how to tell when you're ready for that

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,080
so we're going to talk about um

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,840
proposing a project an incubator

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
you know you have your initial community

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,800
you need um a champion a champion

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,479
is um someone

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,479
who will help you uh

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,600
get the proposal together and help you

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,199
find your mentors

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,240
and um help you lead the discussions and

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,919
setups

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
so um your initial community and project

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
you need to think about

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,280
you know your group of people eventually

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,080
you're going to want to be a diverse

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,320
group so if you're starting off with

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,440
people from various different

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,320
vendors that's great

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
or you could be individuals do you have

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,520
software already are you developing a

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
new idea

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,240
uh you know if you have software then

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,000
you're going to need to contribute it

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,000
and you're going to identify what it is

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,560
you know the champion will guide you

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,759
into the incubator

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,440
uh champion may not uh become one of

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
your mentors or may become one of your

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
mentors

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160
and then you need uh mentors uh

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
you need you should have at least three

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
uh

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,880
it's going to become important when we

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,600
talk about releases

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,160
why you should have three mentors and

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,360
you want to find people who are actually

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,840
actively interested in your community

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
if you can

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,520
so you're going to start by

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:55,199
writing a proposal so the incubator wiki

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,400
has um a proposal

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,840
format so it has a discussion here

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,000
about what to do and then you can also

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,600
look at all there's a history of all the

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
other proposals

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,560
so when you get your proposal together

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,240
you're going to

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,280
create you might do this offline in

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,120
in word or some other format but

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:25,120
at some point you're going to put this

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:30,639
into the incubator wiki

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,639
and then you're going to discuss

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,720
with the incubator on in in public

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,800
the uh on the general list the proposal

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
and you'll talk about it you might get a

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
few more mentors there but

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,039
you know people who want to be mentors

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,000
and learn

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,360
but the more you have when you start the

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,440
better off you are

00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:03,840
and it's a fairly lengthy document um

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,840
let's just uh we'll grab one here

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
so you see

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,919
there's a whole thing this is sort of

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
the if you were listening to the

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,360
keynotes this is sort of the why

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
about the project and how and this the

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
list of developers you see this is a

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,039
fairly small project

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,440
um and

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,000
various things happened here and then

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,240
they have the initial committer list and

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,280
they have the champion

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,280
and the list of mentors here

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:51,280
and then the vote happens

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:56,160
uh in the incubator and um

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,560
you know typically when we approve

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
and so then you're ready to start

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,000
incubation

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,599
so there are a few different things

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
and this is just a highlight of some of

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,840
the important items but there are a few

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,759
more items that you need to deal with

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,680
uh while doing that you know

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
but the important thing is establishing

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
the mailing lists

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,759
uh setting up the contributors license

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,080
agreements

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,080
and also transferring repositories uh

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,280
so that you can move ahead with the

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,479
coding

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,719
uh the mailing lists um

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
you know we typically there's the

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
development list and this is

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,839
where development discussions need to be

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
and this is where

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,360
important decisions should be made or

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,200
memorialized

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,800
on the list and this may be where you

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,160
find people introducing themselves

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,320
saying they're interested in the project

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,760
there's a private list and

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,680
that is used for discussions

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,680
um and

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,320
and it generally should only be used for

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,519
like personal matters or problems or

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,360
it's also where uh security discussions

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,640
can occur because if you know if um

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
someone finds a security issue with your

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,640
software

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,800
then um you know it can't be discussed

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,839
in public it needs to be discussed in

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,519
private

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,160
uh there might be also branding issues

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,880
or other private items like that

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
or you know you have you know maybe you

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,440
have a

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,440
um a contributor to your community who's

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
being problematic and you might want to

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
discuss it with

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,120
the management committee

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,240
but generally it should be a quiet list

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,360
um the commits list

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,640
is where typically where

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,360
changes the repository are memorialized

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,360
and and things like that so here's some

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
kind of an example

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,320
of of a project

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
that um i'm not going to show you any

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
private lists obviously but here's the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
development list for the daffodil

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
podling

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
and you can see they have a few things

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
they have someone coming in and making

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,600
first contact

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,720
and they've been uh replied to this

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
morning

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
so that's a good thing they're welcoming

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,320
someone to the project

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
uh the commits list

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
you know has you know github messages

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,279
and

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,839
also various other messages from

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,839
jira in this case

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,519
so that's pretty handy um

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,959
but you need to establish that so um

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,839
that's one of the first things to do

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,480
um and all the community needs to do the

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
um uh if you're already an apache

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
committer then you've already done this

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
but if you haven't then you need to go

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,560
through this process

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,519
and then um you might need to do a

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,279
software

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,920
uh grant agreement or a corporate

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,440
contributor license um

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,680
to uh move the code over

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
this is important the quicker you get

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,160
this done people can get this done

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,480
uh the better of course people may need

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,600
to talk to lawyers or whatever about

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,519
you know to understand what the

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,640
uh cla means and what their

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
responsibilities are

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
and your mentor should be able to help

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
you with that and

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,680
uh your champion or one of your mentors

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
should be

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,639
you know doing emails around this

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,639
process

00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:00,720
uh community setup um

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,760
well typically i think almost every um

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,440
every uh piling right now is is now

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,200
using github

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:14,240
uh what apache git box is is it's a um

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
a mirror uh that exists within

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,839
the uh on apache infrastructure that way

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,040
um you know we have uh in our records

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,079
all of the software which

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,200
is part of the foundation and so it

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,800
moves things over

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,720
and allows people to contribute

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,720
um to the project if they

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,160
do not want to have a github account um

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,279
in the past there was some concern about

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,560
github being around so once you've

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,399
set up your two-factor authentication

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,639
and uh with everything then you should

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,920
hooking your github username to your

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,600
apache account

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,600
and you're all set up and ready to go

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,399
so here we go we're migrating to apache

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,440
during incubation there are several

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,480
important um aspects that you need to

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
you know deal with um

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,040
and they're pretty much they can come in

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,600
pretty much four categories

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,480
uh you need to build your community and

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,639
you need to

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,760
make it more diverse and by diversity we

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,120
mean from

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,560
diverse from different people in

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,320
different communities

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,360
so that should any one

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,360
set of people disappear you

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,440
for whatever reason you have enough

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,880
people to continue

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,760
for now you know if the community

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,240
doesn't build

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,120
then perhaps you know you'll retire and

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,160
move the

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
content elsewhere you know it's a

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,279
natural process

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
you know communities have a life cycle

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,560
projects have a life cycle

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,959
um so it can be that no one's like

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
no one's interested in the software

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
anymore

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,079
in the project and then you know things

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,680
move on

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,519
that also happens to existing projects

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
and communities that are top level

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,240
projects which is what you

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,560
are trying to graduate to do you learn

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,720
how to make proper apache releases

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,000
that follow the release policy

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,800
and um are

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,800
really set up and properly set up and

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,160
then there's a suitable name process

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,279
and there's a website so

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,720
here are some pointers um and

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,120
you know we hear a lot about a community

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,040
we heard a lot about community and

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
the keynotes which is i think a really

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,000
helpful

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
uh point um you know you want to welcome

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,920
people

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,639
you want them you know you want to

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,360
make people who write good code into

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
committers

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,560
as quickly as possible you want to

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,199
recognize

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,959
non-code contributions because you

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
really need all that support you need

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,279
people that are willing to talk to users

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,240
and help them triage their questions

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,600
people that can write documentation uh

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,279
people that can

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
understand the legality of the code

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,839
without necessarily having to write it

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
all

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,560
so these are really important again i

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,600
want to reiterate you want to make your

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,199
decisions

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,880
or memorialize them on the mailing list

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,560
although there are plenty other ways of

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,519
talking with your community and talking

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
about development

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,880
people are using slack there are ways

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,920
of copying your slack

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,040
digest to your mailing list just to have

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,480
the record

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,160
um you know and you know of course we

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
want to be respectful and nice and we

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,920
want to remember

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
one of this is a really important point

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
is that we want asynchronous

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,880
communications

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,320
and that that way we can let the world

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,199
revolve

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839
and people can get their opinions in so

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,199
you know

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,480
please you know limit your

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,360
uh emails and to you know one or two

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
on a thread before until you know you

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,639
give people

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,279
a chance to respond and people can be

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
part of the

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,120
answer uh another thing i've seen is

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,000
i've seen people

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,440
in one paddling eye mentor they every

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,120
couple weeks they

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,279
ask the question what are people working

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,600
on and then people can bring that up

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,160
and uh there could be discussion if

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,160
necessary

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,480
then making apache releases is

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,279
is key and there's here's some resources

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
here on the

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,839
um for how to do that other people will

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
be talking about this i'm not going to

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,160
go

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
too deeply in this but you know you

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,040
notice that

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
what's important is the release

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,880
candidate is voted on for at least 72

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,039
hours

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,240
and then um the in the because

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,280
releases are done at apache by a project

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,720
management committee

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,160
and they're the ones who are legally

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,720
approving things and that

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,360
has to do with our non-profit status etc

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
that

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,959
and corporate status that we set up that

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,280
we have

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,720
uh that be enacted the foundation

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,320
through the pmc

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,440
so the ipmc uh has to

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,160
approve a very paddling release

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,160
if you have three mentors voting on your

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,520
three or more voting on your dead list

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,360
then

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,160
those votes can carry over and you're

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,120
just letting people know

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,200
and someone ipmc may be willing to

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,640
review it in addition they might find

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,039
some things that can be improved anyway

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,000
that's essentially what you're doing

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,000
here

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,520
so um it's also

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,840
important that uh the brand name

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:18,080
be unique and doesn't it won't confuse

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,440
with other entities

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,640
software that might be similarly named

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,960
so you need to

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
also watch out for people misusing your

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,679
name

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,559
uh this can be you know typical

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,120
uh issues like you know so there might

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,840
be

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,360
you know a really hot project like say

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,640
cassandra

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,640
and several vendors have their own

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,760
version of cassandra

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,200
uh but it can't be you know

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,640
um vendor cassandra it has to be

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:59,600
named in a particular way where it's um

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:03,280
you know uh uh vendors do hickey

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,960
powered by cassandra or

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,200
you know depending on the relationship

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,880
it might be for cassandra

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,720
so that's just an example um

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,720
so you know the better a pmc

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,320
project manager committee is about

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,840
managing their brand

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,960
uh the better uh things will be if

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,480
uh if they are successful um and there's

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,520
an approval process

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
and that gets marked

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,360
uh there's a paddling website

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,520
um you know there's some rules about the

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,799
download page

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,840
project logo i want to tell people how

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,760
to communicate with you

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,160
etc and there's a few different places

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,480
where

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,880
there's analysis about that

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,160
uh about whether you have the proper

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,360
links etc that we are looking for

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,799
okay so you've done all those things and

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,679
you know you're doing really well

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,080
and you've got a community and it is

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,240
just

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,360
flying so you want to graduate

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,840
it's time you've got a diverse community

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,360
there's a maturity model you know who

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,039
the pmc is

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,960
and you're ready to graduate so um

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,919
you know have you had community growth

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,320
are decisions made in the open

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
et cetera the maturity model is

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,919
something developed by the

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,760
community development project and

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:43,280
this is one way of measuring things

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,840
it's not the only way um

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,080
but it is something that mentors

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,480
recommend

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,200
um you have a discussion and you vote so

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,960
just like you had a discussion about

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,720
joining the incubator you have a

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,000
discussion about graduation i want the

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,440
impc will then

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,480
affirmatively vote um

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,640
for your graduation and then the board

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:16,320
at the monthly meeting has to approve

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,280
your resolution and uh

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,320
and then by act of the foundation uh

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,520
they make you a top level project

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,039
so congratulations you're

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:34,080
now uh part fully part of the apache

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,080
community so um

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,679
so that this is interesting so basically

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,039
i've got a few

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:45,039
more things i can talk about in terms

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:49,360
of um some of the things that

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:52,480
are done um we have

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,360
a file and it's a version

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,080
that basically is an index of every

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,000
project

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,880
every paddling that's been through uh

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
through incubation or is in incubation

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,080
and

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,960
uh it's called paddlings.xml a lot of

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,360
the information is maintained

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,440
via something we call whimsy but

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,039
when you create a project you've got to

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,240
enter the

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:24,720
section of xml for the project

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,720
in here along with the initial

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,919
champion and um and a bracket for the

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,720
mentors

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,919
um and then you can finish the mentors

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,240
and whimsy

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,240
um

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,840
and then also there are two other files

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
that get created

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
there's something that's new and not

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,960
fully

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,559
this only it's here and these these

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,400
things appear

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,799
in um whimsy uh this is some

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
a process that started a few years back

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,840
and is not

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,000
um uh

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
not totally complete there's more work

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
to be done but

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,200
you know we're volunteers so it you know

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,840
no one has finished this

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,280
task but this shows some of the

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
information

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,840
but the main file and this is an even

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,840
older format

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:34,000
is the status file so

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
you you work from a template and this

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
provides information

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,840
about

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,440
the status it's also sort of uh still a

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,320
checklist

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
for the mentors

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,279
and we have a there's a big python

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
program

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,360
that um is over 10 years old that

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,559
i did significant updating on it

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,760
so that it for example finds all the get

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,679
hub uh git based projects

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,320
as opposed to everything at the time

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,480
this was written everything was in svn

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:23,600
uh so that is important

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:28,559
and we do this clutch analysis

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:32,320
on a daily basis and

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,960
it's run through

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,019
um

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,019
[Music]

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:46,080
it's run through the ci builds

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,240
builds so there's two parts there's a

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,880
clutch analysis

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,919
um from svn and then

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,840
there's the get site build

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,120
which puts you put the information

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,760
together

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:08,320
and so

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,320
that clutch analysis builds this report

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,799
which talks about a whole bunch of

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,880
different things

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,799
with the with each of the of the

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,400
paddlings

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,400
and there's a whole description of them

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,559
just things we're watching out for for

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
completion

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,679
there's a list of all the current

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,039
mentors of

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,000
podlings so if you're

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:42,559
looking for mentors this might be a

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
place to look

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,960
and then there's some other

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
documentation here

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,840
the website is

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,840
in github

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,840
there's a whole set of information about

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,880
this so

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,400
um anyone wants to help contribute

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,679
that would be great for example

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,159
um one thing that could be

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,159
fixed

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,400
for each of these problems so let's just

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,400
do this really quick here

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,159
so there's a report for each podling and

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
it

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,679
has references it you know

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,679
talks about you know when um

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,279
you know the various repositories were

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,559
last touched

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,080
um also information about downloads and

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,520
it's in the proper

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,039
urls that we like to see for

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,480
for those things signature checking

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,559
hash um what

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
um and then there's some information

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,120
about things that could be better on the

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
website for example

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,440
um

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,039
one of the things that we need to update

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,240
the clutch

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,840
python program to do is instead of using

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,200
the mail archives

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,760
which are older we're now more using

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,240
these

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,799
this list.apache.org so switching over

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,799
to this

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,919
is a little bit of work because there's

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,600
a

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,039
and there's an index of things anyway

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,240
there's i looked at it again this

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,600
morning there's a little bit of work

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,000
there

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,000
um

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,120
we've got a release management guideline

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,840
there's some extra stuff

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,840
that um

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,480
the incubator allow requires uh

00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:01,360
we have a choice of disclaimers

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,480
uh so that um you know if you're

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,279
not fully compliant but you can disclaim

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,480
what the

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,559
what the what the known issues are

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,080
with your releases

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,640
so that you can continue um to release

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,960
as you

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,279
migrate your project fully to be apache

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,880
compliant etc

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,120
um i guess

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,840
what i'd like to do now uh if there's

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,840
anyone who would like to ask any

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
questions

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,799
you can put them in the chat

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,840
if you'd like

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:13,840
okay well um thank you very much

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:13,840
