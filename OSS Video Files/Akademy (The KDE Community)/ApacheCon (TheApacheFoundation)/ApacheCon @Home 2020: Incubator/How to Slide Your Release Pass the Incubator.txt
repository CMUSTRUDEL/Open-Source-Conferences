Description: 
	How to Slide Your Release Pass the Incubator
Justin Mclean

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

All podling releases need to be voted on by the incubator PMC before being released to the world. I'll go through what the incubator PMC looks for in every release and what you can do to make it pass that IPMC vote and get your project one step closer to graduation. More importantly I'll cover where you can get help if you need it. In this talk, I'll describe current incubator and ASF policy, recent changes that you may not be aware of, and go into detail the legal requirements of common open source licenses and the best way to assemble your NOTICE and LICENSE files. Where possible I describe the reasons behind why things are done a certain which may not always be obvious from our documentation. I'll show how I review a release and the simple tools I use. I'll go through a worked example or two, including a fictional project called Apache Wombat, and cover common mistakes I've seen in releases.

i'm going to get started could someone

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,439
just give me a thumbs up whether they

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
can hear me and see my

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,120
slides so you can

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,680
i know that i'm just not talking to

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,680
myself here

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,719
so thanks nick

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,760
so my talk today is on

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,360
how to slide your release past the

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,559
incubator

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,840
and let me

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,840
uh sorry just need one sec here

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,119
yeah that'll that'll work better if i do

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
that

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,600
so first off just a little bit about who

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,200
i am um

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
my name's justin mclean i've been with

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,159
apache for a number of years now

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,960
uh i'm currently one of the nine board

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,960
members

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
and i'm also currently the vp of the

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,240
apache incubator

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,360
so i'm make sure that all

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,119
sorry i make sure that all the podlings

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,520
submit their reports on time and

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,159
that the board gets a a a nice report

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
and i'm also

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
responsible for reviewing that report as

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
well

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
so i sort of wear two hats there i'm

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
also a freelance developer and educator

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,000
um i'm also involved in the incubator

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,799
pmc

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
being the vp and i'm involved in a few

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
other

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,960
pmcs as well and i also mentor

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,880
several projects and i have reviewed

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,840
hundreds of releases probably

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,440
of the order of about 500 i think at

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
this point um i did have an accurate

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,000
count at one time but i sort of lost

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,319
that after i got past the 350 mark a

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,599
couple years back

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,360
so uh so i generally

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,520
you know know know how to review a

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
release and what goes into it and

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
what you need to look out for and i know

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,000
some of the common issues that

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
you can run into

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,480
so first off here we do have a lot of

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
people who seem that this is their first

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
apache con

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,680
and they may be new to apache so they

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
may not know what the apache incubator

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
is

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
so the apache incubator is the main

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
entry point for new projects

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,560
it's not the only one but it is

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
certainly the main one

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,599
and it's where communities come to

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
apache and they learn how to be an

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,480
apache project

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,959
and they grow their

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
project around them and hopefully

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,879
graduate from

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,680
from the incubator that usually takes a

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,519
a a couple of years

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
so just a little more detail on that

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,000
process there

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,879
so we have an incubating process so that

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
we

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,200
projects there's a few things there's

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,239
some startup things that we we

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,319
need to do and that includes making sure

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,599
that everything complies with the apache

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,120
license

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,400
um but we also want to make sure that

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,480
the the podling follows some isf values

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
it's often referred to as the apache way

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
um

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
and i'll speak a little bit about that

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
in

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
in a minute but it means that they they

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,799
follow the typical structure

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,440
of projects that they have contributors

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
who commit to the project uh committers

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
who have the commitment and can actually

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,840
have access to the repo

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,720
and a pmc where in the case of a

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,280
puddling or incubating project it's

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,319
called a ppmc

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
so we also need to know that the

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,720
projects

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,000
grant more responsibility uh via

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,599
macro accessory and

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
that everything is done in the open so

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,040
this means open communication on the

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,440
mailing list

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,799
it means that everything is transparent

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,840
and

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,120
um and in particular that people act

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
as individuals and not the company they

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
work for and and this is

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
maybe one of the biggest problems that

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,360
i've seen some recent projects have some

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
some issues with

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
so basically we want we want the project

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,160
to be able to learn how to follow this

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
apache way so what is this apache way

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
that i've been talking about

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
well there's sort of a number of

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
versions of it and it takes a while

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,160
to sort of understand all of it but i've

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,199
sort of got some of the main points here

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,639
the first off apache software foundation

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,000
is a charity and we make software

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,800
for the public good so and that software

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,759
is given away freely

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
we're also pragmatic our business our

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,960
license is business friendly

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
and it means that

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,800
you can take something that's apache

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
license and and use it but you don't

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
have to contribute back to the project

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
if you don't want to unlike some other

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,479
licenses

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,080
we think that in the long term that

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,360
gives

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,759
more opportunity for

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,160
for people to contribute some of them

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,840
won't contribute but that's that's okay

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,199
but in the long term it means that more

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,680
will you're also about the community

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,000
behind the project

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
and that is means important things such

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,280
as collaboration consensus and

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,639
diversity and

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
you might have heard that we have a

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,440
saying that it's called

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
community over code there's also this

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,919
concept of merit that

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,479
that the more you do the more

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,319
responsibility you have and the project

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,039
needs to recognize merit by

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,160
voting you in as a committer or as a pmc

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,120
member

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,080
and it's not just code contributions

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
that that

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,160
gain merit you

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
also need to

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
recognize people who contribute to

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,360
testing and documentation

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,759
and speak at conferences and help users

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
and you know all those sort of things as

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
well

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
one of the really important things is

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,160
that everything is open

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
and in the public view and that

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,280
discussions occur on the mailing list

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,600
this means that everyone can participate

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
so

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
it means that the the people who are not

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
in your time zone

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
can can join in it means the people who

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,199
only work part-time on the project

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
can can join in it means that the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
hobbyists

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,880
can join in so and that's a

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,800
really important concept and also

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,880
that we work via consensus and that

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
means finding a way that everyone can

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,919
work together

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,919
to move forward even though there might

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,919
be sometimes be some some disagreements

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,560
so the current state of play for the

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,240
apache incubator is that we've got

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,720
48 projects in the incubator

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,280
it's remain relatively stable over the

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
over the

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
last couple years that it was a little

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
higher a few years back

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,800
um but i think at that point in time uh

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
the incubator

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
probably had a few too many projects and

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,880
and not enough mentors to be able to

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,000
to handle all that work

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
there are 306 incubator pmc members but

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,960
not all of these are active

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
and it usually takes around two years in

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
the incubator but some projects stay

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,440
longer they've got a couple in the three

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
or four year mark at the moment

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
and i think the longest a project's been

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,319
in the incubator is about

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,759
seven years so we have about a dozen

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,759
releases a month

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
and one thing that has improved in

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
recent years is that the number of

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
releases that pass the incubator vote

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,919
and i'll talk about this in a minute

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,160
also and we've got around about the

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,160
90 mark which which is good to see

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,479
so the whole point of of making a

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,759
release is that it has to follow some

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,599
some apache policies and also some

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
values as well that we we have

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,440
and there's a few simple things that you

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
that it must have it must be as

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
contains source code and doesn't have

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,639
any compiled code in there

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,120
it needs to be cryptographically signed

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
in a particular way

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
and mostly these days scripts can do

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,719
that all automatically for you so that's

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,120
that's not a big deal

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,560
um it must have an incubating disclaimer

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
uh and there's two of those

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,320
uh that it used to be that there was

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,399
just you had just had to say that this

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
was an incubating project

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,200
that we've now introduced a second

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,640
disclaimer which makes it a little

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,560
easier to make releases in some cases

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,320
it also has to have a the apache license

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
file and a no

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,360
notice file and these must follow the

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,920
apache policy

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
if you bundle any third-party code in

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,320
your software

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
you also need to follow their license

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
terms as well

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
and also follow apache policy on that

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
and that generally just means mentioning

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
the license

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,040
in your license file and maybe putting

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
something in notice

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,839
as well

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
and any of the license that you do

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
include

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,399
they need to be compatible with the

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
apache license so they can't add any

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
restrictions

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
on top of it and all the source files

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
need to have those have

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
headers of the files that you've created

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
in the projector so it's not not

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
third-party files so they're they're

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,640
basically everything that needs to be

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,640
done to to make a valid source release

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,480
so i'll just mention that work in

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
progress disclaimer

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,640
and we were having some problems in the

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,640
incubator where

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,760
some projects were taking a long time to

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,240
to be able to

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
get releases that complete complied with

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
policy

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
and they'll often have to many revisions

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,079
of release candidates

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
so

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,279
in order to fix this up what we've done

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,399
is we've introduced a work in progress

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,079
disclaimer

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,720
where you can list some of the things

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,600
that may be wrong with the release

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,279
that may not comply with asf policy um

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
and and that's all fine as long as

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,440
people are aware of these issues

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
um the whole point of the incubating

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
project is that

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
it it you know it's learning this

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
process and it may not get things right

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,120
the first time

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
or the second time uh and so the idea is

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,519
that you list the issues that are in

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
this disclaimer

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,720
and these issues need to be fixed before

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,399
you can graduate so at the point of

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,839
graduation you'll you'll have a release

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,560
that complies with

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
uh all of asf policy and and the apache

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
license

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
so the way that releases are made is you

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
first make a release and

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
then we'll release candidates i should

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
say

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
to the next slide a release candidate

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
and then on your dev mailing list you

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,920
you vote on that release

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,000
and to for it to be a release you only

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,079
need three plus one votes

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
and more plus ones than minus one so a

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,040
minus one is not a veto

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399
so someone can't say that we shouldn't

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
release this because of this little

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,160
trivial issue here

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
um that being said minus one vote should

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,160
be taken seriously

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,760
and considered and it may be the fact

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,120
that the release manager decides that a

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,959
new release candidate

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,120
is is needed so if the if the vote fails

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
or if the red lease manager decides that

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
a new

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
candidate is needed then you know

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
obviously those issues are fixed and

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
new candidates get then you do the vote

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,560
again so once the vote actually

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,600
passes then you vote on the incubator

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,800
general mailing list uh and again you

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
need

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
three plus one votes and more plus ones

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
than minus ones

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
um and that same things goes now

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,320
generally

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,000
these votes last 72 hours but that is

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,360
actually just a guideline

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
and and that's an interesting thing

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,240
about apache is that most of these

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,760
things that you think of as policies are

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
really guidelines

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
they're they're ways that this is a good

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,519
way

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,839
that we've found for things to work but

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,880
they may not apply to all projects

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,320
and and certainly since becoming my

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,839
involvement in patchy and more in recent

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,399
times because my involvement and board

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,880
and

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,880
reviewing a lot of projects reports it's

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,639
made me realize that there are actually

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,160
a lot of variations in between different

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,959
projects and not all

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,360
projects do things the same way

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,959
so why might you get a minus one vote on

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,519
on your release

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,000
um and there's a few common issues

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,079
generally

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
things like unexpected binaries in a

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,760
source release you know we are making

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,040
open source software so

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
you shouldn't have compiled code in

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,680
there um

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
we have some categories of licenses that

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,920
split up into category a

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,959
category b and category x and i'll talk

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,079
a little bit about them

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,360
a little later and

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
so if you include something from

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,160
category x then that's

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,680
has something that is not compatible

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
with the apache license

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
and so that's usually something like the

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,399
gpl license so that you can't make a

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,320
release like that

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,120
you also can't depend on anything that's

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,120
in category x

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,639
so the source release also can't include

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
anything from category b

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,920
um so they're probably the most common

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,839
issues and then you get

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,399
some other issues that are not so common

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,800
um

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,560
having issues with licenses will notice

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,199
they're probably reasonably common

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,959
and down to copyright issues or you know

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,480
you don't have permission to distribute

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
some files that you've included in the

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,680
release and then you get to some minor

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,959
issues

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,000
like missing license headers or you know

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,000
things along those lines

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,160
so and and the whole point of this is

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,079
that it doesn't have to be perfect you

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,760
you want to make each release better

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,360
than the previous one

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
so it's not essential that you get it

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,880
right the first time

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,800
um and as i said before when you're

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
starting out you may not be aware of

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,320
everything that you need to do and you

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,399
may not be familiar with the policy

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,720
and our current policy and guidelines

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
don't cover all situations

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,279
uh in recent years this there's actually

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,399
been a bit of a gap i think between

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,320
uh the way policy has gone forward and

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,680
what projects are actually doing because

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,720
now we have

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,760
lots more ways of distributing software

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,959
on many many third-party platforms uh

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,120
you know like docker for instance uh

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,800
and our policy hasn't really kept up to

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,079
pace and can address that we're trying

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,199
to do some things about that at the

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,360
moment

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,959
and hopefully you'll see some action on

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
that

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,880
you know soon um and as i mentioned

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
before you know different projects do

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
things in different ways

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
uh and all of these are good and can

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,519
comply with with

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
you know the values that apache holds

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,800
so what you want to aim for is something

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
that doesn't have any surprises in it

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,360
and that a user

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,839
wouldn't see they go oh i didn't think

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
that was

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
the case so

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,079
so and as i was just saying that there's

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
not one right like answer that

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,519
there's our documentations can sometimes

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,480
be a little confusing and sometimes a

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,079
little out of date

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,680
and sometimes our cultural knowledge

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
isn't well documented

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,880
so there's some things that are common

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,000
practice that are just

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,279
maybe not written down um

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
one of the other issues that the

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,759
incubator does have is that there's

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
quite a large group of

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,360
incubator pmc members and there's quite

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,880
a lot of differing operation

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
opinions there on what's correct and

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
what is not correct and

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,480
what would is the best way to follow

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
policy and depending on the project

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,360
there's often

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,800
multiple ways that you can come up with

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,920
to comply with it and often

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,759
they take very very different forms so

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,600
my advice here is just

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:07,279
you know try and

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
err on the side of caution and

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
look just at previous releases and see

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,560
what they have done

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,240
um hopefully more recent ones than the

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,959
ones going back

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,320
because that can certainly help so some

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
of the common problems that you'll run

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
into

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,279
uh licensing is is definitely one of

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,759
them where

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,440
um some issues can occur and then

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,839
sometimes it's poorly understood about

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,639
what's

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,160
required um and you know mostly

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
developers just want to write code they

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
don't want to

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,480
deal with legal stuff i can totally

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,079
understand that

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
um the language used in licensing is

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,199
quite complex and can be a

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,519
barrier to people whose whose

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,199
native timeline is english let alone

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,040
people who don't speak english as their

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,519
first language

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,839
uh and also asf policy has changed over

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,040
time so occasionally you'll run into

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,040
into projects that may have been

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,320
following policy but

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
are now not because something

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,920
something's changed

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,400
and sometimes those changes are gradual

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,640
and sometimes they happen quite suddenly

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,240
so you you need to keep on top of it and

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
be aware of what's what's going on

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,360
on top of the licensing um which you

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,880
know

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,640
gives you certain the certain legal

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,679
obligations that you need to comply with

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
there

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,400
uh apache policy adds another layer on

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,640
top of that and there's a few new things

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
so for example we need to have a license

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,480
for a notice file

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,520
and we need to list all licenses in the

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,760
license file

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,840
now an a project that's not an isf

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
project can also use the apache license

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,600
but they don't need to comply with asf

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,440
policy so they don't need to do

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,280
any of those two things um and we also

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,120
at apache have a bit more respect for

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,120
third-party licenses and headers

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,720
and we'll definitely make sure that the

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,960
headers stay attached

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,840
to the files and are not changed without

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
the owner's permission

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
so when you're assembling the license

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,000
and notice file there's

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
there's a thing called a guiding

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,480
principle

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,440
and this guiding principle is that

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,640
basically you want it to contain

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
anything that's referenced in the

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,039
license and notice there is what's

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,440
actually in the distribution

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,960
so it's not something that's a

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,240
dependency that's

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,000
that's not included in the distribution

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,520
so you only need to mention stuff that's

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
actually included in the release and not

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,799
stuff that's not in the release

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
and this applies to both source and

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,960
binary artifacts and this

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
has an implication in that the license

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,320
and notice file

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,880
of the source and binaries may differ

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,559
because of that

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000
so what else do you need to look out for

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,160
when you're

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,520
going through creating these files

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,480
and making a release well often you'll

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
you'll get

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
you'll be bundled some some third-party

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,440
product in with your

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,799
release what software um and it's always

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,320
good to check to see what it

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,320
contains just because it says on the

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
label that it's mit licensed

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,280
doesn't mean that everything inside it

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,600
might be mit licensed

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,360
you might find some hidden surprises in

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,039
there that you weren't expecting and

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,480
worst case you may actually find that

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,200
you know there's something that's

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
category x such as under a gpl license

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
hidden inside it

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,640
or you might find that it has something

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
that is actually not under an open

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
source license at all

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,919
and you wouldn't have permission to

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,520
distribute

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:37,280
and this often comes up with photos

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,799
and and other resources like fonts

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,559
and the licensing around fonts in

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,840
particular is quite complex and you need

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,480
to be very careful

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,600
on there um one other thing a good thing

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,320
to do is have a look at

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,240
if there's any links in the code that

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,640
points to where the code came from

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,640
you can go have a look at those and see

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,559
how that code is licensed

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,720
uh now this may depend on how complex

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,160
your your

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,559
the release artifact is that you're

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,840
creating in some cases this is quite a

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,080
trivial

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,919
exercise and you know it's it's quite

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,320
simple just to go

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,840
through it and and there's not much to

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,720
be done in other cases it can be quite

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,000
complex to

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,520
to do so we do have some tools that

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,400
do help you put these together

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
there's a project called

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,440
rat which is an apache project and it

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
will basically you can run rat over your

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
release

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,000
and it will find things such as binaries

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,960
and it'll look at all the licenses

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
in there it's not perfect uh like any

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,400
tool

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,760
it has a few rough edges uh but it is

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
certainly very useful

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,039
and will save you a lot of work there's

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,280
a few things that it won't

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:51,039
pick up it won't for example find

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,720
double headers and stuff um and it won't

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,919
also check for multiple licenses in the

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,760
same file so you really

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,039
have to find those two things by hand

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,720
and that's um

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,600
i wouldn't say reasonably common but it

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,200
does come up from from time to time

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
it also doesn't know about all software

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,039
licenses

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
um and one thing that has a feature in

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,919
it that you

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,600
can make an exclusion list

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,559
and so you can tell it to ignore a whole

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,120
lot of things and a common issue

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,159
with releases is that people make these

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,520
exclusion lists

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,720
too wide um and it actually

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,799
means that it doesn't check something

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,159
that it should check

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,480
and do it i i when i'm

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
checking releases i just rely on a few

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
simple tools i always run

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,000
rat over it but i also have a couple of

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
little scripts that i use which are just

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,559
basically

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,640
um glorified grips and just look for

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,400
common patterns in things

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
so for example if i search for the word

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,280
gpl you know if

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,799
something's or general public um it's

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,320
if it finds something there then there's

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,720
the chance that it's got

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,240
maybe some gpl license software in there

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,360
and you know you need to have a look at

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
that

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,200
uh you can also just do it like a search

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,039
for the word copyright

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
pipe it to sort minus you so you get all

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,960
the unique

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,640
occurrences of that uh and then you can

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
have a look through that and see what

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,320
that that's picked up

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,919
and this is also a nice way to compare

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,120
between releases

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,720
because you can do that on two

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,559
consecutive releases and then compare

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
the do the diffs of the files

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,039
and if they haven't changed then you

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
know the license and notice file

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,919
wouldn't need to have changed

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,760
but there are differences but the

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,840
license files are still the same

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,600
then yeah maybe there's something that

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,440
needs to be looked at there

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,200
so this can just give you a little bit

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,760
of a sanity check

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,080
in working out whether you may have

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,159
missed something

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,440
i was speaking about uh photos before

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,559
and um

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
yeah photos can be problematic um i've

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,880
actually

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,320
had to vote minus one four times

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,960
because of cat photos in a release

00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:01,280
um it's unfortunate but it has happened

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,120
so one good way of just double checking

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,720
this is just find all your images there

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,919
might be other things other than jpegs

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
in there but you can

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,440
you know just do a fine exact copy them

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,799
all to a directory and then

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
you know have a look at all the images

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,520
visually and see if there's anything

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
there that looks like

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
a stock image what looks like a

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,280
professional image um

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,679
and you know you need to make sure that

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,600
you've got the rights

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,799
and that it's under an appropriate

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,520
license and that you can actually

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,520
distribute it

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,640
and if you do find something that looks

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,520
a little suspect you can generally

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,720
quite easily quickly find it it'll often

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
have metadata in the

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,720
in the image itself uh which may

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
describe the license

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,919
uh or you can try and find the original

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
license by using a

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,240
reverse image search in google and that

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,039
will generally point you to the original

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,159
image sometimes

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,520
they're quite hard to track down um but

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,799
you know if there's some doubt then it's

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
probably better just to replace it with

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,640
an image that you

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,640
you've made yourself

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,600
so

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
all releases must contain the license

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,559
file um and this file needs to be called

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,240
license or license.text and it needs to

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,080
exist in the root directory

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,279
and the license file will contain the

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,559
apache license

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,480
and then a list of all the licenses of

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,760
other bundled software that's in that

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,760
release candidate or in that

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,320
distribution um

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,600
so if some of the the text to these

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,919
licenses can be quite

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,279
long so what's preferred is that you

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,200
just put a link

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,360
there and that's not a hyperlink like a

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,520
url but it's a

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,039
link uh generally what you do is you'd

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,880
make a directory called licenses and

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,320
then you put all the licenses in there

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
and then in the license file you'd

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,480
mentioned you know for more information

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,760
save this file

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,559
um and as i mentioned before because

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,159
binaries may have different things

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,159
embedded inside them

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,919
then it's quite likely that the license

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,960
and file will need to be different for

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,559
both the source and

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,600
and the binaries file along with the

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,919
license file you

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,400
also need a notice file and

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,919
this will contain a little copyright at

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,480
the top from from the asf

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,919
well and notice it says it was developed

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,120
at the isf

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,440
um and this needs to be pretty minimal

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,760
and

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,000
only needs to contain what's what's

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,640
legally required

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,559
because it's it affects downstream

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,840
projects so anyone that uses

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,840
your project uh

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,200
will they will need to look at this

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,000
notice file and include some of the

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
contents in there

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,840
so there's only a few things that need

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,159
to go in there and they are what's

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,480
called

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,080
relocated copyright notices so this is

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
if you've had permission to remove a

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,480
copyright notice

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,720
from some of the files in in

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,880
your release um you should mention that

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,679
in the notice file there

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,120
if you've also bundled any other apache

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,520
license software and

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,520
that contains a notice file then you

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,080
need to look at that notice file

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,720
and put some of the contents of that

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,880
notice file into your notice file

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,880
um and there's a couple of other

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,480
required notices but they're pretty rare

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,080
um and you generally don't need to to

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,600
worry about them uh

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
one common problem is that people tend

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
to put licensing information in the

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,279
notice file and that it shouldn't exist

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,600
in the

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,880
notice file that should actually exist

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,159
in the license file

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,000
instead so i mentioned the license

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,159
categories before and there are three

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,960
main categories here

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,679
there is the first category is category

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,480
a and that's

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,400
basically any license that is compatible

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,120
with the apache license

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,320
and so any anything that's in this

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,640
category you can

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
bundle into your release and you can

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,400
also depend on it

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,880
and there's a whole lot of common

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,400
licenses here

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,600
the apache 2.0 license obviously

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,159
the apache 1.1 license

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,840
there's most bsd licenses the except the

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,400
ones with the advertising clause

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,799
mit and a few other common ones there

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,080
that

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,360
you you may be familiar with

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,480
the second category is category b

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,039
and these have some form of restriction

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,919
on them

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,520
and restriction may be minor but

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,679
generally means that they can't be

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,240
included in a source release

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,520
but you are allowed to include them in a

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,679
binary release

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,559
if they're in a binary form because

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
generally the

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,360
the restriction is around modifications

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,159
of code so if you include it in a binary

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,480
form there's

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,840
there's basically no chance that you can

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,159
modify the code

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,480
uh and therefore those those clauses in

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,000
that licenses won't apply

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,919
and there's there's two common ones that

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,200
you'll run into um

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,080
uh well three maybe and that's the

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
cddl license and the eclipse license epl

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,360
license

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,960
uh mozilla public license as well that's

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
probably less common these days

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,279
and also most creative common licenses

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,279
and this is probably the most common one

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,720
uh that you you run into there there's

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,720
you've got to be very careful with the

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,480
creative commons licenses and including

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,919
content that is licensed

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,320
under creative commons in an apache

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,240
product if it's something like an image

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,159
uh then that's generally fine and and

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,399
that's because it's in binary form and

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,840
it would have to be include it in the

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,240
binary release but not in the source

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,240
release

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,000
and the final category is category x

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,960
which you can't include

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,480
in a release and you can't depend on and

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
there's a few exceptions

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,480
of things like build tool and there's

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
also an exception that

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,279
if it's something that you that's a

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,880
dependency but not everyone needs it so

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,559
it's an optional thing

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,720
as long as you're very clear about

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,120
that this is optional and the license

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,559
isn't compatible then that's okay

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,640
so gpl is the is the most common one

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,720
there um and i think also the the

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,520
strangely if the apache 1.0 license

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
probably falls

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,200
into category x but i've never run into

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,399
an instance where we've we've had to

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,399
to double check that

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,760
so there's a few things that you know

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,159
you look for when you're creating a

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,279
release uh the first one would be

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,159
no unexpected binary files in the

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,240
release so

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,760
again we're making open source software

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,919
and so that's got to be

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,919
source code you can't have compiled code

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,720
in a source release so that means no

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,679
executables no dlls no jars

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,399
or class files um it also means no

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,360
minified

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,440
js without the source as well because

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,640
while it's not compiled

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,799
um it it's not the source code so again

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,159
you know the whole point about making

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,360
open source software is that you have

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,000
all the code there that

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,760
you can do and well you can sort of

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,760
unminify js is pretty ugly

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,720
so the other thing is that uh headers so

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,440
that you know all apache license source

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,679
files have to have an isf header

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,520
and there are actually two different asf

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,360
headers there's one for

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,960
software developed at the apache

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,679
software foundation

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,039
and there's another one for third

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,200
parties to use

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,200
so you've got to use the use the correct

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,000
one

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,399
and the last thing that you have to do

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,960
when you're making a release is that

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,559
that can actually be compiled from code

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
so

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,919
someone can come along and easily

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
compile it and so

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,960
it needs to have some instructions on

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,480
how to do this and this is usually you

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,760
know the readme or something along those

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,720
lines

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,320
um and you know it's always good to give

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,440
a bit more information than that as well

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,080
as you know if it doesn't work on a

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,600
platform

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,039
please note that if there's some

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,799
dependencies that you're required to

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,840
install beforehand

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,279
then note that um so you want to make it

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,679
easy for someone to follow

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,600
and and to be able to do this and

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,320
sometimes this can be the most difficult

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,440
part

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,320
in making releases so that they are

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,279
actually easy for a user to compile and

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,279
make the software with

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
so i'll just go over some of those

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,320
common mistakes again so the you know

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,600
the

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,640
the um having unexpected binary files i

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,480
compile code

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,000
in in a source release is certainly

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,600
something to look out for

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,760
um getting the contents of license and

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,760
notice can can be hard

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,320
and it may take a few iterations with

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,080
the new disclaimer

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,240
that makes it a lot easier because you

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,880
can just list that as one of the issues

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,399
in the

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,919
in the work in progress disclaimer and

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,559
said well the license

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
may not quite be up to date yet and if

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,480
you do know what the issues are you can

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,120
also list them as well

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,760
so um the binary and source

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,799
files may not have the same license and

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,360
notice file

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,360
so if they if they've got extra bits put

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,480
in inside the binary that's very likely

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
that the license is going to be

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,679
different

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
uh missing heading headers is a common

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,200
one or in some cases replacing

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,799
third-party headings headers

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,320
or in some places putting asf headers on

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,799
top of third-party code

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,480
they're all common situations that you

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,760
can

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,120
run into i've talked about the rat

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,000
exclusions and how they sometimes

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,559
sometimes miss

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,919
issues one other issue that's been more

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,519
on the rise recently is

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,720
a lot of projects are automating this

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,320
process to make their releases and

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,720
that's a great thing

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,480
but in doing all that automation they

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,360
often don't do a lot of manual checking

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,640
and there's some

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,039
subtle mistakes that can creep in there

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,720
and the

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,880
the automation may not actually find

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,679
everything that you expect it does

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,120
um so do be careful if you if you're

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,840
using automation

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,360
there i'm missing a disclaimer all

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,880
incubating releases need to have a

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,799
disclaimer in them

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,880
um this is fairly rare these days i

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,440
haven't i can't think of one in the last

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,039
year where we've had a release like that

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,559
um and finally you need to put the

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,600
release in the correct

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,640
place there actually has to be in the

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,200
apache

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,320
mirror distribution system as well as

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
anywhere else that you want to

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,960
want to put it

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,519
so just a note on binary distributions

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,200
here

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,600
so they're not considered official

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,200
releases but they still need to comply

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,960
with asf policies and guidelines and

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,200
and all the rest so it's best if you

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
if you also treat those as as a real

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,799
release and mo

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,000
what most projects do is release both

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,799
the

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,320
source and the binary distribution that

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,840
at the same time

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,679
and as i've mentioned a few times now

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,640
that the license and notice file may be

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,320
different

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
uh because the contents of the binary

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,360
distribution

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,039
is going to be different from the source

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,840
release well may be different in some

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:05,279
cases it's not

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,079
so that's about it from

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,040
me so maybe just one thing before i

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,040
finish up

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,720
is that you know if you're new to this

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,520
and you're just an incubating project

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,119
starting out

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,800
you may be a bit confused about some of

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,240
these policies and you know what the

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,560
right thing is to do

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,240
and so where can you go for help well

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,879
the best place is to ask on your

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,639
your own mailing list uh your mentors

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,399
there should be following along and they

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
will be able to help you

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,720
uh if they don't you can ask your

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,159
mentors directly

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,839
and if they can't help either then you

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,879
can always ask the

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,119
incubating incubator

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,480
project itself there's a mailing list

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,079
called general incubator

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,919
apache.org and that will

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,359
is also a good place to have a look you

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,639
can look at previous releases that have

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,560
been made recently

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,240
and see how the boat's gone on those and

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,440
you can also see you know some common

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,200
issues where

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,880
other releases maybe not have been

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,720
successful on the first time

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,320
and what they've run into if you've got

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,160
an issue with the licensing

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,520
then the legal discuss mailing list is

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,800
the best place to

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,560
do that so just

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,200
finally um the incubator we're here to

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,920
help and if you've got any suggestions

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
on

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,720
how documentation will process or

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,280
anything can be improved

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,040
please email us and we're happy to talk

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,960
about it

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,079
so that's it from me i'm just going to

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,160
open it up for

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,200
questions now and i'll see i haven't

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,079
been looking at the chatters i've been

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
giving this so

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,520
hopefully there's already a couple of

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,280
questions there that i

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:45,839
can answer all right

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,839
let's have a look what we've got here

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,599
uh nick i can see you've got a question

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,520
there uh

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,280
saying that this can be hard i'm not

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,839
sure what you're referring to by

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,839
this do you mind if you

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:13,839
put that up there

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,400
yeah i think what you're saying there is

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,680
that yeah this it is best if this work

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,160
is done in the open

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,920
and discussed because you'll often offer

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,440
the more people that can

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,760
can look at this the

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,440
better yeah yeah exactly yeah

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,040
so you just typed in the channel there

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,240
that all discussion needs to be open in

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,079
public

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,680
so yeah if this is discussed in the open

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,800
then more people are going to have eyes

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,320
on it and more people are going to have

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,680
input to it and it's more likely that

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,800
it's going to be

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,440
be correct julian asks why do i hate

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,560
cats

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:58,079
i don't hate cats i quite like cats

00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,800
but uh yeah uh and do we have any

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,839
other questions uh nick also says that

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,119
that

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,440
things like the mysql exception for

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,920
apache i don't believe there is a mysql

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,480
for apache

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,520
mysql is not under a compatible license

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,800
and

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,560
it can't be

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,760
a dependency of an apache project

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,800
unless it's optional so that means that

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,560
you might have

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
say two or three database engines that

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,040
you could use

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,119
and because mysql uh

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,280
is one of those three you could use it

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,480
but it could not be

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,320
a pure dependency with no

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:51,839
other database engines is my

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:51,839
understanding of that

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,480
yeah they um

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,200
i'm not sure where that discussion took

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,520
place nick about mysql but the um

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,520
it's certainly not mentioned in the

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,839
uh legal faq page

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,960
you're saying that they called it a foss

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,599
except

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
exception the problem with that is that

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,480
it still

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,760
puts a restriction upon the on the

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,119
apache license and

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,000
basically means that it couldn't be used

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:44,400
for commercial purposes when software

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,599
under the apache license can be so

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,119
i'd be interested to know where that

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,359
discussion took place if you could point

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,640
me out to it no not

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,480
be there there's certainly nothing in

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,119
the the legal faq that we've currently

00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:01,839
got that

00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:01,839
that mentions this

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,640
all right if there are no other

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,800
questions i think we'll we'll

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,680
call that a day because it's about time
