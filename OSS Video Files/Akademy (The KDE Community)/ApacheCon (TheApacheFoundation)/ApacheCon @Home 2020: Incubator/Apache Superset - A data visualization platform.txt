This talk explores Apache Superset through a live demo, and provides a high level understanding of what it offers as a product. We'll also share our journey thus far, and explore what it takes to grow an open source project, a community and a movement. We'll look at a retrospective of the design decisions, technology choices and engineering challenges that have shaped Superset. We'll also take a deep look into the current challenges the community is currently facing, and peak at what is ahead.
