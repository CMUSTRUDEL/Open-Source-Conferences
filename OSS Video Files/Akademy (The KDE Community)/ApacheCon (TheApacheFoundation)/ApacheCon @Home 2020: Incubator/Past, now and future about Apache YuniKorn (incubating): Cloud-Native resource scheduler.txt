Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) is a light-weight, universal resource scheduler for container orchestrator systems. It was created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant, and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform, scheduling experience for mixed workloads that consist of stateless batch workloads and stateful services. YuniKorn now supports K8s and can be deployed as a custom K8s scheduler. YuniKorn's architecture design also allows adding different shim-layer and adapt to different ResourceManager implementation including Apache Hadoop YARN, or any other systems. For this talk, we will talk about gaps in resource scheduling in Cloud-Native environment, and how YuniKorn can support running big data applications (like Spark/Flink/Tensorflow, etc.) on K8s. We will talk about existing and upcoming features of YuniKorn (including hierarchical of queues, resource fairness, gang scheduling support, integration with K8s features, quota management, autoscaling, etc.). We will also share how YuniKorn being used in community partners such as Alibaba, Cloudera, Lyft.

Wilfred is a Staff Software Engineer from Cloudera in Australia. Heâ€™s also PMC member of Apache YuniKorn (incubating), Apache Hadoop committer. He has worked on Hadoop for 6 years mainly on YARN, MapReduce, and Spark. Before Cloudera, he has worked for SUN Microsystems and Oracle as part of the Identity Management teams as a developer and consultant for over 10 years. Wilfred started his career as a lecturer at the Amsterdam University of Applied Science; teaching, designing, and implementing multiple IT systems. Wilfred holds a Master's in Decision Support Systems from Sunderland University. Wangda Tan is Sr. Manager of Compute Platform engineering team @ Cloudera, responsible for all engineering efforts related to Kubernetes, Apache Hadoop YARN, Resource Scheduling, and internal container cloud. In the open-source world, he's a member of Apache Software Foundation (ASF), PMC Chair of Apache Submarine project, He is also project management committee (PMC) members of Apache Hadoop, Apache YuniKorn (incubating). Before joining Cloudera, he leads High-performance-computing on Hadoop related work in EMC/Pivotal. Before that, he worked in Alibaba Cloud and participated in the development of a distributed machine learning platform (later became ODPS XLIB).
