Apache Teaclave (incubating) is a universal secure computing platform to make computation on privacy-sensitive data safe and secure. The platform adopts multiple security technologies to enable secure computing, in particular, Teaclave uses Intel SGX to serve the most security-sensitive tasks with hardware-based isolation, memory encryption and attestation. Teaclave is provided as a function-as-a-service platform and with many built-in functions, it supports a wide variety of tasks on sensitive data, such as privacy preserving machine learning, private set intersection, and cryptographic computation. More importantly, unlike traditional FaaS, Teaclave supports both general secure computing tasks and flexible single- and multi-party secure computation. Last but not least, Teaclave is written in Rust to prevent memory-safety issues. Teaclave entered the Apache Incubator in August 2019. In this talk, we would like to introduce this project to the whole community for the first time. We will discuss some motivation and background of the secure computing ecosystem. Then, we will present highlights of the Teaclave platform and its internal design, talk about the roadmap of incubating and current progress, and finally, introduce current status of Teaclave community.

Mingshen Sun works at Baidu and is a member of Apache Teaclave (incubating) PPMC (Podling Project Management Committee). He leads, maintains and actively contributes to several open source projects including Teaclave, MesaPy, Rust OP-TEE TrustZone SDK, etc. Please visit his homepage (https://mssun.me) for more information.
