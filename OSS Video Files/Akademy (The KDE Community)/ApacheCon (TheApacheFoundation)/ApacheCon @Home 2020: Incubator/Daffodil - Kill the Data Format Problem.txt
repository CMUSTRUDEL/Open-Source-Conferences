Daffodil is an incubator project. Its goal is killing the data format problem by providing an implementation of DFDL (Data Format Description Language - an emerging standard from the Open Grid Forum) that we can all use and extend, and integrate into all our data-consuming frameworks and applications. This talk will use numerous compelling examples of Daffodil parsing, and unparsing (reconstructing) data in a variety of data formats - textual and binary, industry standard formats, and ad-hoc one-of-a-kind formats as well, and using both XML and JSON to make the data tangible and visible.

Apache commiter since 2017. Currently applying knowledge of scalable computing systems and data format issues at Owl Cyber Defense Solutions (formerly Tresys Technology). Since 2002, Co-chair DFDL Workgroup of Open Grid Forum - working towards a standard for data format description so we can all stop solving this problem over and over again. Former life as a CTO of a few small/startup companies. Likes to program in Scala and to do data archeology to figure out data from just the bits.
