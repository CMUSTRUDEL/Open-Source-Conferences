Apache Geode offers super fast write-ahead-logging (WAL) persistence with a shared-nothing architecture that is optimized for fast parallel recovery of nodes or an entire cluster. In this talk, we will first introduce how Geode disk stores work. Then we will present the recent work to improve the performance of persistence recovery. With the analysis of Geode logs, we find that the performance of persistence recovery can be significantly improved by unblocking some of the server initialization threads and parallelizing the process of disk stores recovery. Our experiments have proved that persistence recovery becomes remarkably more scalable and efficient with the improved process.
