	Running a Apache Geode on Kubernetes

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

As application developers move workloads to Kubernetes, they expect data services to run on Kubernetes alongside their applications. Kubernetes excels at running stateless workloads, but how does it handle complex stateful applications such as Apache Geode, a distributed in-memory database? We will describe challenges faced while building a Geode operator for Kubernetes, including controlling pod terminations, working with a dynamic network, and ensuring state management during the lifecycle of the deployment. We will explain the solutions we took to control these challenges, and dive into how we tested these solutions. You will leave with an understanding of how we moved a system designed to run on bare metal to a Kubernetes environment, uniting your workloads with your data services.

Michael Oleske:
Michael is a software engineer on Apache Geode and Tanzu GemFire. He works on making Geode both run well and easy to deploy for Kubernetes.

Aaron Lindsey:
Aaron works as a software engineer on Apache Geode and VMware Tanzu GemFire, focusing on making Geode run well on Kubernetes. Outside of work, he enjoys hiking and backpacking in the Pacific Northwest mountains, and volunteering with his local community and church.
