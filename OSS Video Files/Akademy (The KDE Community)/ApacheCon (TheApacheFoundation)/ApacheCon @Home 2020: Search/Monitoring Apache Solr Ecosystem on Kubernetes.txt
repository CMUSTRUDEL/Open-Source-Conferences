Kubernetes is fast becoming the operating system for the Cloud and brings a ubiquity that has the potential for massive benefits for technology organizations. Applications/Microservices are moved to orchestration tools like Kubernetes to leverage features like horizontal autoscaling, fault tolerance, CICD and more. Apache Solr can be deployed on Kubernetes on a large-scale for a plethora of use cases. For such scale, effective metric dashboards, log analytics, monitoring, and alerting system is a requirement to make sure abnormal behaviors are detected, error diagnostics are performed and the ability to fine-tune the entire ecosystem to reach the best possible performance. In this talk, we discuss and compare various monitoring and analytics tools for the Solr ecosystem running on Kubernetes. From inbuilt features to third-party tools which provide powerful yet easy to use dynamic dashboards and OpenTracing support.
