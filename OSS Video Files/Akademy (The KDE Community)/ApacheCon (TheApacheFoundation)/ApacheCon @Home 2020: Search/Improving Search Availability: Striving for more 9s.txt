Availability is a critical aspect of any distributed system, especially when your customer's mission critical applications depend on it. But what does availability really mean for Search and how do we measure it? Once measured how do we ensure a multi-cluster deployment of Apache Solr with terabyte scale sharded inverted index hits the holy grail of 4 9s of availability ? How do we automatically detect failures with such systems and what are our options to handle and recover from such failures without human intervention ? In this talk we will discuss various architectural choices and deployment strategies we have adopted at Box to improve availability of search while supporting high-throughput, near real-time indexing, low latency and multi-tenancy. We will share our learnings from various issues we have faced running Solr at scale and how we have address them by building additional scaffolding or tweaking Solr itself. Come take a peek under the hood of Box Search.

Shubhro enjoys working with data at scale, be it indexing, mining or analyzing it. Currently he is part of the Search team at Box, building infrastructure components that enable millions of users to find relevant content. Prior to Box, Shubhro worked on full text database search at Oracle. He has been working on enterprise search and data discovery for the past 8 years after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with Masters in Information Systems, specializing in Information Retrieval and Machine Learning.
