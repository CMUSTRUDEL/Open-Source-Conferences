Description: 
	Open Source Docs as Code
Cassandra Targett

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

This talk will review the Lucene community's experiences maintaining Solr documentation in the same way we maintain code. Prior to 2016, the Solr Reference Guide was only in Confluence (cwiki). Despite community agreement that docs are important, editing them was a separate process that was easy to put off. That put a burden on a few committers to update the content for each new release, and frequently each version's Guide was not complete for 2-3 months after a release was announced. In 2016 we decided to integrate the documentation with our source code. We converted Confluence pages to AsciiDoc files and started generating static HTML pages hosted in our main website. These changes allowed committers to update documentation as they changed the code. In an open source project where everyone is a volunteer and there are possibly only 1-2 people who understand any feature, this has been an incredibly empowering change. Today committer maintenance of docs is high enough that the Guide requires very little effort to prepare for publication. All Release Managers can publish it as part of the release process, reducing the burden on the few who knew their way around the old system. This engagement means the Guide can evolve quickly as community needs change. In this talk I'll share how we made these choices, the content and build tools we use, and how other projects can make updating docs a natural part of the code change process.

Cassandra has 20 years experience in search and knowledge management. She has been an Apache Lucene committer since 2013 and a member of the PMC since 2016. As Director of Engineering at Lucidworks, she manages the day-to-day work of the Solr development team.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,199
uh hello everyone

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
uh welcome to the search track at

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,760
apachecon at home 2020.

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
uh for this session we have with us

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,719
cassandra target

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480
a long time listening community member

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,399
pmc member and committer

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,239
uh she's here to talk about open source

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,480
talks as code and will be sharing with

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,399
us

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,239
uh the scene communities experience

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,280
maintaining solar documentation

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,719
in the same way as we maintain code as

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
one of the key contributors and the

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
driver

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
of this evolution she will walk through

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,000
the evolution of this process

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,160
and how other projects can make updating

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,879
documentation a natural part of the code

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,879
change process

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,119
okay sorry i feel like i'm flying really

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,600
blind

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,320
uh at the moment since i can't hear

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
anybody or

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,880
see my own slides or anything so uh here

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,759
goes please in the chat let me know if i

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,400
drop out

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,880
um or you can't see slides or whatever

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,479
uh

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,759
but as antrim uh explained we're going

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,799
to talk a little bit about

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,240
um docs's code as a concept for open

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
source projects

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,920
um so get started i'm cassandra target i

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
know

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
angela introduced me i'm on the lucian

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,799
pmc

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
i'm gonna have my contact info at the

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
end as well um

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
my day during my day job i'm director of

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
engineering at

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,000
uh lucidworks um

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,119
so uh all right so what does uh

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
we're talking about today we're going to

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,479
talk about um what is doctor's code what

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
is it um

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
a bit about the evolution of solar's

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,759
documentation where we started and kind

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
of where we're at now

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
uh the tools and the workflow that we

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,879
use and then talk a little bit about

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,360
if it's right uh for you or if you end

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,840
your project

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
so what does docs's code mean basically

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
it means to treat

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
documentation the same with the same

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,760
principles as code

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,319
right so your documentation files are

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
stored

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,560
in your project source repository your

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
build tools generate docs for

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
publication

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
edits are treated the same way as code

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,680
changes um

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,519
generally you know basically you treat

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
document and treat documentation as

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,040
though it was code

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
and in a sense you know that makes a lot

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,840
of workflow

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,640
situations easier um so

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
uh some i've seen some projects store

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
their

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,800
documentation files in a separate

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
repository that kind of violates a bit

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
of the philosophy because

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,560
the main point is to kind of keep out

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,360
keep everything for your project in one

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
spot

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
um but i i've also seen it scenic kind

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
of work

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,560
when you do this there's kind of an

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,760
implicit assumption here

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,480
that uh your your documentation files

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,720
are really just in a simple text format

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
and um you know you're not actually

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,239
generating massive pdfs and storing your

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,680
documentation and saying we're doing

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,760
docs with code

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
you know the basically the raw content

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
files are what you're storing and you're

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
treating them the same as you treat your

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
classes

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,519
you know of your javascripts like any

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
any other pieces of code

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,680
that you use and integrating with your

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,239
existing tools is also key

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,159
storing it in one place is is you're

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
storing it all in the same place is fine

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,400
but um you know if you're not using the

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,360
same kind of tools you're really not

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,799
treating that documentation as code

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,560
so we know i i think lots of folks have

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,840
seen this survey before this is from

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,680
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,000
um of open source survey.org um

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,439
you know 93 percent of respondents said

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,480
that incomplete or confusing

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,640
documentation

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,599
is a is a problem in open source

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
projects

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,000
as members of open source projects we

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,200
know kind of some reasons why

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,640
that you know why that can happen um and

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
you know the the reasons are often

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
complex but ultimately

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
and it happens to me all the time just

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
boils down to time

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,959
you know how much time are you able to

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,600
are you as a project

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,320
able to spend on documentation um

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
obviously there's

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,759
other obstacles such as maybe not

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,240
understanding what users need

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
maybe the application is too complex and

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,479
needs some ease of use

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,040
um and you know you may also in a global

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
diverse

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,720
community may have some percentage of

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,400
your

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,759
community that doesn't feel comfortable

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
writing in

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
uh the primary language of the

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,080
documentation and they need some

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
assistance

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,759
and for all of these things stop this

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,520
code can really help because the more

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
you remove the barriers

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,240
to uh to editing documentation and

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
working with documentation the easier it

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
is to spend time on some of these

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
other issues like making sure all your

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
updates are done before you do a release

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,320
helping out other members helping them

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
with copy editing or just giving them a

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,759
thumbs up that their documentation

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,000
is fine um

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,880
so i'll get back into uh some of these

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
some of these reasons

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,560
uh at the end but let's start talking

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
about the solar reference guide

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,320
um so uh the soul reference guide is

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
is published by the apache listing

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
community the apache

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,800
scene obviously publishes patchy lucien

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
it also is responsible for apache solar

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
um we are going to be probably moving to

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,520
a top-level project

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
solar is going to be moving into a

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,360
top-over project soon uh but for now

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,520
we'll come all together

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
um so the sole reference guide is the

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
comprehensive guide to everything about

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
solar

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,600
um we're up to 245 pages this is

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,400
individual documentation files it's uh

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
which is a lot

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
um it's actually pretty big um it's

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
version for

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
every minor release so if we do like a

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,880
bug fix release like 863 like we're not

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
going to

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,759
release the documentation but 8.5 and

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
8.6 and 8.7 there's a whole new version

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
of the guide

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
it's a mix of tutorial reference

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
how-to's

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
um needs more of the how-to and more the

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
tutorial but

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,440
uh it's it's getting there um

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,880
so uh all right so

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,120
how do we get to the solar reference guy

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,199
doesn't exist today um the original dock

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
from the beginning of time with solar

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
uh were in the old moin moin wiki the

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
old wiki

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
um and it was it was actually it was

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
okay i mean it was

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
good you know actually for for

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,319
documentation maintain and wiki it's

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
better than others um that i've seen

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,840
but it um but it was kind a little bit

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
of a mishmash of

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,000
versions in the same page right so when

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,560
you first look at this page

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
before you start trying to read it you

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
you see these kind of

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
you know like warning triangles that say

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,560
oh this section's only for this version

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
but it doesn't really it's not totally

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,720
clear how

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,720
um you know which parts of the page are

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,599
only for the specific version

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,440
um the developers you know our community

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,199
relies pretty heavily on developers

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,000
editing documentation

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
um and the developers did a reasonably

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,039
good job keeping it up to date partially

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
because they didn't really need to worry

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,840
about versioning it right like they

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,479
could just update it whenever and say oh

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,160
yeah and in 3.2 i added this feature

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:25,199
even if it was 3.5 please um

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,960
so in uh 2010 lucidworks my company um

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
started uh produced this thing called

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
the solar reference guide

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,240
and it they hired some technical writers

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,280
to write it like professional

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
people and um released it as a pdf that

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
you had to give your email address to

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
marketing to

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,639
in order to get um in uh

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,240
um shortly after that you know some

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
period of time i realized it wasn't

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
the best marketing tool that we ever

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,240
came up with so

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,759
we actually put it on our in confluence

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
actually in the conference that

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
the company hosted and made it available

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,120
that way

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
so the community was still maintaining

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879
the wiki documentation and loserworks

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,160
was maintaining this kind of parallel

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,360
documentation

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,759
so in 2013 we

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,720
moved we actually the company donated it

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
to the asf

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
and the community agreed to take it on

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,800
as the official documentation

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,879
uh so it moved actually from the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
listworks conference into the apache

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,240
conference it's pretty much pretty

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,479
straight uh migration

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
um this actually worked pretty well it

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
was you know kind of parody with what

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,039
was there

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
and it would make you know offensively

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,399
maintained by the community

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
uh but there are some issues with

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
confluence there's some issues that like

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,399
trying to document a pretty big

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,959
application with a lot of different

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,000
files

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,519
in confluence um the biggest being that

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
the editing experience was kind of

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
painful

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,440
um i actually used confluence very

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
recently

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
it's actually a lot better than it was

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,080
in this time frame somewhere between

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,080
2013 and 2019

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
uh they were transitioning into kind of

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,000
a new way of editing

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
editing pages um and that pa that

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
process was a bit painful

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,920
um and you know honestly developers kind

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
of avoided making changes until the

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
release time

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
so uh that because and it was completely

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,880
different process

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,360
there in the code working with patches

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,680
working with at the time it was sdn

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,640
uh you know working working that way and

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
then it was

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,240
move over to confluence with a painful

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
kind of editing experience and

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
remember how to do that and write it um

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,320
and

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
write up what you just changed uh so you

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
know

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,519
it's fair it's fair um but what that

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,440
kind of turned into is that

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
trying to do a release of a version of

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
the of the

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,560
new reference guide for a new release

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
was really manual and took a lot of

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,000
effort

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,080
um ultimately you know someone would

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,839
need to manually look at every single

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
jira issue that was modified

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,360
try to look it up in the rough guide

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
figure out if documentation had been

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,080
made

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
documentation changes had been made keep

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
track of who looked at what and whether

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
they looked at it whether it needed

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,240
editing

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
you know try to chase down the developer

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
you know see if he or she had time

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,440
to help out and see if they had time to

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
do documentation

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
all of this took forever updates were

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,160
delayed the guide was

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,640
often released missing changes um and

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
months weeks to months after the actual

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,600
release

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
um so it just wasn't it wasn't a great

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
system at all and

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,880
and honestly there were only a couple

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
people who were taking on the brunt of

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,160
that work

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,839
um and and they weren't uh having been

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,880
one of them we weren't all that precise

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
about it

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,800
um the uh and also we couldn't have

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,120
version specific online dogs

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,839
actually so online so we only had this

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,560
pdf that was the only version snapshot

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
so if you went googling for what you

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
know the

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,640
that possible values for a parameter

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
were and you end up with the solar

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
reference guide

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
you might end up looking at

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,079
documentation for a version much later

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
than the one you're using

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
and there's no way to kind of get that

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,800
get you there

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
so uh i actually being wise i've

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
mentioned one of the people that did a

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,360
lot of this

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
uh really like chased at all of this and

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
it was really bothering me

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
um and i had already started hearing

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,880
about docs's code

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
um so i you know i started thinking

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
about how i could make that work it

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
seemed like something that would really

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,760
work for our community

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
because uh you know our developers

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
actually did

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,800
seem to want to do documentation edits

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,680
and they already had in the past with

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
the wiki

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
um they just really probably needed it

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,399
to be easier and more integrated

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,279
so uh i i didn't i knew that i wanted to

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
move to

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,320
uh ascii doc as a format and i'll talk

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,519
about why

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,360
uh in in a bit um i

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,680
knew from looking at ascii doc that

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,079
there's a project called fbdocker

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
that uh i like the philosophies behind

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,040
the tool chain it's open source the

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,720
community was open

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,480
um it was ruby based which is a bit

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,000
different start project's in java so i

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,079
wasn't sure about that part

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,200
um but essentially in labor day 2015

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,600
i made i started a proof of concept um

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
and uh just on my own just to see if i

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
could try to figure out

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,880
and make it work um i figured out pretty

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
quickly that i was gonna need a static

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,480
site generator for this content

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,920
um because of uh navigation and and some

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
other things that i would want the

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,560
documentation site to have

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
um so a lot of it was figuring out which

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,120
documentation

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
you know which are which static site

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,200
generator to use

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,120
and uh it was about a year actually

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,560
before i got it into a state that was

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,360
ready to make a proposal with the

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,839
community

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
and i was really happy that it was

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
really well received

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,279
um and honestly though it still took

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,120
about a year to get it over the final

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,760
hurdle it was may 2017 that we finally

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
uh finally moved it moved everything out

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
of confluence

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
um and we kept our scope pretty pretty

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,320
small

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,720
um there was a you know everyone had a

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,079
ton of ideas of stuff we could do

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,000
um which is always wonderful except um

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,839
you know we needed to to kind of keep it

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,079
keep it so that we could get it done

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
um so you know basically what we did we

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,680
converted the pages to ascii doc format

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,399
we developed we've made the build

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,160
tooling uh the release process

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
um and then we made we basically just

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
said let's just have parody with layout

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
and functionality anything fancier than

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
that we'll work on later

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
so this is what it looks like actually

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,720
and it's not too different um

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,320
we got to pick our own colors um

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,639
as opposed to the last one which we were

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
stuck kind of with uh the generic asf

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,680
one

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,880
um all of this stuff actually so this

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,120
orangish nav

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,399
bar on the top and this hierarchical

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
thing on the side

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
this um this was all from the this is

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
all generated by the static site

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,639
generator

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,320
jekyll in our case this stuff in the

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,040
middle all comes for it

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,040
all comes from uh ascii doctor

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,519
um so what did we actually build so

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,160
um for tooling you know and uh uh

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,079
and build kind of stuff we obviously you

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,839
know once we did this change

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,600
changes that needed to happen to docs

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,279
they went through they go through jira

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,279
um we have a bit of an unwritten rule it

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,240
says if it's just like a typo there's

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,040
kind of no need for uh for making a big

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
jira

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,639
for making a jira issue for it uh

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,519
committers can be trusted to just have

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,040
fixes

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,199
um a project uses git and github um so

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
if you have a pull request um if you

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
want to make edits to docs

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
you can create a pull request as a

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,040
contributor and hopefully you know

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,720
we'll be able to uh we'll be able to

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
take a look at it um

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
when we made this transition we were

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
using um ant we've sent

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
moved to gradle which is actually making

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
things a lot easier

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,120
uh so we actually still both going on

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
and we have regular jenkins jobs that

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
run

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,360
every time a um once an hour the jenkins

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
jobs look and see if there's any commits

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,240
and they build the documentation

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,399
so we see um you know on the on the

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,040
branches we care about we see where

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,399
we we know if the if the documentation

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,560
is broken in some way

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:58,079
and it won't build um as i mentioned

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,320
we are using uh ascii dr jekyll and a

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,079
gem that it kind of integrates them um

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,560
both of those are ruby projects so

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,160
this is the ruby gem jekyll sd dock that

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,320
does the html conversion

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,360
right so i'll show you some nc doc files

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
and basically we

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
just take those and we turn them into

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,519
html files

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,040
um we have some java classes that build

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,680
the page hierarchy because

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,680
one of the first things um i i think i

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,600
was going to manually maintain the

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,760
entire page hierarchy in a big

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,320
like json file and uh uh

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,360
um haas actually in the community said

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
you know that's crazy

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
why don't we just why don't i just build

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,839
let me just write a java class that will

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,320
build it automatically

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,399
um so we have that so that's actually a

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
you know simplification uh that just

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
makes it easier

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
um as well you know it builds the

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,120
hierarchy automatically no one has to

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,720
manually maintain anything

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,399
um we have a solar project has a

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
a thing called we call pre-commit i

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,079
don't know how many other projects do

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
this

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,519
um but it's basically validation of code

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,399
changes because they don't violate some

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
of our rules

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,680
you know kind of sort of a pre-check

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,279
that it's going to work

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
um that validation actually includes

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,279
documentation as well

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
um so it checks and make sure that the

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,839
you know that there weren't changes to

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,720
documentation that are going to break

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,079
the build

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,000
um so that's a uh um so that's that's

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,079
pretty key too so in this we've actually

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,800
integrated it pretty tightly in each one

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,519
of these

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,720
processes that already existed um that

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
already existed for

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,079
uh you know for building our software

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,079
developing our software

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,839
um on a project level actually we've

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,120
also integrated and you know kind of

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,120
tightly by um pulling variables

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,519
out from the branch that we don't have

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,480
to maintain inside documentation that's

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
the version

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,320
right so the branch knows what version

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,800
it is and so the branch

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,399
just you know so the documentation just

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,320
pulls what version it is

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,839
out of the branch the same for

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
dependency versions on

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
outgoing dockling so you know we have a

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,399
few dependencies that um

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,959
users can interact with pretty closely

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,120
and

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,679
uh you know with documentation in the

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,079
solar reference guide that links out to

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,760
those tools right so that people can

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,520
learn more about them

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,919
those links are versioned and the

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,319
versions aren't manually maintained they

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
come

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,000
from the branch that we're pulling off

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
of so the documentation users get

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
sent to is the documentation for the

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,760
version of the dependency

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
that's for the version of the docs

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,880
they're reading okay

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,720
our javadoc links also do that um we

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,120
also have some of the code examples

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,400
in um in the documentation are actually

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,039
taken from tests

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,520
um in the sort that are in the source so

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,640
um some of our documentation is actively

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
being tested

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
every time we run the test suite for the

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,440
software um which is

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,480
we need to do a ton more of um and

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
uh you know it's pretty pretty handy and

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,919
you know shows one of the major benefits

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
of integrating these things pretty

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,799
deeply is that if you have a lot of code

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,880
examples

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,160
you know keeping them up to date is a

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
bit of a um

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
is a bit of a you know can be a chore at

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,559
times you have to remember to

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
update it manually somewhere um if you

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,960
pull it

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,320
you know if you if you're able to just

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
kind of insert them

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,280
um then uh in into your

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,400
into your into your documentation then

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,600
it's uh

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
um it's much smoother

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,240
so as i mentioned confluence didn't

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,200
allow us to host uh virgin documents

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,200
online so

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
we actually kind of considered the pdf

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
version the official version because it

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
was the only thing that we could make a

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,640
snapshot of

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,120
and even when we switched to the docs as

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,160
code

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,440
model we still considered the html

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
the convenience version you know because

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,360
the pdf

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,760
is an artifact that gets downloaded we

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
you know interpreted the asf policy as

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
meaning like we needed to have a vote on

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,039
it

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
we needed to host it on this.apache.org

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,160
we needed to

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,600
you know basically treat it as a release

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,600
artifact

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,360
and um that uh you know added some

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,120
added you know added some weight to the

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,840
release process um

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,000
so we also actually had two separate

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,160
converters we had one that made the html

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
and a second have made the pdf i mean we

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
could make a we made an ant target that

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
did both at the same time but it was

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
still kind of two separate things to

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
maintain

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
they actually required separate versions

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
of ascii docker it was complement

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
and there were some things just with the

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,200
presentation and design

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,919
of the page that we wanted to be able to

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
do

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,400
um that we kind of couldn't do in html

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,520
because we needed to make sure the

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,240
content would

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,240
work properly in the pdf right and

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,679
there's obviously like javascript things

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
and things that you could do on a page

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
that you can't do in a pdf and so

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,440
we found ourselves kind of doing some

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,440
gymnastics so um

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,880
oh and the pdf actually as i said

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,080
there's 245

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,960
html pages uh there were

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,799
pages to the pdf um and i there's some

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,760
content that i know is coming hopefully

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
sometime soon

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,799
that probably would have taken that up

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,440
to 2000 pages

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,120
which is pushing the limits of a pdf

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
even if you're in love with even if you

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,280
really

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,760
enjoy pdf um so our workflow today

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,159
actually

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
is it's a lot simpler um you know

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,840
whenever release manager come initiates

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,120
the code release process

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,120
um we i do i actually just do i spend an

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
afternoon kind of comparing commits that

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
i've seen come through on the

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
documentation

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,640
to the uh to the jiras that have been

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,039
changed

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,880
uh just to see if anything's changed um

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
i mentioned before and confluence you

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
know

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
developers really avoided it i would say

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,720
maybe on a good

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,960
release we would get a quarter to a

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,280
third of the developers and gate you

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,320
know having done the documentation

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,039
and easily now this process i mean all

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,120
this process

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
is is me just checking things off a list

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,600
um because

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,320
90 at least is done already

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,760
um there's very very few uh changes that

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
need to be done and usually those are

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,960
just things that i

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,240
maybe know i mentioned in the docs i

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
need to look them up

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,799
maybe i just need to ask somebody a

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
quick question like are you sure this

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,720
doesn't need documentation

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
um and and quite often it's oh no i

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,640
thought of that

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,640
and i i decided it didn't um so

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,799
you know the developer engagement in

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
writing maintaining the documentation

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
has just gone through the roof to the

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
point where

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
someone like me whose only real

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,919
contribution to the community is

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
documentation

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,960
um i can start doing other stuff um

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,480
which i'll

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,080
talk about in a second um the uh

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
so once the vote once the release

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,320
manager starts to vote for the new

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,640
release

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,799
the uh um i you know generally right at

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,039
that moment i mean i'm we're ready

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,440
to push uh we push to our production

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,000
site our html pages for the new rep

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
guide for

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
that version but they have a draft

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,520
watermark across them basically saying

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
this is a draft it's not done yet

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,280
because the release isn't out

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,280
um the minute the release manager pushes

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,440
the code you know the code binaries the

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,679
artifacts that the release itself

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,919
um the final html version that that

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,559
removes that draft watermark is pushed

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,039
um so it's uh you know delays only based

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,440
on

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,559
when i get up and read my email usually

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
um so

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,000
uh we haven't integrated this this is an

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,640
automatic that the release manager

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,080
does this yet i'm not sure why we're

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,039
still not making it automatically i

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,080
think it's just me

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,840
needing to like give up the ring um and

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,000
i think we could do it actually

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,280
um so this actually this process might

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,400
just be a little bit of a

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,200
quick check and then let it go um which

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,200
makes it

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
makes life way way simpler from what it

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,159
was um

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,880
so um so html

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
kind of layout customization um so when

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,919
we started this like

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,320
some of the reason why it looks the way

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,039
it did is that i really had no idea what

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
i was doing

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,120
um i you know i was kind of facing this

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,559
like well we're gonna need to

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,360
write you know if we're gonna need to

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,039
make our own html site like pages

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,880
um i don't know where really where to

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,559
start so i found this thing called the

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,600
jekyll documentation

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,919
theme uh which is by tom johnson um

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,880
that uh did most of what i wanted to do

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,600
um actually

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
was that entire original layout you saw

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
um

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
and uh oh sorry tom johnson is a

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,039
technical writer active in

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,159
science docs's co docs's code uh uh uh

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,320
advocacy um and you know

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,880
this actually this is a snippet actually

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,600
of the html from jekyll

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,799
which um uh you know via jekyll which is

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
basically the page

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,159
template for our forward documentation

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,440
page

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,159
um so in 2018 actually i'd learned a ton

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,080
more

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,080
um and was able to maneuver my way

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,559
around some of this and so i actually

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,559
changed

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,919
everything

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,360
for uh to indicate sections of the page

00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,480
um uh you know

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120
we actually in 2020 this year

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
i launched into a complete redesign of

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,799
the entire

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
reference guide and i initially just

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,240
kind of wanted to upgrade bootstrap and

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
realize that the theme that we'd

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,760
inherited that i had

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
frankenstein into something because not

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,880
knowing what i was doing

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,640
had just turned into had made that

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,039
really literally impossible

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,320
um so i needed to kind of read like back

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,600
out a ton of stuff so

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,720
i um this is the latest design it's not

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,159
too different

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,760
um but uh um it said you know

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,200
i pulled out a bunch of javascript that

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
we're not using um

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,799
we still have this hierarchical

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
navigation um this it's actually the

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,760
page is

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
much more responsive now um and hard to

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,159
tell from these screenshots but

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,760
uh actually the old site we used a very

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,440
narrow kind of view

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,200
and left a lot if you had a big monitor

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,600
left a lot of white space on the screen

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,480
and this actually expands to fill your

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
screen so

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,679
if you're using a big monitor and

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,760
there's a big screenshot on it you'll be

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
able to see the whole thing

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,039
um there's multiple phases of this

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,840
redesign um

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,039
so this is phase one with the the um

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,080
look and feel

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,320
phase two is actually tackling this um

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,679
it's gonna be tackling this bit massive

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,880
list of top level

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,919
sub uh topic headings um that we have

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,880
um and i'm i work on that a little bit

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,600
whenever i have time in my spare time um

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,640
so it's not

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,520
moving that fast but uh probably in 2025

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,799
i'll be like well back in 2019 i started

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,880
uh but anyway um so uh all right so

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,919
let's talk a little bit about like sort

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
of that's

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,960
where we're at with the rep guide and

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,600
let's talk a little bit about

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,799
um if you wanted to try to experiment

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,039
with some of this for

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,320
for your project um kind of the first

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
thing you need to figure out is what

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,000
format are the files gonna be in

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,520
um you know uh and basically i think it

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,679
really comes down to two choices

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,080
markdown or ascii doc um and you know i

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,440
said i preferred ascii doc and i and i

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,159
do and and the reason

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
why is it it's a lot more flexible it

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,480
has support for a lot more types of

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,760
elements that i want to be able to use

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,880
so tables cross references footnotes

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,159
includes um the ascii doctor tool chain

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,279
actually i think is what brings in the

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,159
includes but

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,000
um you know i can get it accudock was

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,360
was designed from the start

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,080
it started off as a python um thing

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,919
tool i'm not sure how to phrase it um

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,600
and was ported to ruby

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,279
but it's from its start has been

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,520
designed for writing

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,960
right it's been like it's for writing so

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,880
it's it's you know markdown

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,480
is the kind of two is for very simple

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,720
writing but um

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,600
you know markdown sorry affy docs kind

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,240
of got a little bit

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,919
more of the i'm gonna need to publish

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,919
this someday mindset

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,840
um the includes thing um that uh

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,360
um that i was mentioning is actually

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,799
something like this where

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,679
this is actually that this is a single

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,440
equal sign is a title of the page and

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,159
this is uh these are variables

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,000
um this is a a parameter but a variable

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,520
that is being set which says

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
you know i'm going to set this variable

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,039
called example source directory which is

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,080
this path

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,000
here and down here i'm basically i have

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,440
what i call what's called a source block

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,279
and i say i'm going to insert some

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,399
source code right here

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,640
and what this says it says include this

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,399
variable and then this path to this test

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,880
so this is the example i was saying

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,919
where we're actually including um code

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,480
that's in

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,720
another section of the repository that

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,320
gets tested as part of our test suite

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,480
as our example within the documentation

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,559
um and so we don't have to actually try

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,880
to maintain this this little snippet

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,880
just says go get that file

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,279
and there's a tag here actually so it

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,600
says go get that go get this section

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,799
of that file and put it in here put it

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,720
in the source block

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,320
um so that way we're just maintaining

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,840
code in one place we don't have to do it

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,360
twice

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,440
whenever you choose ascii doc or

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,039
markdown and i would absolutely say

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,279
if you don't think you're going to need

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
tables and fancy stuff and you've just

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,159
got

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,799
some simple documents mark that i marked

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,640
down

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,000
absolutely fine you don't need to go

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
fancier than

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,120
it works for your project but the

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,360
ultimate goal

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,640
here is to separate the writing and the

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,279
publishing right

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,840
so either one of these tools is going to

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,840
help

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,880
um it is going to help you quite a bit

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,320
in in

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
doing that um here's another view just

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,240
looking at

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,799
dot format in the context of um in the

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,799
context

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
of uh uh separating writing and the

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,919
publishing right so this is just some

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,240
basic text format i i

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,039
the author here said i want to tip and

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,360
then use two

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,600
equal signs to say a second level level

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,720
heading an h2 basically

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,799
um and uh this is actually how we our

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,600
convention for writing parameters

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,720
um and you know the author of this page

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,559
didn't need to worry about

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
making sure the green the little green

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
light bulb icon got inserted in the

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,679
right place and that there's this little

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,399
horizontal line and it's in a different

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,840
color

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,799
i mean the css and html like deal with

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
all of that

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,880
um entirely so the author here just

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,720
needs to say i want this to be a tip

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,000
that's as far as i need to go what the

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,080
tip actually looks like

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,399
is done um in a more sense you know in a

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,679
more centralized way

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,799
um the uh uh let's see uh

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,200
right okay okay so

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,880
uh jekyll is a static site generator

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
just to continue talking about tools a

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
little bit

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,360
um you know it's uh i think it's okay

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,919
it works for us i mean it's done well

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,480
for us

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,440
you know um phase three of my redesign

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,159
project

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,880
um is actually to reconsider other

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,399
options

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,640
the last time i really looked at this

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,919
was as i like five years ago and so i

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,039
would really like to look at

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:55,120
other site generators particularly the

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,399
folks actually are in the process of

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,279
developing one

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,880
um that is explicitly designed for

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,880
creating documentation

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,480
um and i i would really like to

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,760
experiment with that a little bit uh

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,399
when i have time

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,000
um but jekyll is fine um you know it's

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,679
easy to use it's very popular lots of

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,360
people use it so you find lots of stuff

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
on the internet if you have questions

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,559
um that the templates are reasonably

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,360
flexible

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,320
um and uh and pretty not too hard to

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,840
figure out

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,679
um the columns are really that it's

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,720
designed for blogs so

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,840
uh you know for example um you can

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,799
you know it can handle nested blog posts

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,480
like in a hierarchy pretty easily uh but

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,200
you try to do that to your pages and all

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,840
of a sudden

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,039
you lose control over like what your

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,039
urls are

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,200
um so you know if your site is very

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,039
simple jekyll's a good option

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,799
for something that's more complex than

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,279
ours um it's it's actually kind of

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,279
causing a little bit of friction

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,039
just in their documentation their ci

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,480
examples just aren't very diverse

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,120
um you know because they're in a very

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,159
like ruby world um so things like how do

00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,440
you

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,679
how do you get jekyll they're running

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,039
gradle um is that something we've had to

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,880
figure out on the road

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,240
um and anybody who needs to do that is

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,000
more than welcome to borrow

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,960
uh what we've done all right so to give

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,519
a uh let's see

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,600
uh to show another project example of

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
using aptidoc just as an example and

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
they don't use jekyll i actually don't

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,000
know what they used for build i knew it

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
one time and i've forgotten and i have a

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,279
feeling i changed it

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,039
um this is what hbase has done for their

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,720
documentation this is what i believe

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,960
they call the hbase book

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,279
um and no actually they do have they

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,320
have this hierarchy but this is actually

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,880
the content this all of this stuff is on

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,159
the same

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,880
html page um so they have

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,279
um so they've decided that their um

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
their

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,640
their content is split into into

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,159
chapters

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,279
but it is you know that they can

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,840
say they're gonna go with

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,720
generating it all onto one page um i

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,679
think that would be

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,720
too big of an html page for solar um but

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,640
it works for them

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,240
um and that's uh and that's great and

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,039
i'll show you this just to kind of show

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,039
you that

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,640
you know all the fancy hierarchy and

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,919
navigation and things like that you

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,919
don't have to have

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,440
um obviously they don't i mean i don't

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,960
know how they're generating this html

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,080
but they're probably not using much of a

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,159
static site generator

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,440
because they don't need page templates

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,720
they only need one

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,559
right so then they've got that um so

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,960
there's their organization actually is

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,039
pretty

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
that's just the organization of profile

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,080
structure of how they organize it

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,080
um they've got a css file they've got um

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,600
the book.adopt right and that's that

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,279
main book page

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,799
and if we were to look in the side of

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,799
this what what we see

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,360
is just a series of those little include

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,519
statements that i showed a minute ago

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,679
include this file include this file and

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,519
then the directory chapters is that it's

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,760
organized into the chapter

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,720
different chapters of of the the overall

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,399
book

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,200
this is a very simple structure and this

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,000
can be adapted by by lots of projects

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,360
um and uh you know in in whatever way

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,159
works for you

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,600
um i did uh oh i did forget one main

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,880
point actually before when i talk about

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,679
jekyll which is actually pretty

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,519
important

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,200
um i would actually say you know with

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,880
static site generators if you choose

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,960
markdown you actually have a ton more

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,559
options for static site generators

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,760
and as if i'm correct i think that

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,200
apache cms system was recently retired

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,399
and replaced with pelican

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,880
which is a static site generator which

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,440
supports markdown so if you want to go

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,799
that row

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,120
you want to go this route you actually

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,720
have a pretty built-in uh

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,360
solution available to you right here

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,799
um for the file structure just thinking

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,559
about just showing you kind of

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,080
what solar does this is some of the

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,640
stuff here like these first

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,240
three uh underscore directories here

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,799
data includes layout

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,080
um is uh is that that's the stuff that

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
has to be there for jekyll

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,000
um the templates actually is is how i

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,480
introduced html5

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,039
i actually had to write my own uh slim

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,760
template

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,640
for uh or we had to write our own slim

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,919
templates

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,240
uh for uh you know for for basically

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,079
what the elements are going to be but

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,800
then you notice actually this config

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,919
yaml

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:16,240
file that comes from jekyll 2. but then

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:19,520
all 245 of our uh you know of our files

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,599
are of our documentation content files

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,079
are just in a flat file right there

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,919
so uh so where um you know so that's uh

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
um so you know it's starting to get a

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,320
little annoying scrolling

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,359
scrolling scrolling through all the time

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,280
um

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,399
so that's uh so that's one another

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
reason why i want to look at different

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,960
static site generators um but as

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,800
as i said there are um there's a dozen

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
of them the world has moved on since the

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,440
last time i really looked at it uh

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,200
pelican i think we you know as

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,839
replacement for cms i think we've

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,440
had good experiences with um i found jay

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,359
bake really easy as well

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,720
that's again five years ago jekyll is

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,560
easy um

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,400
and there's and there's there's others

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,480
depending on your needs for your project

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,839
so you know kind of going back to you

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
know having gone through kind of all

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,640
this if we were to

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
kind of think about like what some of

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,680
what i would i would say some of the

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,800
benefits of

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,040
of docs's code are um the primary one

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,680
really is to just make documentation an

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,520
integral part of your project the deeper

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,880
that you can get it integrated

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,599
you know um into into the day-to-day

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
activities

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,640
the easier it's gonna be for everybody

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,480
to

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,240
participate in um update updating that

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,240
um the uh you know when we migrated from

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,119
when as we're migrating from amp into

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,520
gradle

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,240
you know i haven't had to ask for help

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,680
or

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,599
beg for someone to pay attention to

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,160
documentation you know in terms of

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,800
tooling

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,520
it's there and and it's gonna be there

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
and gradle

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,480
um and so you know the project just

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,079
makes a commitment that this is

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,960
important

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,440
um if you can simplify that

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,839
documentation change and review process

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,920
um you know your benefits are going are

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,640
going to to increase right the faster

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,280
the changes

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,800
can get in uh the better engaged

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,160
contributors are going to be

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,160
by suggesting improvements and um

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,760
and you know the bet the better

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,440
developers are going to be able to like

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,920
understand that it's pretty easy to just

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,200
make a change and do it and continue to

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,000
do that

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,440
um working your work with tool you get

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,560
to work with tools you're already using

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,320
which actually

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,400
you know reduces the amount of context

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,720
switching that you need to do in a day

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,720
on the project um you would have

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,599
complete flexibility in publication

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
process

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,280
really schedule all of that and

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,800
presentation so you want it to look a

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,599
certain way you can make it look that

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,520
way

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,680
um and i think you also have the ability

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,680
to diversify your contributor skill set

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,359
you know um you can have contributors

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,599
like making commits

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,640
who don't are you know who aren't

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,880
writing code

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,640
um which is you know which is me i've

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,760
never written a line of code in solar

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,760
ever and i believe i'm in the top 10 of

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,839
of contributors um just from writing

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,760
documentation um and that you know

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,880
as a perspective that kind of helps the

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,240
community kind of

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,800
look beyond uh known

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,800
no no known avenues of contribution

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,359
so just running out a little time don't

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,960
want to um go to and i want to try i

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,359
don't want to go over but um

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,400
uh you know so can it work for you um if

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,960
you want separation

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
of a writing and presentation um i think

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,160
you know it can

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,760
um if you like if you've been writing a

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,200
documentation confluence and you've got

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,720
no problems with it and it's working

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,920
fine for you there's absolutely nothing

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,920
wrong with that

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,520
but if you are chasing against some of

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,119
the the things and you'd like something

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
a little bit simpler

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
this is this is kind of this is an

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,560
approach that you can think about

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,079
um if you have a cultural enthusiasm

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,400
just generally amongst your

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,000
your developers contributor developer

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,160
and contributor community

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,520
um you know this i think this this is

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,839
the type of thing that makes it you know

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,079
but reduces the barriers to entry

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,440
and might uh you know would increase the

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,599
participation

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,040
um if you can customize the publication

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,720
process for your workflow so if you

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,440
actually have the ability to

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,720
you know customize your uh build

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,160
processes and things like that you're

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,760
like the technical skills

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,640
to do that um and same as for the um

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,280
oops sorry same as for the yes the html

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,720
and css

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,079
changes um would uh um you know

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,920
you need to be able to do both those

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,200
things if you are then this is something

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,599
that can work for you

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,440
um if you're in an environment where

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,000
like maybe your tooling is just not

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,079
flexible

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,160
for this and i had a hard time thinking

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,640
about like how that could happen but

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,800
it might um if you know if you're like

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,520
oh we need to redesign our entire build

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,760
system like

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,040
maybe this isn't an option for you maybe

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,040
something else is

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,240
um if you have and i wrote cultural

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,839
resistance and as i

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,280
as i was practicing i kept saying like i

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,119
don't really mean like you know

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,040
i think no one says like documentation

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,880
is bad or wrong or whatever

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,720
but i think sometimes people you may

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,520
have actually a

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,880
uh you know your application or whatever

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,880
it is you're building

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,320
may actually have great java dots and

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,839
maybe it's a library that people are

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
integrating and really all they need is

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,320
javadoc

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,680
maybe you don't need this like maybe

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,200
it's not you know just because it's

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,079
possible doesn't mean you have to have

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,800
it um maybe you may maybe your attention

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,400
improving javadocs or publishing javadoc

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,320
is time better spent

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,240
um if you have contributors with a

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,880
strong technical writing background who

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,200
actually

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,800
know like all of the official tools that

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,320
tech writers write and they're willing

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,040
to use them and maintain them and all

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
that stuff

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,240
then you know they may not this may feel

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,440
too simple for them

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,680
um and uh may not they may not enjoy it

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,720
um or if you have collaborators and like

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,839
you know who just

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,480
who can't who aren't technical enough

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,960
to learn some of the tools of you know

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,800
um

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,560
learn the build and jenkins and setting

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
up jenkins jobs and learning get you

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,599
know

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,079
get github and publication and html and

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,520
css um if that's uh um

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,119
if that's something that's that's not

00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,680
available to you then this this may not

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,760
work

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,440
either and honestly i think if you just

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
had one of these it still could probably

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,920
work

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,960
if you had a combination of these items

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,400
i think it would still be

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,640
it could be a challenge for you

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
so that's it um i'm actually pretty

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,560
close to done with time

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,960
um so thank you everybody um if uh you

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,400
have

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,760
if you if you're on a project that um

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,200
is thinking about would you if you'd

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,480
like to talk to me more about this feel

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,079
free to reach out to me

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,760
um if you're on project i would like to

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,640
go forward i can point you at all the

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,760
stuff

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,760
and um all the stuff we've done and uh

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,359
and the code we've written and you'd be

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,440
welcome obviously more than welcome to

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:51,119
uh to borrow any of it

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:51,119
