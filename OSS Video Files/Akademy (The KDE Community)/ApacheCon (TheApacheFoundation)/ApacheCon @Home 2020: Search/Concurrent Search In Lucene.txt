	Concurrent Search In Lucene
Atri Sharma

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Concurrent search is not a new feature in Lucene but has been unexplored. This talk will talk about the basics, benefits, when to use and when not to use and recent improvements in this area. Concurrent search can provide a massive gain for analytical queries, which are becoming more and more popular as data volumes grow. Single threaded queries do not take the complete advantage of available CPU resources -- something that concurrent query fixes. This talk will take audience through a complete know-hows and integrating with existing search platforms built using Lucene.
