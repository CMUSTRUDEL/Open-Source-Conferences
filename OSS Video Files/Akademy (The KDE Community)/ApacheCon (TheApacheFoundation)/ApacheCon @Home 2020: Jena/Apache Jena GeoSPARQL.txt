	Apache Jena GeoSPARQL

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

This presentation will discuss an implementation of GeoSPARQL for Apache Jena and a Fuseki integration. GeoSPARQL adds spatial functions to the SPARQL query language and enables the processing of spatial data with the popular Apache Jena project. In this presentation basic filter and property functions will be discussed in context of spatial relations and geometry shapes or types for the use with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL. Apache Jena GeoSPARQL spatial filters can be a applied to Well-known text (WKT) representation of geometry objects and datasets using the WGS84 Geo predicates for latitude and longitude. The goal for the latest release of Apache Jena GeoSPARQL module was to follow generally the 11-052r4 OGC GeoSPARQL standard where possible while providing an easy to use extension for Apache Jena users.
