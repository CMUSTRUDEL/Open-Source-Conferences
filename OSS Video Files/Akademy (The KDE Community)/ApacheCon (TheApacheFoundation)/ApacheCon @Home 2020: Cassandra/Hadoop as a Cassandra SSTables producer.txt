Description: 
	Hadoop as a Cassandra SSTables producer
Serban Teodorescu, Adelina Vidovici

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

We’re using a lambda architecture, with Hadoop used for the main database and Cassandra deployed as persistent cache at edges, in total about 7-800 Cassandra nodes. One issue is daily push of data from Hadoop to Cassandra, which is the main factor that impacts the clusters performance and costs. We used to produce JSON data in Hadoop, then convert it to SSTables at the edges and streaming them to Cassandra. I’ll show why this architecture is unable to take advantage of Cassandra 4 streaming improvements, why is that important for us, how to combine Hadoop with Cassandra vnodes in order to achieve optimal streaming, and show some (preliminary) performance figures. The later is work in progress, but I hope it will be finished by the time the conference is startin

I'm at SRE at Adobe, part of a small team that manages 30+ Cassandra clusters for Adobe Audience Manager. Previously, I was a Python programmer, and I'm still trying to find out how a software developer who preferred SQL databases ended up as an SRE for a Cassandra team, and then started to work in Java.
