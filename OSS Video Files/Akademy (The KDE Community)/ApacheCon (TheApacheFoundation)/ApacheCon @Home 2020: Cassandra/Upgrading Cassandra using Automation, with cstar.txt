	Upgrading Cassandra using Automation, with cstar

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

I recently did an upgrade of 200+ nodes of Cassandra across multiple environments sitting behind multiple applications using the cstar tool. We chose the cstar tool because, out of all automation options, it has topology awareness specifically to Cassandra. I will share my experience with this upgrade, including observations and surprises, as well as a walk-through of the process using a Cassandra cluster provisioned in Docker.

With experience as an open-source DBA and developer for software-as-a-service environments, Valerie has expertise in web-scale data storage and data delivery, including MySQL, Cassandra, Postgres, and MongoDB.
