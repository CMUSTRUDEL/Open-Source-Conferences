Building a database is hard. Building a distributed database is harder. Building a distributed database that the industry relies on is even harder. Our goal to build Apache Cassandra 4.0 is to make it rock solid. In this talk, we go behind the scenes to show you how the Apache Cassandra community is building and testing Apache Cassandra 4.0 so that it is the most stable release ever!
