Whether your storing timeseries data for a messaging app or device metadata for an industrial IoT application, your Cassandra data model can have a massive impact on your applicationâ€™s performance and scalability. In this talk, we will walk through advanced techniques and best practices for building highly scalable, fast, and robust data models. You will learn how to model your data based on your queries and access patterns to ensure you have well-distributed data that will enable your application to scale up as traffic grows. We will talk through examples of deformalizing data, modeling complex relationships, and optimizations that you can apply to your schemas and data models to improve performance.
