They say itâ€™s always hard the first time you do something. Is it really? In this talk we prove the opposite and give some guidance on how to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn and contribute for the first time to a project like Apache Cassandra. Contributions can happen in many forms, from documentation, testing and bug fixing to developing new cool features. Come, join us in our exciting adventure to Cassandra 4.0, the most stable release ever, and beyond to 5.0!

Cassandra contributor and distributed systems deva.
