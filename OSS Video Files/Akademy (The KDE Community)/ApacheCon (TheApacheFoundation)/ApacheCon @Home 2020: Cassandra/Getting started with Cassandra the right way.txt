	Getting started with Cassandra the right way
Erick Ramirez

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Cassandra users run into problems particularly when they're new to the technology. In this session, I'll talk about: - the common pitfalls so you don't fall into the trap; - top things users ask for help; - how to quickly diagnose issues; - where to get help.

I'm an Apache Cassandra enthusiast at DataStax. I've been educating and helping other users become successful with Cassandra for 7 years. I answer questions on various channels including ASF Slack and the users mailing list.
