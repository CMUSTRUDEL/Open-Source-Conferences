00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,840
first keynote speak of speech of the day

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,160
and uh i won't steal any more for time

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,559

all right uh hello everyone i hope you

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,440
can all hear me

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,879
and see me okay see my slides uh

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,079
this is my first time presenting to such

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,199
a large group

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,760
remotely uh and it's kind of a wild

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
experience i'm used to getting on stages

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
which is always

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
you know in front of big audiences which

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,320
is always scary this is somehow

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,080
scarier because i can't see any of you

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,680
and i have no idea if you're like

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
rolling your eyes at me chucking

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,720
tomatoes so anyway

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,920
i i hope this all goes okay i'm here in

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,040
new york city in my bedroom uh

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,439
office gym life room

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
uh these days during this fun pandemic

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
period of time

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
uh but i'm really thrilled to be here uh

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
able to talk to you all

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,920
at apachecon uh this talk is about

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,079
building engaged

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,880
communities so uh you know to begin

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,799
i like to start out by by using this

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,119
quote right in a time of drastic change

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
is the learners who inherit the future

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
um

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
and like the point of this quote i think

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
it's pretty obvious to uh

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
tech people right if you want to be able

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
to

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
you know stay relevant as things change

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
all around you you've got to keep

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,439
learning right you can't stay stuck in

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,439
your old ways i think that's

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,880
that's pretty well understood by

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,399
engineers um but

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,319
i think it's worth spending a minute

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,599
just really emphasizing

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,239
how much change there is and continues

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,200
to be

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,280
in the open source community alone so uh

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
back in 2008

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,959
some of you might have been doing open

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,920
source around then i was a little bit

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,599
um the biggest kind of active repository

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
for open source projects outside of the

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
big foundations

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
was sourceforge so maybe that's a blast

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,480
from the past for some of you

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
um and there were 18 000 active open

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,040
source projects in sourceforge back then

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
i think i forget how i found this

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,760
information but let's assume it's

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,920
relatively true

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,120
so uh when i was working on this talk i

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
looked up how many

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,760
public repositories there were in github

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,000
today and there are 41 million

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
now okay fine that's just public

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,959
repositories

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,319
if you look at public repositories with

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
at least five forks

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,640
so presumably if it's got five forks

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
probably some people are working on it

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,519
together

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
now you get to around one million and

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
again that's not all necessarily open

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,959
source software

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,560
but it is pretty astounding

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,599
how much change has happened to open

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,159
source and how

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,959
just how much massive adoption we've

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,000
seen

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,840
in open source in the past 10 10 plus

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,200
years um it really kind of blows my mind

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
uh how how different things have become

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,120
there

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,319
um so before i you know before i get

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
into what i'm going to talk about here i

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
guess i'll introduce myself

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
um so as i said my name is camille um

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,840
i'm currently the head of platform

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
engineering and a company called two

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
sigma which is a financial

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,560
company here in new york city um prior

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
to to sigma i worked i was the cto

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,799
of a startup called rent the runway

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
which many of you may or may not have

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
heard of uh

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,879
it is rents designer dresses and

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,760
accessories to women

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,920
prior to that i was an ic for a long

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,159
time an individual contributor um

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,920
i worked on a lot of big distributed

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,280
systems and actually i got

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,280
involved in open source uh back in

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,639
around you know 2010-ish

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,280
2009 kind of time frame uh and i am

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
still a committer and pmc member for the

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,320
apache zookeeper project

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
although i will admit that i should

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,479
probably give away those uh

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,000
those bits uh because i

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,479
uh you know i uh

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
haven't been doing a lot of contribution

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,120
lately

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
given all the other responsibilities in

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,639
my work but i'm very passionate about

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,320
open source i was on the

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
founding technical oversight committee

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,040
for the cloud native compute foundation

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
um i you know oversee a lot of open

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
source work

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,400
at my current company um i am hugely

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
passionate about

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
you know open source is just a critical

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
part of the tech ecosystem

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
and you know i think the apache

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
foundation is one of the one of the

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
greatest out there

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,919
um i also of course am a manager and

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,960
leader and i actually wrote a book

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,680
uh on on management and uh

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,039
no this book is actually not on uh

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
specifically on applying

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,800
engineering management leadership to

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
open source but it is still

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
probably relevant so to some people on

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
that

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,520
um and i wrote this book because i was

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,520
in between my time as the cto or the

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,120
runway and joining two sigma

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
um so i took about a year and a half off

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,600
to do various different things

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,840
uh and one of them was writing a book

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,720
and i wrote a book because

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
learning how to grow from you know an

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
individual contributor

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
someone who knew a lot about software um

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
and knew kind of how to run projects but

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,000
had never really led a team

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
to becoming a manager was really really

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,800
hard i had to learn a lot

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,360
i had to grow in a lot of ways what i

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
found

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,039
was that building a team is one of the

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
hardest things you can do

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,759
and i think building a community is also

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,759
one of the hardest things you can do

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
this is a picture of me with my going

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
away gift from

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
uh from rent the runway my nickname

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,600
rather runway uh

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,160
was uh the hammer um and so this is a

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,800
very large fitness hammer that has the

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,960
the phrase sisu on it which

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,560
maybe means something like with the help

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
of perseverance one manages through

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
impossible challenges

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
maybe um but you know i got the nickname

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,080
the hammer because

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,120
i came in uh to this leadership role at

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,880
rent the runway

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
and i thought that the way that you lead

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
people is you're

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
really technical and you know what to do

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
and you tell them what to do and you

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
come down hard on them when they do the

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
wrong thing

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
um and as you can probably imagine that

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,400
didn't go so well

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,199
uh so i had to pull myself out of that

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
hole

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,759
of uh of leadership in order to really

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,520
make my team successful

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
so i learned a lot of things in the

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
process um a lot of things that i think

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
apply not only to building

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,479
successful teams at companies but to

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,240
building successful

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,240
communities and projects um and so

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,840
i'm going to share with you a few ideas

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
on what we think engineers want right

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,000
what do i think they want i think they

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,000
want rewards i think they want

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,199
you know to see the value of their

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
contribution

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,960
i think they want respect uh i think

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
they

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,479
want you know to you know

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
get some stickiness of commitment and

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,960
finally i think

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,199
they seek purpose right they want to

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,240
have a feeling of ownership and yes you

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,880
will notice

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
these uh this terminology does in fact

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
follow

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,120
follow the apache terminology a little

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,319
bit right you start as a contributor you

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
become a committer and then maybe

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
someday

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,800
you become a project owner overseer

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,160
right

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
so let's dive in

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,240
rewards contribution

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
what gets people in the door of a

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
project what gets people

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
to contribute in the first place well

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
look

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
let's be honest with ourselves economics

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,160
is a big part of it right

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,599
uh rich just mentioned that he has a day

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,840
job he works for red hat

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
right a lot of us get involved in

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,199
projects because we need to do them for

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
our day jobs that's how i got involved

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
in apache zookeeper i was building

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,400
a big system that relied on zookeeper

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
there were some problems

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,199
that uh you know some bugs that i needed

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
you know to get fixed so i could do my

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
job so i got involved and that's how i

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
became

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,840
a contributor right i had an economic

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
incentive which was doing a good job at

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,800
the job that i'm getting paid to do

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,760
um for other projects people get

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,360
involved maybe

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,959
because not because they need it you

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
know for their current job but because

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,039
they want to get a new job

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,519
that uses this cool new technology right

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
um

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,040
we sometimes have this kind of you know

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,839
no true scotsman idea

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,839
in tech that open source that like oh

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,080
only people who are just genuinely

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
intellectually interested in a project

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,160
can valuably

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,600
contribute but look the truth is that a

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,880
lot of us work on open source and

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
contributed open source

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
because we think we're going to get

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,800
something out of it right the same way

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,320
that we choose our jobs because

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
you know at least partly we think we're

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
going to get paid well right

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
um of course there's more to it than

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,279
that right

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,959
um you know one of the

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,720
things that gets people contributing and

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,480
keeps them contributing

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
is that they feel like they're actually

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
able to do so

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,320
productively without too much pain um

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
i want to remind all of you who are you

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
know active

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,720
you know contributors or committers or

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
owners of projects

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
remember back to the very first time you

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
had a patch accepted

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,800
and how good it felt i remember it was

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,800
like super exciting

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,200
just you know like oh my gosh i'm a i'm

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,680
an apache contributor now that's great

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
um and even more remember how exciting

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,600
it was

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,399
when the change that actually had your

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,320
patch in it

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,000
actually went out and now your name is

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,080
on the contributor list right

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,440
um those feelings are great right people

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,360
love to feel like they have

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
not only done something but they've

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,760
actually done something that has

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,560
now shown value to the world it feels

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,680
amazing when that happens um

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,440
unfortunately

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
it can be really hard to get that

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
feeling um

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
in projects for various reasons when i

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
was at

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,839
uh rent the runway one of the best early

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,720
things that i did

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,399
to kind of improve the team and and help

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
everybody just you know be more engaged

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,480
at work

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
was that we had gotten ourselves into

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
this situation where

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,600
we've kind of over engineered part of

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
our

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,240
of our website and that meant that it

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,040
was really really hard

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,959
to uh ship features so anytime you

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
wanted to do a release it was like a

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,120
ton of manual work it was very

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,079
error-prone um we just kind of made a

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
mess

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,920
and so i supported the team in

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
saying okay like we're gonna take some

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
time

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
and fix this put in some automation

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,519
simplify some of this design

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
and make it so that we can release much

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
more easily and then actually push them

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
to say okay we need to be able to

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
release once a day now

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
those of you who are in the you know

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,000
continuous delivery world or whatever

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
may think

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
once a day who cares but look once a day

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,640
is way better than

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,399
once every two weeks or once a month uh

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
with days and days of work to get

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
something ready right so this was a big

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,160
improvement

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,519
so we did the work um team turned it on

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,800
and it was amazing

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,880
how much this improved the

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
engagement and motivation of the

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
engineering team

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,800
this simple change of making it easy for

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,399
people to get changes out the door

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,680
uh was a massive morale boost to

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
everyone on the team

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
i recently uh had this situation happen

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
again

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,639
um and did this turn around with a team

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,480
again and i will never forget that

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
you know before we did the turnaround

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
one of the engineers described the team

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,240
as feeling constipated

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,920
uh i i bet all of you have had that

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,680
experience with your price or it's just

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
everything's a little stopped up you

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,279
can't really get stuff

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
out right you can't get things done and

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,079
it's not like

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,440
the most miserable situation you've ever

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,560
been in your career

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,839
but it's not fun right you miss

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,040
that hit of feeling like you're able to

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,720
ship you're able to get things done

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,000
you're able to learn

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,000
now i realize that

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
you know open source projects are never

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,079
going to be able to ship

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
so frequently because look you've got

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,200
users like me i consume a lot of open

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
source projects and it would be really

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,880
annoying

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
if we had to like reingest and verify

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
and

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
all of that you know open source

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,560
projects every single day

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,120
but anything that we can do to make it

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
easier

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,760
for people to get those contributions in

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,600
in the most painless way possible

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,519
anywhere we can reevaluate

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
where have we added unnecessary

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,079
bureaucracy or

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,279
overhead to our project i think is

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,600
valuable for us to look at right

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,440
because sometimes you know that

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,639
bureaucracy may have been necessary a

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
number of years ago

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,760
but now there is improvements in

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
automation

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
that we can apply to a problem to make

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,920
things go faster and people

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
want to be able to get things done right

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
if you are a manager

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
one of the best things that you can do

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,519
for your team is make it so that they

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,920
get to say yes to

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
the question do i get to do what i do

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
best every day

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,560
right people want to do what they do

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
best every day for engineers that is

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,040
ship for engineers that is write code

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,040
and get things done

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,560
so that's all good right um but

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
once you've gotten people contributing

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,560
some of them you want to actually move

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,760
forward a little bit more engagement

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,040
into that commitment

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,480
and what gets us committed uh i think

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
that one of the biggest things about

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
that leads to commitment is actually

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,480
like a feeling of respect

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,720
and and sort of deeper community

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,680
engagement with a project

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,240
so there's this very uh uh popular

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
concept

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,240
in engineering management these days

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
called psychological safety or safety

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
right what does that mean it means that

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
when you feel

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
safe in a group you feel like you're

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,320
able to make mistakes

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,320
you feel like you're able to ask

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
questions stupid questions sometimes

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,519
you feel like you're able to be

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
vulnerable in front of the team

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,040
and that people aren't going to mock you

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,399
or think you're stupid

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,320
or disrespect you for you know

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
occasionally screwing up or saying

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
something dumb right

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,680
um now this is actually a really

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
important thing

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,880
for successful teams you do not have to

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
take my word for it

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,800
um this actually came out of a bunch of

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,600
research that google did

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,199
a few years ago and look it's google so

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
they have all these teams they love to

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,920
do research which is awesome

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,360
um they did this research where

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,959
they were like all right well what makes

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,639
our some teams perform better than

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,480
others remember this is google

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,839
all of these people you know have been

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
highly vetted they

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,880
do you know they have very intense

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
interview process right

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,160
um they are all well paid they're all

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,160
working on pretty interesting stuff

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,000
right they've got all of their basic

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
needs met and yet some teams do better

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,199
than others

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,320
what differentiates those teams well one

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,680
of the baseline things that

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
differentiates those teams

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,160
is that the best teams have that sense

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
of psychological safety

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,519
so how do you get this psychological

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,959
safety thing happening

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,120
um i think a lot of it comes from

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,000
a sense of relatedness right where when

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,160
you feel

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
friendly with people right when you feel

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,160
kind of a kinship

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,959
a community a sense of friendliness with

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,000
people

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,519
um you know that relatedness

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
uh helps to create this psychological

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,199
safety

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,839
um and you know this is

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,199
this is often in startups and in the

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
past in teams

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,880
people get this by kind of just having

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
teams that are all fairly homogenous

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
right

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
um if you look at big companies or tech

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,079
companies or startups

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,360
you see that you know in their early

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
days they hire

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,720
you know people who all went to the same

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,800
kind of school or who all worked

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
for the same prior companies in worst

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,759
cases people who all kind of look alike

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,959
right people who have strong cultural

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,360
things in common

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,120
that helps them sort of shortcut this

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
community building right well we all

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
you know we all know the same jokes

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
about that professor from sophomore year

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,120
because we all went to mit

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,920
together or whatever right um

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
unfortunately this is not a great

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,720
approach

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,079
if you want diversity on your team it

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,680
just doesn't work very well

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,480
um and more than that if you look at

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
the world of open source uh we cannot

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
rely

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,320
on everybody having the same background

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,079
right this is supposed to be an open

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,839
contribution process and in fact

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,759
what github has seen when they've done a

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,880
bunch of research on how open source is

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
changing right they do some great

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,440
research and publish it every

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
year one of the biggest things they've

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,560
noticed is the massive global growth

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,680
in contribution to open source right so

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,519
maybe in the past

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,880
a lot of us could get a buy with well

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,519
most of the people working on these

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,839
projects

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
are from north america or from the uk or

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
from europe

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
that is not no longer the case right we

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,079
have massive contributions

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
from all over the world from you know

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
india and china and everywhere which is

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,439
awesome

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,959
right this is great but this means that

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,199
creating these

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,400
strong communities that are sort of

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,799
friendly

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
and and have good working relationships

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,520
takes more work

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,600
now as a leader uh i even with people

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,559
who i saw every day in person

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,000
i had to do a lot of work to improve my

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,919
relatedness skills

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,160
um and one of the things that i had to

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,320
kind of remember and remind myself of

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,600
is that empathy is a learnable skill

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,360
um so this image is from a kids show

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,160
here in the united states called daniel

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
tiger

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
if you've heard of mr rogers

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,799
neighborhood it's kind of from that

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,080
that creative branch right um

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:01,039
and kids shows so i have two two

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,760
young kids um kids shows you know a lot

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,120
of what they focus on is teaching kids

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,080
how to feel other how to see that other

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,679
people are humans

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,039
right uh oh yes like that person is hurt

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,760
when you do this thing or

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,480
this is how you share this is how you

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
respect

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,760
that there are other people in this

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,440
world with their own feelings their own

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,440
desires their own needs

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,480
and how you show that you care about

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
them and how you you know sort of

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
develop

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,600
functional relationships with them right

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,240
this is a learnable skill this is

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,720
something

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,080
that we can all work on that you can be

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,600
better at or worse at

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,840
but it is not something that you're just

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,919
born with and therefore if you aren't

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,720
born with it you don't know how to do it

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,080
i am not the most empathetic person in

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,280
the world right it is not

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,720
actually um a natural skill for me i

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,400
tend to be very much

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,000
down to business let's think about

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,280
problems let's talk about problems let's

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
analyze things

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,880
and one of the things that i had to

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,000
learn in creating better teams

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,640
in the workplace was how to

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,600
slow down and ask people a little bit

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
about themselves

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
ask them about you know their marathons

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,240
or their dogs right you don't have to

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
pry

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,919
deeply into people's social lives but

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
taking the time to get to know people as

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,120
people a little bit um and taking the

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,400
time to remember that they

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,080
are people is so important i have to

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
admit that you know as an open source

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,000
contributor i have not always

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
done a very good job of creating

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
psychologically safe communities in the

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,760
past right

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
i had that you know sharp elbows strong

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,240
opinions

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,280
um judgmental engineer thing and i've

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,200
had to

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
learn how to move past that to

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,160
appreciate people's contributions in

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,320
different ways

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,240
um and and to realize that i'm going to

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,280
get better results out of a team or out

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,320
of the community

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,679
if i'm more welcoming um and and able to

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,840
appreciate the different perspectives

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,840
that people are bringing to the table

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
to go one step further if we want to

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
build successful

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,799
open source communities it's not just

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,200
about engineers anymore right

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,320
um you know the most successful open

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,240
source projects

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,400
need huge teams of people with all kinds

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,159
of different skills i love the

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
you know the t-shirt for this conference

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,640
i'm not wearing it but you know look

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,360
you need people who can draw cool things

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
to make

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,280
cool you know logos or t-shirts for your

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,960
conferences you need people who are good

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
at writing so that you have great

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,000
documentation because

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,520
god knows one of the hardest parts of

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,919
getting started with a new project

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,760
is figuring out how to use it and often

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,640
the documentation is just not where it

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,159
needs to be

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,760
you need people that are going to get up

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,600
on stage at conferences like this

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,000
and evangelize the project and get

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,760
people involved and excited about

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,520
you know working on it right it is

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,919
important for us if we want to build

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,880
effective teams and communities to go

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,679
beyond

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,559
just the skills of an engineer to

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,640
appreciate

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,840
all of the skills that we need in order

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,760
to make our teams

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,760
companies or communities successful

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
okay so we've gotten people even more

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
engaged

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
now how do we get them to sort of that

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,000
that ownership stage that feeling of

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,840
ownership

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,320
and my experience is uh that we really

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
need

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
a sense of purpose we need to develop a

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
sense of purpose how do you do that what

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,679
does that really

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,679
mean all right so like a lot of

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,360
management literature and leadership

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,679
literature is all about the why

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
right how are you explaining the why to

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,080
people

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,080
why does this company exist why does

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,039
this project exist why does this team

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
exist

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,960
um we don't always do a great job of

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,320
that in open source projects actually

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,400
it's it's interesting

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
you know my experience is that open

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,520
source projects that have grown

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
organically out of something that

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,600
someone built inside of a company

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,520
because they had a need

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
the why there tends to be a lot clearer

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
you sort of understand oh they built

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
this because they really had this

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,240
problem

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,600
and then they saw that other people

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,799
might also have this problem and so sort

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,039
of generalized

00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:00,320
um but it certainly uh works

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,919
well uh for open source projects right a

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,080
little bit better than sometimes i think

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
people you know think there should be a

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
need filled with open source and try to

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,880
build an open source project around it

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
those projects may or may not work as

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,320
well because the why

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
they're founding why is not always as

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,799
clear

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
but as a leader right you want to know

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,679
why a project exists you want to be able

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,760
to kind of explain it but

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,360
more than that you want to help people

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
understand the point of what they're

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,960
doing

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,760
right now um and

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,159
this is a piece of work that you can

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,799
never do enough of as a manager

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,400
um and that we often don't do enough of

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,679
even in the open source community right

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,960
so if you want to get owners first of

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,159
all look there's lots of things that can

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
happen with your project right there's

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,039
lots of bugs that could be fixed there's

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
lots of features that could be added

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,880
we all have to make decisions about

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,120
where to spend time and

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
a lot of people a lot of contributors

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,159
and committers

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,159
want to do what's most important for the

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,880
project but they don't necessarily

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,320
have the clear idea of what that is when

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,039
you as a leader

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,120
spend the time helping to explain why

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,679
you would prioritize fixing one bug over

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,280
the other

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,039
why would you why you would prioritize

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,360
building out certain kinds of features

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,080
or not building other kinds of features

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,520
you are starting to explain to people

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,080
the values and judgments um

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,480
and conditions that you use for making

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,080
decisions when you explain to people

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,840
what the point of what they're doing

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,120
right now is

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,039
they can start to understand how those

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,039
decisions are actually made like what's

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,039
really foundationally important in a

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,799
very tangible way right it's much easier

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,400
to understand than having just some set

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,679
of values written on the wall or written

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,640
on a readme for a project

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,320
of course here's what happens next once

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,760
people start to understand

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,279
the why of what they're doing right now

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
and they're really engaged and they're

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,679
really into your project

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,360
and they're showing the kind of

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
ownership that you want to see right or

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,120
they're fixing bugs without being told

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,080
to and they're going the extra mile

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,120
for the community they're going to want

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,200
to understand how

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,559
we decide where we're going next and

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,840
they're going to want to become part of

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,240
that process

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,279
and oftentimes leaders fall down here we

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,840
want people

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,640
to you know go the extra mile and get

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,080
things done

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,919
and you know you know show the users

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,440
that like this project is like really

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,320
going places but we don't actually want

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,159
them to let

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,760
we don't want to let them make decisions

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
by themselves and we actually want to

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,120
really

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520
give them uh you know that ownership and

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,799
that

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,159
is a problem that causes our projects

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,240
to struggle right you cannot scale

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,799
if you are not willing to give away your

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,320
legos so there's a great blog post by a

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,080
woman named molly graham called giving

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
away your legos you can google it

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
um and it's about leadership and

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,960
startups but i think it applies very

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,440
well to any kind of leadership

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,880
you know as you're building something

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
right you're building a cool lego

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
structure with your friends right

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,919
um if you want to build something really

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,840
big really fast

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,120
you can't dictate where every single

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,279
brick goes you can't

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,320
hoard all the legos yourselves you have

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,159
to share them

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,840
with the people around you so that they

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,919
can contribute their own piece

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,600
of the structure when i was at rent the

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,159
runway one of the best things that we

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,640
did

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,080
for really taking engagement of the team

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
to the next level

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,919
was that the executive team worked very

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
hard to think about what the high level

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,480
business goals should be where should we

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,080
be focusing our time

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,440
from a strategic sense and what were

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,559
some of the metrics that really made

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,000
sense there

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,480
but then we gave those goals to

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,600
cross-functional teams um and said all

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
right guys

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,360
tell us what we should build to get

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,760
there right you now

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,600
have this sort of high-level direction

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,039
but we can't tell you every single

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,559
project that should be built

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,240
to get this team to the next level we

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,600
can't scale it an executive team can't

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,960
be telling everybody every single little

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,440
thing they need to do

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320
um that just doesn't work right uh and

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,200
so we

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,640
gave them you know the high level vision

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,640
and the high level goals

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,760
they actually came up with what the work

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,279
would be to

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,840
achieve those goals and that led them to

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,720
feel

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,919
significantly more ownership and purpose

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,279
over the outcomes

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,720
than they would have felt if we just

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,480
told them exactly what to do right and

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,960
this is the goal you want people

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,360
to not only feel ownership over the

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,159
outcomes you want you need to give them

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,120
some incentive and some actual you know

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,559
autonomy

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,200
into how they're going to achieve those

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:28,080
outcomes if that's what you want to say

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,720
all right so all these different things

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,120
right they

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,919
have interacting effects it does it's

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,760
not like a

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,919
ladder right it's not just that like oh

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,000
somebody you know sees some reward from

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,000
something so they kind of get

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,200
involved a little bit and then they like

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
the community so they get involved a

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,679
little bit more

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,760
and then they feel like they really have

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,120
some ownership over the project so

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,480
now they're at their highest level of

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,919
commitment and you don't really need to

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,640
worry about the other things

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,000
right i have seen plenty of people who

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,080
were very committed

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,600
leave projects because it was just too

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,640
hard to get things done it was just too

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,360
bureaucratic

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
it just the cycle time was too long and

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
they had too many other things going on

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,360
in their lives i think that's

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,799
very common and sometimes that's the

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,840
right thing but sometimes that's a loss

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,320
right

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
i've seen people who felt significant

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,279
ownership and had done amazing things

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,520
for projects

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,559
uh leave because they felt that the

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,640
community

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,600
was not a safe and welcoming place for

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,520
them um and that is always a sad thing

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
to see right and when when somebody who

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,799
has

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
really given a lot um you know to a

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,919
community

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,120
feels you know bullied and ostracized

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,679
that can be

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,520
you know that's that's not a place that

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,279
i think any of us wants our open source

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,799
communities to go to right

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,480
obviously this is all very fraught in

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,960
the modern world but

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,000
you know making welcoming communities is

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
so important

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,080
um even for our owners right even even

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,159
owners even people that feel

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,640
a huge amount of you know purpose and

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,559
community ownership

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,720
need that all right so to summarize

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,840
the fire the three factors of engagement

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,080
or rewards

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,760
economic rewards status right working on

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,399
a cool open source project is a nice

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,880
thing

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,240
employers love that uh but more than

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
that people think like to get things

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
done so that they can learn

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,679
and grow and just feel accomplishment

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,200
engineers like to ship

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,159
never ever forget that uh respect

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,919
safety and relatedness and community and

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,919
partnership that goes beyond

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,360
just people that are exactly like you

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,799
you know never forget

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,760
those people that you're communicating

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:33,360
with via email or slack or pull request

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,960
those are humans right and if it's worth

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,880
it to slow down

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,600
and choose your words carefully and be

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,120
kind if you want to create

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,760
a healthy and engaged community

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,360
and finally of course purpose right why

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
why does this thing exist at all why am

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,039
i working on this thing

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,720
and now how do i become part of the

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,320
decision making process right

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,080
you've got to give away your legos

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,240
owners you've got to be willing

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,000
to let people make decisions that may

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,480
not be exactly the decision that you

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,480
would make

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,720
so as i said in the time of drastic

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,360
change it is the learners who inherit

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,760
the future

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,720
and tech is all about change right this

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,399
is what

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,760
you know a five megabyte hard drive

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,600
looked like in 1956

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,120
it's kind of kind of crazy to think

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,840
right we're three generations out from

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,960
this

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,799
photo and things have changed and they

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,840
just keep changing and keep changing and

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,399
keep changing

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,480
and so it's up to all of us to stay

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,200
open-minded and keep learning

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,799
and keep questioning was this approach

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,480
that worked five years ago

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,080
is this still the right approach for

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,000
this project for this foundation for

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,320
this community

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,360
and of course one way to keep learning

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,679
is to read

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,880
you can read my book uh the manager's

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,919
path is my

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,840
is my my main book on all the stages of

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,919
engineering management i also wrote

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,360
i also edited a book called 97 things

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,799
every engineering manager should know

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,320
for those of you who are

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,080
engineering managers you might enjoy

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,840
that uh if you would like

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,440
to talk to me you can try tweeting at me

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,120
i occasionally write on my blog and

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
you can try emailing me camila

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,559
apache.org i will admit that i do not

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,039
always uh answer email well

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,000
so it's a little bit roll the dice uh

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,559

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,720

enjoyed this talk and have a great rest

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,760
of your day i was reflecting while you

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,679
spoke one of the things that's so great

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,720
about today as compared to all those

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,240
years ago

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,840
is when we were just kind of making

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,600
stuff up as we went along

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,279
and now there's all this expertise and

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,520
research around this topic so

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,200
it's really great to hear from you and

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,559
thank you thank you so much for that
