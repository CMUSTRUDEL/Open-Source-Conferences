Title: Ludwig Nussel - Overview of openSUSE's Distributions - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	The best operating system for the best desktop environment ;)

Some years the openSUSE project split it's distribution and changed
the development process to accomodate different target audiences.
Tumbleweed, the rolling release and Leap, a more classic, stable
distribution. In contrast to most competitors both distributions
integrate both KDE and GNOME into the same code base, offering both
at install time.

This talk aims to explain the intentions, schedules and target audiences of
both distributions, resulting in different requirements and expections for the desktop enviroments.

Thanks yeah introduce that I'm loopy and

00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,830
the reason I focus of the deep okay

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,960
paper then I look for something quite

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:27,050
some time actually so why am I here

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,349
well we've been around for more than 25

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,949
years now and the reference among you

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,780
totally notion of former times if banana

00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:38,900
lady distribution right from the start

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:43,360
and for a long time okay he was actually

00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:47,360
revolting and Susan doctor developers

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:51,460
the tax change at some point he decided

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:56,690
to go for home to default for later but

00:00:51,460 --> 00:01:06,110
no this may be it always kept this place

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:11,330
and Susie in something also changed over

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:16,490
time so we have this perfectly back then

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:19,039
every year that model change so long

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,679
have two distributions now I'm here to

00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:23,679
tell you both that we have now our

00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:30,410
community so we have to know one of them

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,569
is tumbleweed they're willing to lease

00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,660
the solution and the other one asleep

00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:37,179
that's what I'm responsible for Theresa

00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,950
staining solution

00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:42,830
so Tom believe being a only difficulty

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:47,080
is the latest and greatest of everything

00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:50,149
of course you get new versions every day

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,700
but that's normal for anyone in the

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:55,489
distribution I would say so what's the

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,830
cool thing that well we have kind of a

00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:00,560
CIO operating system so we're not just

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,989
talking universes of packages on our

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
users but that's actually our automated

00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:09,319
game system in both there that make sure

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,610
that there's always some base quality HD

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:17,349
story system never breaks yeah Tom

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,349
moving at around $50

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:27,800
on the other side directly the stable

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,350
release distribution based on server

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,640
sources

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:37,370
normally the romanians updates will

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:39,500
doesn't change much between the years

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,190
more features overall if you follow all

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,440
the other specs you get more than three

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,250
years of maintenance in total so the

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,160
Congolese point when we just extended

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,670
with the maintenance so we are at forty

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,580
four effectively actually from the start

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:02,360
and leave has opposed to our thousand

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:09,950
users in total we have even more so

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:13,459
there's a long tail of okay so based on

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,430
those facts both decisions are obviously

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,590
for different target audiences yesterday

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,780
somewhere this one is better on we don't

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:25,880
eat well because they very different

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:30,530
user groups families I think the ladies

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:33,650
stuff is for developers or contributors

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,230
of about three because we very close

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,799
there and of course no powers such as

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:43,850
Lena started a different other side

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,850
being on conservative is suitable for

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,160
production use its effective software

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,310
and other vendors actually for some of

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:57,040
these little cars to put on their

00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:02,180
systems dissipates users users of course

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,200
we also have totally target users but

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,200
also the toilet

00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:15,860
they target people users so let's talk

00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:18,170
about because those are the newest

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,750
operating systems they are general

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:29,060
purpose so we are not doing

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:31,640
openSUSE for specific our general scales

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,820
from the small recipe prior to data

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,330
fitness basically many more like that

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,860
based on our care package manager for

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,660
better or worse never change that

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,650
technology but that doesn't mean it's

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,410
bad actually

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,590
packaging policies there so we don't

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,650
just take a shower put it out there but

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,630
we have our basic policy - exactly so

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,120
fishes are split up in smaller chunks

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,720
we've actually put very smaller systems

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,520
or systems that contain elevated

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,520
organization and development files all

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,860
that is possible without them

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,810
what's also worth noting is open schools

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,410
a self-hosted a reproducible that means

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,510
everything is here

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,190
no to the build service ice office is

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:23,900
actually used to put off instance it has

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,940
no external components but the romantic

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,410
we used to put the package is there but

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:34,130
everything in there was used to put

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:36,830
themselves to see for example all of the

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,560
resource based some distributions

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,710
developers upload final packages for

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,480
example of the case for us and all the

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,910
weather conferences the package that

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:52,910
always has to automotive sources then

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:55,250
for the submit request to request those

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,800
requests are reviewed the source review

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,490
of automated tools as well as human

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,010
video and only for reuse part of the get

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:09,730
into the main level and and people are

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,730
satisfied the process is open anymore

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,930
and I said it's a fully rolling

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,419
distribution that means Tommy doesn't

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,060
just update some components of a

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,700
greatest pain

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,390
oh no that's not the case don't we

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:29,170
always update everything no exceptions

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:32,140
all the 11000 sauce pictures it has get

00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:36,450
up there on its per day all integrated

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:39,520
together every day and this is enormous

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:43,120
power behind that what we changed every

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,640
day and to make sure that it break we

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,460
have those old many tastes using open

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:59,050
carry I was surprised to hear both

00:08:48,460 --> 00:09:01,270
already today we'll talk about more so

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:05,080
that those are many tastes make sure

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:08,260
that the system always comes up into

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,240
some defined state so we know dependence

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,000
we know the good other words we know

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,580
that sister Dee didn't break the system

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,490
somehow we know that X can start a

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,200
theory you know that KDE can log in your

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,740
user you know that you can start by us

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,810
installation for you most likely some

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,750
other issues on both issue but we always

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:38,200
use internal words and whatever happens

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:41,890
you normally always fix your stuff to

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:49,120
the face for you we can do roll back so

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:51,310
what's the distributions is the farthest

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:57,910
apart so whenever you install a package

00:09:51,310 --> 00:10:01,860
or you institution upgrade with a trophy

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,860
system then it's called a

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,960
insulation face for no reason or your

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,380
system fresh after can you snap a

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:15,670
rollback we do you take on the old stage

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:21,810
and or recover from the skipper snapshot

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:23,960
it's pretty quick yeah tumbleweed is

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,900
available for x86 and

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,980
66 before aspiring architectures and

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:34,220
there was a request arm here 6450 64 and

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,620
it's been 90 those are all this much

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,570
tested and may be there because come

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,450
with the page for an expert in sacrifice

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,030
so they already testing ahead of time

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,190
what's coming up there but also make

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,620
from the part of interesting because you

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,100
can both see what's coming there in the

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,960
world and you can also influence it so

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,800
if you put stuff at Tom Louise there's

00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:02,740
no chance that it just blows into the

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,390
future and what does that mean for heyy

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:14,630
yeah you guys always the latest business

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:17,360
technology from we have obviously is

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,810
environment the release associate pretty

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,660
quickly

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:25,670
clearly the next day of the release - so

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,010
Tom mood is really great for cool new

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:31,760
stuff its users are looking for that new

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,830
stuff they want that and if the issues

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,020
they can would be fixed quickly because

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,790
developers instant system so we're

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:43,880
something twice as big as possible

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:48,350
volley the fix the video next day and as

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,980
I said III probably this is our faith

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,140
and our use case and always both eggs to

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,950
go fish mattress and then get the fix

00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,250
for the next one okay so much for the

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,260
phone with let's talk about it this is

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,560
the same one the base system there is

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,020
from Sicilian enterprise or the spaces

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,390
to me that is basically anything up to

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:17,800
normal so the carnage from the system

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:21,070
see see see see ex ante non environment

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:24,100
including cute because I study used for

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,680
us all the rest that also means a

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,040
tear-stained from Tommy we'd at the time

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,330
release so he could not keep getting

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,300
updates from Tommy we know those

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:41,770
components but basically there we stay

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:46,870
and stay that makes away and then you

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:51,370
can mess up this is a release of other

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:54,070
surprises the users over time they're

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:58,960
using minor versions kind of specular

00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:05,340
updates and survivors for x86 64 with

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:10,120
both to air so that's also something

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:12,070
again minor versions are specular

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,350
upgrades so they may need to do some

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:23,380
features of them are completely based on

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:26,980
Tom coming from 3 the current version

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:31,660
Peggy's a bigger room so right now we

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:35,170
release 15 0 15 next year small bunch of

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,960
conservation system get into little 0 1

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,380
and then next one the tools probably a

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,740
bigger one that has more features but

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,820
even if those aspects add new features

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,970
they conditional resistor they're

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,890
painted updates so we want our users to

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,530
follow the service space or we need to

00:13:50,890 --> 00:14:05,500
do that easily

00:13:52,530 --> 00:14:05,950
so what does the new for Bailey less is

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,160
more

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:11,200
so you rather have one or two really

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,490
cool features that are really stable

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,000
mature and work for the users there's

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,000
Chinese

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,970
to keep in mind that we can't have

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,760
redundant components so if you think

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:31,120
very let's just put it this you know -

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,940
audio for example look Thomas to you but

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,270
actually those 11,000 sauce packages and

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:41,770
also you get that money

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:44,050
so we have to integrate all of that so

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,360
there are compromises and he will be

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,570
operate all those he's checked it which

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,450
is also a part that we don't normally

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:58,330
you don't have the resources the default

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:59,800
is to be conservative but as I said some

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,610
updates are possible in two years so

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:07,420
because I respect there's also a chance

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:10,090
to use new features in 1212 and that

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:16,300
would be 42 got very keen for something

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:19,570
- what else I wanted to mention

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,840
translations so developers tend to not

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,370
see color languages so I could see

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,740
myself have a look at the screen it's a

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,470
neutral German High I don't see the

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,870
difference nominee always like I'm gonna

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,970
pay for it but first stable release it's

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,490
important there are users that of that

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:43,350
family relation we need two translations

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,350
there for developers effective

00:15:51,700 --> 00:16:00,140
pollution is the benefit for that I

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:03,740
would say yeah so let's talk about what

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:06,280
we have right now well now we go to the

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:31,400
maintenance bonus for 3 was released

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:33,070
last year and it has and speaking of

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:53,900
that I don't even know what kind of

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:57,520
applications or damages yes but there's

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,520
only the user visible parts of it

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:05,090
there's a special story about all of

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:11,000
that so that'll be about that nothing of

00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:14,180
this talking yeah deep makes even have

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,320
51 most likely around the same time as

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,320
this one

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,960
so maybe may I don't expect major

00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,570
changes if though I talked about it much

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:28,340
so I would say also the same experiment

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:31,250
as before and after that you know

00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:36,770
complete about 50 to whatever it is 1920

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:41,390
and since the Parramatta so respect I

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:44,080
guess to Julian's Enterprise base we'll

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,080
do some hoppers

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,249
we'll be working on the trauma system DX

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,820
and maybe also cute how do you all know

00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:58,490
yet

00:17:49,820 --> 00:18:01,039
the good thing is if you sta even eaten

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,200
your food version then let's talk about

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,549
that in advance we can call it with the

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,259
three guys on the other side if I get to

00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:12,019
knowledge D plans are going to cost you

00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:16,700
and let you know what's coming so we

00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:18,470
also know if they're going in any case

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,649
by default

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:30,499
I would prefer less changes so I

00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:32,720
wouldn't actually operate because it's

00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:34,549
just less surprising to users always

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,499
keep in mind that there were many costs

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:40,789
attached to operating a desktop

00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:43,840
environments or version is confused

00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,840
because my can changed

00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:49,429
one more thing the package shop not

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:53,480
really open to the distribution but this

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,159
is the community packages for students

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,519
enterprise so that is the bridge into

00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,860
the enterprise world with 50 they're

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,149
very closely aligned so on the same

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:08,990
various uses the same page sv we can

00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:12,440
offer the many packages from lead 40 so

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:16,519
that is how you get into 3d again

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:21,409
so those who ask nobody for the first no

00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:25,460
doesn't support any interest of gold

00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:28,220
which be enabled the package for channel

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:37,360
and get paid either so someone else to

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:42,409
support any he wants me to go the cycle

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:45,200
Enterprise the package shop yeah

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,380
to summarize we have offerings for both

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,390
developers and

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,700
production use it's a friendly

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,380
environment we actually like KDE

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,289
there's the lots of friends and Susie

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,360
that like Haiti Reforma

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:00,990
Kenny contributors are still continuing

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,880
to KDE there are many many at least and

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,059
some surroundings KDE actually this part

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,070
at the front default and the basis the

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:10,740
respect by the company both of

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,720
tumbleweed as well as indeed has a big

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,549
chance because there's always an

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,030
interesting at that feast and not just

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,750
when I gotta go away in some wedding so

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,690
this very often

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,650
25 since 35 years and I hope it will

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,520
last another 25 years old we get to stay

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,520
so it's May

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,529
[Applause]

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:52,140
I need any fuel boats obviously the

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,440
derivatives that exist outside of

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,750
Princeton stockholders hire or not that

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,670
one but my recommendation would always

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,130
be to get as much as possible

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,880
demanda solution because only that way

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,110
it's a radar I mean seriously

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,780
for example few years ago I talked with

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,090
the package of new health he was

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,130
complaining that it breaks whatever

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,440
release he has to take care of adjusting

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,960
it and that we just happened to get the

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,580
packages into distribution that way they

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,930
stay up there right now release

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,020
management we know if there's some

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,110
update oh and also rubygem we know that

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:33,190
whoever talk to break my example know it

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:35,170
was boot test so that way we can notify

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,830
in advance and people will help them

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,670
actually to fix the package at the price

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:45,040
so if you do some lettuce and spinach I

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:48,120
recommend always get your changes into

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,120
the bank distribution and

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:37,150
the party I would say so they're okay

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,850
[Music]

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:44,780
live images based on the very purpose of

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:47,990
Katie and those ones arrested by ETA and

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,080
there is also what makes a east wind wet

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,870
because okay packages the latest KDE

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,160
gets a test about Mikhail reading so by

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,860
the time that they understand release

00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,440
and going to Tom bitterly were only

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,830
tested it the invasion is most likely

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,420
cause it's very quickly going that but

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,160
that is kind of special to Kennedy

00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,430
because they really put effort there to

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:14,020
develop the testing framework in channel

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,020
obviously people do not have this

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,179
thank you good soldier they want to

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:34,990
update and does the next up will start

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,990
