Description: 
	The best operating system for the best desktop environment ;)

Some years the openSUSE project split it's distribution and changed
the development process to accomodate different target audiences.
Tumbleweed, the rolling release and Leap, a more classic, stable
distribution. In contrast to most competitors both distributions
integrate both KDE and GNOME into the same code base, offering both
at install time.

This talk aims to explain the intentions, schedules and target audiences of
both distributions, resulting in different requirements and expections for the desktop enviroments.
