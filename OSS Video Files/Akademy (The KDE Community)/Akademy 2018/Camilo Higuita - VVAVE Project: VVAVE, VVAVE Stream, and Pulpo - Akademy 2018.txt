Title: Camilo Higuita - VVAVE Project: VVAVE, VVAVE Stream, and Pulpo - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	This presentation aims to take on an overview of Vvave as a whole project by re-introducing Vvave as cross-platform application, presenting the Vvave stream platform, Pulpo MIR’s (music information retrieval) system and showcasing the multiple ways the community can get involved.

The porting of Vvave to Kirigami:
https://vvave.kde.org/beta.html

Vvave started as a simple music player, and pretty fast has evolved to become a larger project.
Last year, when I first presented Babe to the KDE community at Akademy Almeria, the talk about the Kirigami framework got me excited and then I started making Vvave a truly cross-platform application and mobile-ready, so I started working on Vvave to make use of QQC2 and Kirigami and the road has been great so far and now Vvave runs on Android, Linux GNU desktops and is ready for Plasma Mobile.

The Vvave stream platform:
https://vvave-stream.kde.org/

On the Vvave presentation talk from last year, I tried to make a point about the benefits of letting the multimedia desktop applications learn from the internet, with that idea still on mind I started pondering on the idea of implementing an open music information platform to furthermore bring closer Vvave to the internet. Such platform would not only benefit Vvave, but perhaps many other music players.

The platform is named Vvave stream, it’s up and running and its goal is to become a free/open platform that resembles a mixture of Genius/SoundCloud/LastFM/Spotify.

Pulpo MIR system

Vvave and the Vvave stream platform both use a basic implementation of a MIR system called Pulpo, a system that makes use of several web services to collect music information to later on analyze in order to give contextual feedback to the application about the music collection.

Getting involved:

Vvave, Vvave stream and Pulpo are parts of the VVAVE project that covers much more spaces than, maybe, someone would suspect, and there are a lot of ways the community could get involved: from testing to contributing with code on different parts with JavaScript, QML, C++, Python, to working on the UX/UI design of Babe application and the BabeIt platform, to translations, and also helping with data analysis, web crawling and data mining on the Pulpo MIR system.

talk to you about

00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:29,360
[Music]

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,130
[Music]

00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:14,640
this year

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,630
[Music]

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:52,350
so when is using Kitakami to make a

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,700
conversion application so you know

00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:00,240
that's too small stream tuples and also

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,220
if you see spiral that Maui projects

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:10,760
a little set of the blade controls

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:14,790
is a logical molecule so with this

00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:19,080
transition from give which is to keep

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:22,500
with controls to the application match -

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:28,489
we need multiple at the foreign powers

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,709
of convention security the application

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:36,330
running on Android this is actually a

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:39,920
screenshot and I will then later show

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,920
you how alive

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:06,799
so one of the ideas when I submit the

00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:09,290
abstract for this presentation was no

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:14,049
need to tell you what a weight is about

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:16,700
but also waste people treated too late

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:21,040
to the application of the project as a

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:24,469
whole so if you are interested in

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,870
JavaScript or technologies that allow

00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:33,620
streaming you can find me on social

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,659
media and let me know and we can chat

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,019
and find a way that it will help in

00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,019
getting both

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:45,200
so last year I presented the application

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,159
with the idea of a music player a music

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,510
manager the manager speculation

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,150
contextually and semantics instead of

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,870
the tradition of where you sleep latest

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,689
music players and managers work these

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:06,799
ideally are made use of metadata

00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:08,150
information and one of the Empire system

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,949
that is music information retrieval

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,150
system this project turned out to be

00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,870
cuckoo

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:22,220
that is they amuse retrieval ng for

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:26,000
parole so what it does right now still

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,030
change our works data rating starts

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,730
Rikki's lyrics tax

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:39,980
information from the internet if tuples

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:44,930
of web browser and it's partial one that

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:48,140
is the data extraction and analysis from

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:51,080
the information that is structurally to

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,460
get suggestions based on other artists

00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:03,680
which one is similar or based on that

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:06,170
information should make the questions so

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,520
you are also interesting in the spiral

00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:19,610
which is that analysis right now it is

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:27,500
making use of for natural language

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:34,160
processing and this is what progress so

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:38,060
forth there are some other planet so I'm

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:42,230
gonna show you a little bit about it is

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,570
a platform that is intended to make use

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:49,130
of culpo very secure formation of jail

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:54,400
system so then here for the platform is

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,400
a basic information sharing system and

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:15,360
and some parts for it already

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:19,039
they are being hosted by keys so they

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,280
left a theater the platform is to have a

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,400
place where users can share information

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:33,930
about music and also get information

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:39,419
about divided into sections one is an

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:42,690
OCR engine that allows like for example

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:44,400
if you can grab a patient for medics I

00:06:42,690 --> 00:07:05,789
don't know if you know the size genius

00:06:44,400 --> 00:07:11,690
there loves the users many certificates

00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:11,690
on the top also to share information

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:27,120
sources with in follow another user so

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,320
for example if you are you see wait in

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,729
Jalandhar device you can sync your

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:41,070
collection with your collection computer

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:43,430
also making use of water so the

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:48,050
reference for this

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:52,699
kinda like a mix of them some cloud and

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:56,120
energy given there are no lying open

00:07:52,699 --> 00:08:00,430
source options for this kind of

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,430
platforms like some other jeans

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,970
this is are some of the services de

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:13,430
porco is making use of so far to retain

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:16,250
information so it is basic information

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,430
and the data for places noticed my new

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,220
secret for the time visa but also tries

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,380
to achieve a stock and other contextual

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:32,089
information through social networks

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:35,140
Facebook Twitter the technologies to be

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,140
used to

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,120
so before I start showing you their life

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,529
demo I want to let you know the

00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:01,290
costing two sessions one is to talk

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:06,420
about weight furthermore it slowly about

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:09,240
the platform just one spin plan and

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:13,410
discuss the design of the normally the

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:17,059
platform but also the application and

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:21,920
the other both session is going to be

00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:21,920
for the Mallik project wait

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,450
so right now I'm going to show you the

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:58,070
by the way you can find out when later

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:02,540
this week testing packages for for the

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:08,060
beta release they're going to be that

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:10,250
package and also it be paid for after so

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,700
you can download both and drag the

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,700
application in the high works

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:42,480
until we decide is weight running on

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:47,040
android and these other sizes when

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:53,670
running on system as I say the keys of

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:59,370
pedagogy so the UI is adaptable on paper

00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:03,660
and their states are so I won't go into

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,550
too much detail in the session but we

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:11,150
will show you how it works

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:19,250
the hassle main place has the basic

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:19,250
privacy Butte and you can fridge

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,599
and also by making use of the engine

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,350
I think is not shown

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,930
I was making some changes

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,850
they couldn't have time to retrieve them

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,850
a diathermic is supposed to

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,480
love I want to show you running our own

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,480
does normal wife

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,339
so in very nice people today I think

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:21,050
that worst music player that shall be

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:21,050
words of love in the wild so hopefully

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,120
[Music]

00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:04,240
[Applause]

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:04,240
[Music]

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,260
yeah that's what I wanted to show you

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,710
[Music]

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,760
[Music]

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:59,990
I think water whatever it's fine I just

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,590
it's like a play I did because it was

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,120
supposed to make way but then life is a

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,210
long story about the name because people

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,460
don't really like it so there is still

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:16,510
update around you can call away or wait

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,510
whatever it is fun

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:46,920
well thanks to Kitakami has been easy as

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:52,860
it is part of the project Maui as I say

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:56,830
it has taken for example a lot of UI

00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:02,040
design position like to removing

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:05,410
toolbars and trying to make feet for the

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:09,250
protection devices and also for testers

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:12,370
so it's kind of been breached and trying

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,000
to figure out how to make you work good

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,000
on both devices

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:28,310
yeah there are several applications that

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,400
I will be showing in the profession that

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,330
is a file manager also works in plasma

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,830
mobile pantry

00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:40,810
desktops image gallery manager and

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,810
