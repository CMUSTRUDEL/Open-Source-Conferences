Description: 
	Back in 2016, 3 young developers started to work on a project with a goal to make the 3D Printing world a better place.

The 3D Printing world in its core is based on the Open Source world. That movement started back in 2004 with the RepRap (reprap.org) project, when the first patents on 3DPrinting started to expire. With that a lot of hardware and software projects started to pop up. Despite the long Open Source tradition within the 3D printing community, there isn't any good cross-platform solution to govern our printers. In this presentation we will explain how Atelier offers a solution to host many 3D printers easily.

A Free Software solution using Qt and KDE technologies for KDE.
