Title: Neofytos Kolokotronis - Streamlined Onboarding of New Contributors - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	One of the three proposals the KDE community voted as a goal for the upcoming years was about improving the procedure of getting new contributors involved.

In this talk I will present this goal, outline what we have done over the last months, explain what needs to be done and signpost the way forward.

Are we doing enough KDE can stay healthy and continue to grow as a community and organization?

In proposing the idea, I wished for us to standardize and enhance the onboarding process of our community so we can make the most of the people that show interest to contribute.

The talk should interest everyone contributing to KDE and especially people that lead various aspects of our community and projects. For this goal to have an impact, we need to act together in embracing newcomers.

	00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,570
so yes I'm gonna be talking about this

00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,400
tipline a birthday gift particular stone

00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,070
which was the third pot that was voted

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,650
by our community so handwork up for how

00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,210
was it over the following years I'm the

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,520
one that actually proposed his goal as a

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,279
newcomer so I give that a nice example

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,660
actually of how as I was already knew

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,469
Tamara was able to influence the

00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,180
community as someone starting you so

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,420
things happen if we are like active and

00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,350
have ways to contribute to the call in

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,140
the community starting for me the

00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,179
definition of are working in simple

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,879
words is about welcoming people into

00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:54,730
your community and getting them to know

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,280
and that wire the necessary skills

00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,199
knowledge and behaviors so they can

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,749
become become effective and productive

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,379
members of your team of your community

00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:06,700
as soon as possible

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,710
in other words were talking about

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,460
socialization in the context of an

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,380
organization community a smaller team

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,360
depending on your context we're talking

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,400
about integration with other people were

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,690
talking about building relationships

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,870
getting to know the culture of the

00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,000
organization or the team get him to know

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,530
the team structure and of course how it

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,820
gets him back down what are the

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,920
procedures involved into that this team

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,840
important Association or usually our

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,900
organization to the largest ones to

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,790
Antibes their smallest team everywhere

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,120
it maintains a healthy and vibrant

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:50,140
community in art in the open-source

00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,630
community context is increased as a bus

00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,480
factor I think it helps you attract new

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,310
contributors so probably higher the

00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,680
chances of someone being also maintainer

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,780
in your project and contributed to it it

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,760
helped us grow the project for similarly

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,130
the same reasons and of course always

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,319
attracting new black new people bring

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,780
with it different ideas various

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,870
perspectives and perhaps suggestions for

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,230
different solutions

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,030
the ones that have been doing so far so

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,340
what we're great and important what were

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,430
actually doing is that we are making it

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,349
excited exciting for newcomers we create

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,330
advocates out of people joining our

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,040
communities and then go on and share

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,360
things about community and how great it

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:35,239
is and how well they are they are

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,160
finding it it increases the contribute

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,739
orientation as more people stick around

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,530
and help an overlock the long term and

00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:46,160
for all these reasons that's vital to

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,590
our project there are some obstacles

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,390
here because as we all know it is a very

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,610
decentralized community which is very

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,130
Tigers works mostly online and remotely

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,629
there are hundreds of contributors and

00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,340
thousands of different projects each

00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,500
doing their own thing in their little

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,950
corner so it's not easy to push like a

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,690
goal throughout the community so we need

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,280
to do this together

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,860
there is nothing that I or some other

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
person can do just by working on it

00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,000
it can't happen like that we all need to

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,609
do it collaboratively and each one in as

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,260
the project initiative project that we

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:25,040
are involved where do you find new

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,319
contributors well they are usually the

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,959
periphery of your team we are talking

00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,329
here about any skill photoacoustic uses

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,549
you might have around people spending

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,489
the time to report facts maybe test your

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,560
releases share their ideas in your

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,329
community respond to other users and

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,269
your forms of our channels that you have

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:46,370
for communicating so keep an eye for

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,139
those people as those are the potential

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,910
interns because they ask the ones the

00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,470
people that actually care about your

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,100
project

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,050
and I'm committed to it however I would

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,360
like to reserve it you are objections to

00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,830
people that are a bit more in the

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,470
shadows that might be a little bit

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,570
higher and don't find a voice of their

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,430
own but they might still be around

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,650
so try to look out for those people in

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,150
New York team and your community they

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,040
might have doubts about making their

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,860
first steps they might find the whole

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,290
thing intimidating for them but if you

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:22,049
just usually step up and guide them into

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,049
your project usually and make wonders

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,540
ever since the goal was voted there has

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,100
been some progress so far we have worked

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,350
on the updating of our getting in

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,570
voltage in the maintain the website we

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,180
try to avoid any duplication making it

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,070
simpler and more direct to get you where

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,370
you want contribute depending on your

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,790
skills many projects I was happy to see

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,950
that have started already working on me

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,760
distinguishing junior jobs like facts

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,530
that are specifically maybe adopted

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,690
people that I need in their community I

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,370
know the kidney connect developers have

00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,830
blogged about the also the laser

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,740
developers and the plasma hi his team is

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,360
doing some good work from Bad France the

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,400
having group improvement the happen

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,500
improvements to the registry fabricator

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,840
which was a bit complicated since in

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,940
newcomers and there was also a friend

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,100
about improvements to pasilla which

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,600
actually this was a go by zone and the

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,100
staining work needs to be done of that

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,710
some other idea that came up in this

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,210
process was about said making it easy to

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,000
adapt a development environment so

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,460
people can start working easy and

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,810
quickly only the applications frameworks

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,750
like Paris or

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:39,160
interesting there was an idea I think it

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,900
was by the Debian project that we should

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,490
do more about attracting contributors

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,710
and onboarding them from downstream tips

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,380
distributions since we know leadership

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,450
software distributions there might be

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,570
people interested in those dissipations

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,370
that would be willing to help upstream

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,860
there is the idea of having like a first

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,960
line of response through a welcome team

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,150
so we've seen an especially lately some

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,710
image coming to the community of hey I'm

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,560
here I want to help what can I do and

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,050
we're probably too late to respond or we

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,660
don't were not very active in guiding

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,120
people inside the community and of

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,580
course it would be great if we can

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,110
connect new people to old Stuart and

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,960
more experienced people around our

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,760
community so trying to find a person to

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,330
mentor a newcomer every time that would

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,270
be amazing

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,280
I want to talk a bit more about the

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,520
plasma by team who just actually had

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,260
people doing some things they set up a

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,120
coop we have six guys on setting up a

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,060
development environment so people can

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,669
get involved and make it easier to find

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,070
their way into plasma they have set up

00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,770
an interactive get involved page I think

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,539
it is a fork of the Mozilla network that

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,430
helps you and guides you depending on

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,380
your interests and your responses in a

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,840
simple way to find your way into plasma

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,400
and graph as contribution and they have

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,770
also tracked be trying to do this

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,080
previous task which is when I talk about

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,840
this beautiful tasks are sure they're

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,419
clear descriptions of the problem try to

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,340
find and maybe include any possible

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,500
solutions for the newcomer coming in

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,010
that will tell things or here start

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,650
working on it of course if there are any

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,240
requirements for this has to be

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,220
completed it will be great if we could

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,810
include them in the dispute task and

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,590
then he links to technical resources

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,520
what are this isn't the special needs to

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,439
know so they can start

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,539
however it's important to keep in mind

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,309
that there's much more into important

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,620
than just attracting new contributors

00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:37,300
who we need to be prepared when these

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,460
new contributors come and knock on our

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,979
door what do we do with them how can I

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,779
get them involved so attacking

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,729
contribute this is great but you don't

00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:47,499
want one like ten people outside asking

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,129
how can I get involved and have no

00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:53,229
answers for them on this it's very

00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,879
important to have in mind that not

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,499
everyone coming and asking to contribute

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,389
has the same skills as the same

00:07:56,499 --> 00:08:00,879
background facts the same knowledge from

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,939
your project and your team the same time

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,889
to get involved or the dedication and

00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,559
probably different things motivate them

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,479
into contributing so what I will say

00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,979
this and all their treats too when you

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,009
see these people try to find their suit

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,830
pepper superpower this magical happen

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,120
but they're the thing they are good at

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,919
actually has corresponds to something

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,569
that you need something that we lack in

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,669
your community in your project in your

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:29,740
team so try to do that try to fit that

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,050
supermarket try to fit them and guide

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,039
them into making the most out of it into

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,719
your team so we're talking here about

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,510
setting a path leading the way for

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,419
newcomers to follow so they can be more

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,220
involved in your project so if you are

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,139
not at the moment doing anything else

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,089
that will at least pick two or three

00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,910
four or three weeks out of this small

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,490
list to do so you can help and improve

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,790
your important procedure which there is

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,529
no documentation and here we are moral

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,870
the material here is probably coders but

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:03,730
there's more to documentation the just

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,860
documentation on the code you should

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,019
probably document your procedures

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,269
you should probably document your team

00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,220
and your structure who is working on

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,810
what and how so

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,300
at someone coming in and reading about

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,230
your project can easily find the person

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,770
to talk to or to reach out to

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,960
that title set up guidelines purgative

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,910
thought started and this includes like

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,890
how do I get access to your project how

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,750
do you I'll do that for my weekend with

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,780
you could you push right from should I

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,000
talk to and all that spend the time to

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,640
produce newcomers especially to other

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,710
people and your procedures it's usually

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,720
people coming into your projects will

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,280
not not know where to do something how

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,230
can they ask for information where can

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,490
they find information and all that so I

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,950
do that at the beginning it's very

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,660
important and of course I've talked

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,460
about mentorship and its importance to

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:58,340
link newcomers to more experienced

00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,230
contributors so we prepared get to know

00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,020
your team get to know your niche its

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:08,480
have an idea what your team is likely to

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,980
know where it could be input and site to

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,570
plan for the long term we're talking

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,430
about a neutron Jupiter don't just

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,050
assign a class to them and then forget

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,490
about them it's very easy for them to

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,430
drift off and forget about your

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,870
projector from something else and miles

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,630
we all know our Pinterest panel dating

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,130
it's not so big so you have to have a

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,780
plan for that you have to have set the

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,730
path for them to follow in the long term

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,350
where do you think they can get involved

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,850
after they make their first contribution

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,760
so keep requesting things for them so be

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,810
proactive reach out to these candidates

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,090
finally thought that they would be good

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,190
at and depending on their skills fight

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:46,100
hospital correspond to their interest

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,720
and of course title makers are available

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,710
to guide them through country through

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,270
completing these tasks I'm talking about

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,030
leadership again because I find it very

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,430
very important try to find people in

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,320
your team or project that can actually

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,450
adopt a newcomer take them under their

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,790
wings especially in the beginning said

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,050
to be a great host to them show me their

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,820
are on your project what they can do one

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,150
here and how they can do it who they can

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,800
talk to and of course as time goes by

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,300
they gain confidence in our more

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,850
dependent try to fade out their

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,660
dependence on youth so they can do their

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,590
own thing with the rest of the team I

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,170
wanna talk a bit more about

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,600
relationships and intimacy and

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,910
connecting to more experienced people we

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,500
have all been newcomers at some point so

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,110
we all know that it can be intimidating

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,480
to join an already established group

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,920
that already has relationships built up

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,200
and connections and a way to communicate

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,800
that probably makes you feel an outsider

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,990
so to care for new people try to reduce

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,760
them into all that and this will

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,590
increase their sense of belonging into a

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,600
community and the higher that sense of

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,700
community of London ease into your team

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,580
into your community they hire our very

00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,180
attention rates and people not talking

00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,640
off finally I would say try to be more

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,950
strategic try to shed some longer talk

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,310
long term goals in terms of reporting

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,200
find the objectives that are will guide

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,180
you and will take you there and try to

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,280
find out the tactics on how to get there

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,080
so you need to take in mind what

00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,030
behaviors do you want your newcomers to

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,490
perform in your project in your team

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,260
what what do you want them to do think

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,700
of what emotions we want to evolve into

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,260
them do you want to make them curious

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,330
about your project you want to make them

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,370
may be challenged by your project maybe

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,500
you want to make them feel proud about

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,730
contributing to your project you can

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,710
evoke different emotions that could

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,690
still work and think then about what

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,880
actions do you need to do and your team

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,850
needs to do in order to get that

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,400
reaction from them I have here an

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,920
example let's say that goal is here to

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,480
improve the reporting of newcomers you

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,160
could choose the objective of keeping

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,220
newcomers around after their first

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,410
comment and a way to do that to make you

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,300
come and speak confident and proud so

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,740
when they feel proud and confident their

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,020
higher are the trenches of staying

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,300
around and a couple of tactics that you

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,280
could use in this example are to praise

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,140
and acknowledge their contributions we

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,950
would do that in public in social

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
network

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,320
we are many please include them in your

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,250
credits of your application of project

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,800
and all that

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,500
another one is as we mentioned area to

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,150
assign support attached to them so by

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,000
committing them successfully they feel

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:26,520
that they are confident is more is

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,850
better so they will move on to other us

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,980
as well and they won't be frightened so

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,590
we're talking here about making people

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,150
feel part of our team so they need to

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,580
feel that they are thick part is

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,410
welcomed that their opinion within our

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,540
team and within our our community is

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,910
valued and of course that we'll have

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,880
tasks to assign to them so they can

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,490
contribute themselves to this and this

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,770
all this app try to respond with each

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,230
people offering for help and to join

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,790
your project in any way try to spend

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,340
some time to learn a bit more about them

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,170
and their skills experience and anything

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,510
they bring with them that could be

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,740
useful to your project guide them check

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,750
them by hand into their first

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,330
contributions they say that knowledge

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,180
when this happens spend the time to

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,070
introduce two procedures and cultures of

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,840
your team and anything special that they

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,330
need to know connect them to other

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,970
contributors keep them over the long

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,210
term motivated and challenged by maybe

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,740
raising the difficulty of the task we

00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,690
assigned to them so they can feel that

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,340
they're doing more and of course in the

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,320
long run past the gate owning more

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,540
independence try to turn them into

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,890
mentors ourselves so in the future they

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,630
are will be the ones that would be

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,080
guiding the information through your

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,450
team people are always complaining about

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,100
it time and yes this is true and

00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,890
especially in open source projects that

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,410
is even more of an issue but onboarding

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,880
is something that you work on today or

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,590
tomorrow and you're done with it and

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,300
probably everything that that's true

00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,310
value to your project all day long

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,170
takes time they are talking about good

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,750
code or put that on documentation and

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,360
all that rebuilding relationship so you

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,640
need to have to take the time to spend

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,380
it on onboarding but this will only add

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,810
higher vigor to your project in the long

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,360
term as people come together the

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:18,090
relationship has stronger and the higher

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,620
the transition over I was surprised to

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:24,300
see that there are many newcomers here

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,920
talk a bit more about that but yeah my

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,530
advice to them as a new parent myself

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,870
and for my personal experience try to be

00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,160
more persistent don't be disappointed by

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,990
the first thing that goes wrong maybe

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,630
get a bad reaction or maybe you may get

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,240
bad comment or whatever buddies try to

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,530
be persistent try it yourself to ask and

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,930
learn more about the project and the

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,640
thing we are getting into there are many

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,190
things to learn about the project so to

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,990
make it easier for you don't be shy

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,120
share your opinion with the rest of the

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,220
team but be prepared to accept any

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,290
criticism because you might not know of

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,240
something on how are things that and of

00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,890
course as soon as possible try to make

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,930
connections within your team this was

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,670
only help you in the long term and the

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,220
team itself make the most of you out of

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,170
your collaboration that vice that I was

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,390
given when I first went in here knows -

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,280
I am about everything was to try not

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,080
already like I'm a member I'm here I'm

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,200
trying to help I have the motivation and

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,580
the and the willingness to help so if

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,320
you're here and you're already offering

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:24,420
try to act like you're already member of

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,100
PD and things will be fine from my end

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,350
going for what I would like to gather a

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,510
bit more feedback from newcomers because

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,070
we have some ideas and some idea both

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,980
but we think we can improve

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,230
Nubian candy but we want to make sure

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,180
that all these ideas correspond to the

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,850
actual issues that newcomers found when

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,370
they are filling a community so I said

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,959
come here to reach out to me if you find

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,300
that there's something I didn't mention

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,910
or the custom idea how to improve the

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,579
process when we found a big problem may

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,079
be also there are lots of experienced

00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,470
contributors that could help us on this

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,360
front

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,819
you are probably needing a similar

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,470
project for 11th of time and you are

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,959
probably already doing things in that

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,390
supporting that are working for you and

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,970
your team so to share that with me or

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,549
with other people so we can exchange

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,850
ideas and see how our projects and

00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,419
allocated communities can benefit from

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,970
it

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,919
it would be amazing to see even

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,309
multi-day projects being active on this

00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,949
goal his title is Casa paddleboarding in

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,919
your project in your community tried to

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:32,169
beam to bring it up try to see where

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,330
this area of improvement what have you

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,860
been doing so far what have you we've

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,480
not been doing and have been lacking and

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,919
we can do better based on the things I

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,290
suggested or maybe you can come up with

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,240
ideas on your own and of course we're

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,730
here to help each other and exchange our

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,530
identity we are in the process of

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,960
already organizing the first print for

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,640
this call we chose a topic of making it

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,830
quick and easy to set up a development

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,630
environment as we know the kiddies

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,440
project about coding so we want to make

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:02,770
it as as soon as possible and what to

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,630
make it easy and very simple for

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,659
newcomers to get to play with the code

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,299
learn it and start contributing to the

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,700
area

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,969
would like the rest for this print

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,919
sometimes in autumn 2018 in Athens

00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:17,959
Greece and in divide them have the

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,190
skills or interest or willingness to

00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:24,349
contribute do join us in this task so we

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:28,339
can arrange that and see how what we can

00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:30,019
do and I'll let you pick your attention

00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:32,929
to the couple of other box opening here

00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:35,089
Emil relating to this call on Monday

00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:36,499
there is the column both that we

00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:39,409
discussed about how we can integrate

00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:41,329
phonon and packaging to Jesus that they

00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,149
offer into the key development process

00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:46,369
there's on Monday also the generic a

00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:47,959
divorce discussion and on Tuesday a

00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:50,089
specific discussion about these three

00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:52,719
mind important goals and strains in

00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:52,719
order that all

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:08,100
[Applause]

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
questions

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,950
I'm not sure what the janitor is we'll

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,950
talk okay

00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:51,999
that's how the whole idea started to do

00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,469
something centralized but the more I

00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,509
looked into it the more I realized that

00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:57,999
it's probably not gonna work into KD

00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:01,359
because I've seen many teams do their

00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:03,519
own thing throughout KD community and so

00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,259
that's why the idea of they work for me

00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,830
when something came up like having some

00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:11,289
people to respond first before joining

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,779
randomly but the Moraga like I worked on

00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:15,639
the ideas I realized that he needs to

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,349
decentralized probably to do something

00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:19,899
centralized there is a get import page

00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,940
and all that like to get you started but

00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,609
there are too many projects running at

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,289
the same time and people usually already

00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,809
know the project they want to get

00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,579
involved they like they say caming or I

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,799
don't know some other application so

00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:35,919
they already reach out to those people

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,389
but yeah any ideas on about doing

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,079
something under the satellites are

00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,079
welcoming you

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:51,050
duration specific what to do wait shy

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,050
people say

00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,869
[Music]

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,330
well the concept was for everyone no

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,850
it's more or less on the lines that I

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,230
mentioned already so everyone joining

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,120
and get community and you project

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,070
especially on coding they need to be

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,720
aware with the language the coding

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,790
language for starters that we are using

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,370
so absolute documentation of that are

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,750
put resources on how to what they need

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,370
to read actually what's their homework

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,940
so they can get started into your

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,320
project

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,770
that's the first step so have something

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,750
to show them but avoid their tour read

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,400
the manual approach that we not work

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,460
with you commit especially tight people

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,710
so you need to have that but also in

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,420
addition step make yourself available so

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,100
they can feel that they can ask about

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,840
anything right there are no stupid

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,000
questions that's a biggie that's very

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,190
important I think today like a year

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,420
after keep asking people that I have

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,310
connections we think really about the

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,630
simplest things and I'm very happy that

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,090
they respond to me about that and don't

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,070
just point me to something else so yeah

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,780
and of course reach out to them if you

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,240
are currently identifying already know

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,610
who is China try to reach out to them

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,590
offer a helping hand try to talk to them

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:18,280
to see how they forget you know that

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,280
more or less

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,239
