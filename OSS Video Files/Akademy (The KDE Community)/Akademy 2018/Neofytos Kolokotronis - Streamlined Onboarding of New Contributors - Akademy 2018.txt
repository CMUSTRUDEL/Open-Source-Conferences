Title: Neofytos Kolokotronis - Streamlined Onboarding of New Contributors - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	One of the three proposals the KDE community voted as a goal for the upcoming years was about improving the procedure of getting new contributors involved.

In this talk I will present this goal, outline what we have done over the last months, explain what needs to be done and signpost the way forward.

Are we doing enough KDE can stay healthy and continue to grow as a community and organization?

In proposing the idea, I wished for us to standardize and enhance the onboarding process of our community so we can make the most of the people that show interest to contribute.

The talk should interest everyone contributing to KDE and especially people that lead various aspects of our community and projects. For this goal to have an impact, we need to act together in embracing newcomers.
