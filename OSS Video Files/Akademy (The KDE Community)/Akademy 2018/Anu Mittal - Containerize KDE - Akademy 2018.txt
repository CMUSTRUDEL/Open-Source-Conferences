Title: Anu Mittal - Containerize KDE - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	The talk will begin with a general introduction to Containerization technologies and why we need it.
Followed by how we have used Docker to setup KDE neon and how we can use flatpak to setup desktop applications.

Setting up a development environment for a software can be time-consuming and at times a bit confusing
There are many libraries and packages that need to be installed and which might also cause conflict with the existing system packages. There are various ways to containerize an application, we will discuss two major approaches - Docker and Flatpak.

Docker helps a developer by setting up a sandboxed development environment in a container which can be used for debugging, testing or developing a new feature. You can run multiple such environments parallelly e.g. stable & development environment. Flatpak provides a sandbox environment in which users can run applications in isolation from the rest of the system.

We will see a live example of both of these technologies, how they differ from each other and when one is preferred over the other.
