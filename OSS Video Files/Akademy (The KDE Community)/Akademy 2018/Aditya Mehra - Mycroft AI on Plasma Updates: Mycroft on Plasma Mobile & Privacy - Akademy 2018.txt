Description: 
	Modern-day proprietary digital assistants are popping up everywhere as the proliferation of smart devices are increasing having a substantial impact on how user data is handled which potentially blurs privacy lines. Mycroft AI is the Open Source alternative that puts the end-user in control of their privacy and provides complete transparency on how user data is used. This presentation will showcase a demo on some of the most the recent improvements and developments in the Plasma Mycroft project and also give a quick preview on Mycroft on Plasma Mobile project. This presentation will discuss and demo how a privacy-centric intelligent digital assistant can further enhance your KDE Plasma desktop experience via voice interaction and further touch upon how Mycroft puts you in control of your data.

Mycroft AI is an open source community committed technology that ties natural language processing, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and powerful APIs together to create a powerful experience allowing users to manipulate their devices through voice control. Mycroft AI is the digital implementation of a modern day virtual assistant on the Linux Platform that can help a user conduct a multitude of task via voice/text.

This talk will also include how users can decide what data to share with Mycroft Skills and how the community can volunteer to improve Mycroft's Open Datasets.
