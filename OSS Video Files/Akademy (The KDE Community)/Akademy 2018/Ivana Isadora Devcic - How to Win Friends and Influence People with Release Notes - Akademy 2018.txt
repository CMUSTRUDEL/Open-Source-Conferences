Title: Ivana Isadora Devcic - How to Win Friends and Influence People with Release Notes - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	This talk will present 5 ways in which release notes can be improved and used to attract attention, draw in new users, and motivate people to contribute to your project. The advice presented in the talk will be supported by research and observations on various FLOSS communities, but also on proprietary software. The goal is to convince developers and project maintainers that release notes are an incredibly valuable tool that should not be dismissed as an afterthought.

"Bugfixes and improvements."

Those three notorious words have almost become a meme in software development circles, and could easily be blamed as one of the main reasons why users don't read release notes, or consider them largely useless.

But it doesn't have to be like that.

Release notes are an important part of the software release process, and they play a big role in promotion as well. Transforming them into something that the users will enjoy reading and look forward to is not only possible, but also desirable. There are different ways to create release notes, and while developers usually look for the easiest, most automated way to save time, it's worth investing a bit more into their quality by giving them a human touch. This approach opens up an opportunity to involve non-coding contributors in your project - people who can write well and give feedback from an end-user's perspective.

The advice that will be presented in this talk can apply to any software project - FLOSS or not - but more importantly, it can be used to include various KDE projects into the the KDE Community goal "Streamlined Onboarding of New Contributors", as well as to increase the KDE Community's reach through promotion efforts.

One of the sessions at Akademy 2013 was dedicated to improving the release notes of KDE projects. Five years later, it would be interesting to revisit the conclusions and advice of those sessions. I intend to contact the contributors who participated in them, and compare how KDE projects used to approach release notes then versus how they approach them now.

okay so hi everyone think

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,119
[Music]

00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:17,900
this is my first Academy ever and also

00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:19,730
my first big conference talk ever so if

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,650
I start following you were talking too

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,800
fast just raise your hand and ask me to

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,050
repeat what I said I will do that so the

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,509
title of my talk is obviously a huge

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:35,780
cliche I'm going to explain what it

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:38,210
actually means in a bit don't meet so my

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:45,949
name is Yana I joined Kitty from the

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:48,800
last year in Keaney program working on

00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:50,629
making sure KD as a brand and that

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,000
community gets the recognition that it

00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:55,000
deserves and on establishing a framework

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,800
I also work every technical writer at a

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,570
Croatian company called reversing laughs

00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,330
it's a security company that develops

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,280
software for all our analysis and

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,020
addiction we have some really cool

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,780
technologies unfortunately all our

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,009
products are proprietary but we try to

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,869
give back to the open-source community

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,330
as much as we can

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:27,600
and around 90 percent of our developers

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,490
all you

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,700
they're computers and a lot of them use

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,470
plasma so that's great

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,810
we're also hiring so if you're

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,180
interested in developer or there are

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,030
positions you can ask me about this

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,740
after a talk so yeah release notes

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:52,710
exciting am i right

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm sure I don't have to say this but

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,789
just in case there are compilation of

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,729
new features changes and resolve issues

00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,070
in a particular star everything's in an

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:14,100
ideal world they would contain all this

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:18,600
information but in reality they and a

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:21,060
joke but sadly a lot of them actually

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,489
look like this and this is you don't win

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,570
friends this way but what do we actually

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,100
mean when we say win friends well it

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,970
means you can use release notes to get

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,420
people to make it easier for sensitive

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,420
product

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,709
also to leave an impression of a

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,980
trustworthy product that they will be

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,410
loyal to as users so why release notes

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,930
are

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,870
for this well get there often the first

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,270
user touch point that for your new

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,000
release so many people will tell you oh

00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:02,740
nobody reads release notes but you know

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,350
everyone is still making them so people

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,420
obviously won't batteries there are

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,520
requests for better release notes in

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,250
almost every project so obviously they

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,010
have a purpose and they're a standard

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,900
part of every suffer release package so

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:21,490
since there's only there one and try to

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,870
transform them into something more so

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:27,270
how do I actually do this

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:30,010
well I've collected a list of five basic

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,440
suggestions of course they are just

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,210
skiffins you can find tons of ideas for

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,300
improving release notes all around the

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:40,420
internet and which advice to follow

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,670
depends on what your focus is but the

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,580
ones I've selected start with a polling

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,940
so make sure your lessons are readable

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,890
what this means is that you need to pay

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,060
attention to how they are tormented and

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:57,670
organized this will often depend on

00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,600
where the where's our game this is

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,600
usually a website

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,030
it's a good practice to include a

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,550
summary at the release notes this

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,040
summary can be used for example or when

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,980
you are publishing your software in an

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,630
app store or the package manager you can

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,340
also use this summary on social media

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:26,150
and then I believe it makes it easier to

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:29,449
share it you can also order features and

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,639
changes in order of importance so how

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,010
I'm awarded a feature is for the user

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,910
does it affect something major and your

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,639
software or is it just a minor face

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,740
accessibility also marital law so most

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,260
release notes are posted on the project

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,660
website so that should give you enough

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,370
control over how they're presented so

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,010
you can make sure the contrast is bright

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,470
and the colors on the website do not

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,900
hinder readability if you're including

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,010
images in your release notes make sure

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,919
to have out text or capture how this

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,900
helps us with friends it makes the

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,210
release notes easier to the gist and

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,520
they will appreciate being able to skim

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,389
through the information and still get to

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,479
most important parts nothing you can do

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,490
is make a reliable reliable in a sense

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,979
that people can be sure your release

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,229
notes are the source of truth about your

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:26,690
project so your release notes should be

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,400
checked for technical accuracy so you

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,210
don't write that kuntibhoja change when

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,970
actually wasn't reliable some sense that

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,760
you can protect users expectations and

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,060
then you need them so they might expect

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,100
extra information

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,070
so you link to documentation if

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,990
available or they might expect

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,220
installation operation structures so

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,440
you've provided with the release

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,330
providing healthy workarounds for now on

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,160
each tooth it's also a great way to

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,560
establish the release notes and

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,930
consequently your project as a reliable

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,180
if you stay consistent and always keep

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,220
doing this you should build a great

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,230
image for your project that's one that

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,370
cares about its users and provide

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:14,580
support another thing you should always

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,040
be is big clear clarity in the sense

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,720
means when your release notes serve

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,800
people who are not developers in

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,660
understand this may be the hardest part

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,889
because it involves involves asking

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,110
directly you know talking directly to

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,610
developers to other people who work on

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,440
the release and asking them what this

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,440
particular change means what are you

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,960
here because when it comes down to that

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,880
that's all user wants to know what's in

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,490
it for me what does this need for me

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,960
what has changed how can i benefit from

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,780
it so if your release was focused on a

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,970
particular feature or improvement you're

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,710
gonna get a list at first and organize

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,169
other points to support in illustrate

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,940
that this also means you don't have to

00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,160
include everything if there were some

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,190
minor changes that don't affect users

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,510
directly you don't have to waste them

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,550
you can also organize release notes

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,930
according to user expertise so for

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,210
example this change their import

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,150
important for developers or system

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,220
administrators some things that read is

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,590
the release notes also forget our new

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,479
default values so if some people values

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,570
configuration values change in your

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,680
software is always listed at

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,350
compatibility changes in security issues

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
there

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:33,430
that people sometimes don't include or

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,260
don't give enough detail on so you don't

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,360
just say we just fixed and security

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,590
issues tell me which ones you know what

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,330
was my putter fixing so I think we're

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,770
doing great job with plasma release

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,570
notes or at least announcements in this

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,570
regard because we provide everything

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,600
nothing you can do is invite users to

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,070
interact through your release so if you

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,320
want to influence people to do something

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,950
you also have to be very direct about it

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,840
this means you have to ask them to do it

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:13,330
or provide an easy way for them to do so

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:16,780
so this works yes you can ask people to

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:19,150
download your products just give them a

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,620
link or include direct sharing links for

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,080
social media so they can share your

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,060
release notes on the you can also make

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,650
people to contribute to your project or

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,800
even to improve the release numbers

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,229
themselves if your bug reports are

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,530
public you can also link them for every

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:40,030
result issue so people get more context

00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,830
or you can invite people to report so

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,630
how the simplices people it invites them

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,190
to do some action and makes them feel

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,570
involved in your project

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,570
I think fedora

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,740
and yeah so this is something that works

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:10,320
if your developers are okay with their

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,320
name being published and let's video

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,070
it's a good idea to include names of

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,380
people who worked on the project thank

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,240
you developers made changes thank you

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,160
people who test the release who meets

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,860
bug reports you can also put a name to

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,620
the release you know so all this makes

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,600
your project seem more human and people

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,240
will be my people might be more

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,430
motivated to join as contributors if

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:45,250
they see there will be directly credited

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:48,070
per day for the work so yeah this is a

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:55,870
political be always by the name the

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:58,690
person who did so benefits for you so

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,120
everything previously was you know for

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,550
the user but how can you benefit as a

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,480
project owner as pilfer from better

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:09,970
release notes well you can use them to

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,030
track the progress of your project so to

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,890
put things into a historical perspective

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,110
if you include images in your release

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,780
notes or announcements that helps you

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,379
keep people record of how your how you

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:27,549
improve your user interface hired fifty

00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,769
or time if you're hosting your release

00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:33,069
notes on your projects website which is

00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:35,229
how it's usually done you can track his

00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:39,519
reading so you can see how many people

00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:41,169
are clicked will release notes how long

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,019
will they stay on the page how long

00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:46,239
today you know how much time is spent

00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,609
did they open links to talks maybe or

00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:51,729
links to download yourself you can track

00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:55,929
for this if you want another thing you

00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:58,899
can do which is provide solutions for

00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,429
known issues on your own website so if

00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,229
it's indexed by search engines that

00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:06,779
means that search traffic gets your own

00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:06,779
website instead of some brand new forum

00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:17,589
because if you are one small person

00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:20,079
project you probably don't see this as a

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,209
worthwhile investment because all this

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,859
advice means that you will have to spend

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,929
time actually manually right in the

00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:31,190
release notes instead of exporting them

00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:34,910
from you know whatever you do

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,310
so this is then your opportunity to

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,029
invite contributors to find people to

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,649
help you

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:44,540
pretty better really smooth the fact is

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,399
that users want release notes they want

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,110
to understand what's new project they

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,000
won't know what to expect from it

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:54,800
so another fact is that journalists or

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,019
journalists will use your release notes

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,240
as a source of information for the

00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,620
article and you don't want them to get

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,110
some info ball and present your product

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,449
so divide contributors people don't need

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,459
to be developers to help you is a great

00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,410
opportunity for people for example like

00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,860
me with a background in writing or

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,689
humanities you can announce that you're

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,240
looking for help in your community you

00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:22,310
can open a task for it in your work

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:29,870
track and start very fantastic social me

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:33,800
you can go to our advice how do I get

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,590
these new people to help you can almost

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,669
read guidelines

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,669
[Music]

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:51,960
really nice hot actually

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:53,850
right so yeah I mean again we all want

00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,790
our products to succeed and we want

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,830
people to like them obviously so even

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,740
something that may seem so small and

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:04,140
significant like release notes here

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,440
really really a big difference in how

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:11,670
the outside world perceives our products

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,460
and the work we do so that's pretty much

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,890
it thank you for a time in attention I

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:20,180
hope this was at least a little bit

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,180
useful to you and

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,600
[Applause]

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,419
[Music]

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,419
[Applause]

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:22,920
so people shout out the question if you

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,920
have to work at the cross okay

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,100
[Music]

00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:56,660
thank you for the questions are really

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,029
good one so you may have seen this

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,220
approach in some mobile applications

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,959
some of them do this so when you update

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,160
you get release notes for the

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,350
application right that's what you're

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,160
going to do I think it would be a good

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,800
idea for a single page so for example

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,170
you update dolphin you get really smell

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,740
just for dog but I could get it for the

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,059
whole key applications set that might be

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,160
too much yeah

00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,740
the problem with this is that it's easy

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,499
to dismiss so you know user can just

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,439
click close and never leave it but the

00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:32,569
other man it's more visible than posting

00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:35,689
them on a release notes like on the

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:36,949
website right so if you actually plan to

00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:39,019
do this I think it would be a good idea

00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:42,800
to maybe try testing like doing maybe

00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:45,220
testing if you can but yeah I think it's

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,220
not a bad

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,690
in

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,690
[Music]

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,830
that's great what state thank you

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,519
[Music]

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,529
[Applause]

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,760
if you either want help with religious

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,760
you can always come to get it from

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,809
for example of how I do it in my work

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,809
and I suppose it would apply to South

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,789
East project we get a role changelog

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,830
from the developer so not a lot of

00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:44,679
context basically just what he mentioned

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:47,409
just you know and then we go and try to

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,630
put it in language like explain what it

00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,159
means we talk to developers when we

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,659
don't understand what some change be so

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:56,159
what does this mean what have you done

00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:56,159
here and then you get

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,900
yeah so my work we do it in our own

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,060
shared like we have shared folders to

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,940
basically Google Docs so people work on

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,660
it together and here - you use usually

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,400
notes - Katie or so at evaporite so you

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,500
get a link where I was making changes

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,090
and you can thank you all you need is so

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,090
clear they do count with me

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:11,060
yeah that's a good practice from my

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,510
experience which is limited in honesty

00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,300
but still is - yes basically keep a

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:26,750
running log of things so you just fill

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:29,770
it as you go do too long after we start

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,770
doing that here

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,589
[Music]

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:22,159
sorry so you're asking if we consider

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,830
using some automated tools well I think

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,990
I'm not sure how every key project does

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,230
it but I think mostly we do it that way

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,310
so they export you know whatever they

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:37,550
use it they export

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:40,790
finished us and you get no titles of

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,350
these tasks as a treatment and the

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,210
problem with that is that they're not

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,980
always consistently written so now

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:51,320
everyone follows the same guidance a

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,450
variety of styles so you always have to

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,670
give so many of editing of course it

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,710
would be ideal much much easier if

00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,300
everything could be automated but then

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,790
you would have to have some skylights at

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,190
the previous step so you have to train

00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,890
developers so to say that's always right

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,260
and those tiles consistently and then

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:13,610
you wouldn't have to do so much anyway I

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:16,760
think afterwards but even without it we

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,710
would still do so many writing after

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,810
release so what we do is we take release

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,760
notes as a list and then you turn them

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,950
into an announcement which is an actual

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,240
text with images similar to what I

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,240
showed with

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,360
things that were done a lot of that can

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,540
be bought me yeah but I'm not sure which

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,830
tools you would use for that I expect

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,830
there are a lot of them that we should

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,359
