Kdenlive

Learn how to create "vanity" transitions and other interesting things you can do with the Kdenlive video-editing software (and others).

Kdenlive offers you a great many of transitions and effects to spice up your videos. However, sticking to what is just in the box, can have the opposite effect, making you movies boring an trite.

In this talk I will show how, by combining different techniques (and even different applications), you can create your own "vanity" transitions with fun animations and other tricks that are not obvious at first glance.

Along the way, we will discover what Kdenlive's limits are, why they exist, and when to use something different.
