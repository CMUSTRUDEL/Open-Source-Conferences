Title: Markus Feilner - First Kontact?: An Enterprise User Experience with KDE Mail - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	Having been a KDE user almost from the start, over the years I have learnt lots of troubleshooting, hacking and optimizing settings in Kmail, Kontact, KDE and Akonadi. And I would like to share and learn more :-)

I am using Kontact on a daily basis, in an environment with lots of E-Mails and Gigabytes of data and e.g. a variety of calendars. Three mail accounts, three different IMAP-Servers, five+ desktops to take care of, archiving, filtering, calendaring, using Kontact keyboard-only (almost), in mailing lists, searching, per-folder settings, import/export of data,

I want to share my insights and get a discussion going - hopefully with the audience - that this presentation might spark with the goal of making Kontact(Kde-PIM) better. There's no other working Enterprise level Mail/Groupware Client for Linux with so many great features.

I learnt a lot about debugging Kontact and Kmail for my needs, and even fixing with some akonaditools. I would love to present my findings and I hope to get a discussion going - with some developers? - how to:
- use
- troubleshoot
- quick setup
- copy
- revert/purge

Akonadi directories, Kontact, KDE and Kmail settings and files. Akonadictl, Akonadiconsole, Baloo, ...

one knee okay our next speaker is Marcus

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,279
Wagner this was a linear analyst is also

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,440
and right now he works at Sousa is a

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,830
team lead for documentation leading a

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,279
global team tear and now he gives a

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,619
presentation about how he lost contact

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:34,470
and how he learns to debug problems with

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:37,770
it okay I think this is fine and I'm

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,160
pretty understandable good hi everybody

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,820
hello

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,680
yeah first contact I mean I don't think

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,960
it is really a first contact for you or

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,030
for me neither

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,720
I've been using contact for a long time

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,790
and I'm going to tell you why I really

00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,500
like it why I think it is you know at

00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,900
the same time very Enterprise ready but

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,230
at the other time not that much so or

00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,750
things connected to it not that much so

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,020
that I had to learn how to fix my

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,289
problems in probably really ugly ways

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,170
and I am ready to take every every word

00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:16,259
from every developer to who might want

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,729
to tell me don't do that and I yeah you

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,490
will see good so I will tell you a

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,829
little bit about me about why KDE why

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,689
contacts which versions are used we've

00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:32,009
just seen that it is pretty new but

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,299
that's just tumbleweed and my favorite I

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,609
will show you my favorite contact

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,429
functions which I consider important for

00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,469
enterprise users like me and some

00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:42,299
exceptionally outstanding gadgetry in

00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,249
contact that is directly connected to

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,710
the letter and the last block will be

00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:48,749
troubleshooting and I'm ready for this

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,880
passion about that that's where I do the

00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:53,880
maybe ugly things I don't know

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,999
it's all up mostly also didactic I

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:02,009
learned it as I went I'll tell you why

00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:03,270
so that is me in my home my apartment

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,939
and as you can see I'm wearing and

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,990
you've been to hoody on the top a

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,340
redhead a Devi on base cap and what you

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,189
can't see but here is a chameleon so

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,709
this is one of the rare red Suzy fleece

00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:18,780
shirts that we produced once so and I

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,260
see myself like that because I

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,220
I started quite a long time ago with

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,400
Linux I'm talking about

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,680
but these versions to get just to get

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,210
that out of the way I have to this

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,450
cables a little bit too short

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:44,490
yeah I'm talking about contact inversion

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:49,500
where is it 18 or 1804 3a conadi the

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:52,430
same version velu 548 0 and a kannada

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,970
console 1804 3 all of that is pretty

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,380
recent from July 19 yeah and I'm using

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,870
of course

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,890
openSUSE I'm using tumbleweed rolling

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,950
release and it's got the newest basis

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:11,600
for especially KDE and other

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:16,140
applications that I could have and um

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,700
I've started with Sousa in 1994 I you in

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,310
the yeah as you could see with the

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,200
picture I used fedora will burn to Mint

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,049
Debian and other distributions some of

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,330
them for years some of them just shorter

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:30,959
I ran my own business which I still own

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:35,880
I worked as a consultant and journalist

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,370
for Linux magazine and I am now team

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,890
leads of 16 people who writes

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,840
documentation at Susi in a growing team

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,580
and if you're looking for a job I have

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,040
to say that of course Souza is hiring

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,239
we've got 300 open positions and we grew

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,560
to 1400 people now from the 800 that I

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,299
started with in 2015 and I'm still

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,209
writing articles I'm still doing talks

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,980
and lobbyism for open source and I think

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,750
tumbleweed really rocks up there is a

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,750
picture of me from our opposite

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,790
conference in Prague this year so this

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,650
is the inner basic set up I have to go

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,450
pretty fast because I only have 25

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,169
minutes if I want if you want to ask me

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,910
questions so the slides are free to have

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,470
so I will jump over some things but you

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,239
can read it my slides are always pretty

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,470
full of text because I want to give you

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:28,670
something to read for later also so I'm

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,970
I've been using Korea Cyrus and Duff cut

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,920
I used skelux or the same product but

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,500
different name a PHP open mail or

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,720
Samsung something Microsoft Exchange

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,120
Citadel Novell Michel Foucault's

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,130
GroupWise on cloud next cloud open

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,340
exchange and other called of carpet

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,250
implementations currently I have four

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,270
rough cut server accounts in my contact

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,940
and it's gigabytes of email on some of

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,470
the accounts I administrate mice there's

00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,360
some of the tough cut service I do is

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,540
administrate my own my own the others

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,780
are run by companies I've written some

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,260
articles for Linux magazine and others

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,030
over the years the first one was in 2007

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,040
a comparison of open source group where

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,480
the second one was a comparison under

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,510
the name of the film is kids here a

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,260
sorry some of this is in German

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,080
screenshots also but the few most

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,830
musketeers were for male clients on

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,470
Linux and I also wrote a book about

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,210
scale X but skelux never really went

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,260
open source so that was sort of like a

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,020
little bit of a failure

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,730
great great software but that's sadly

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:44,690
not open source job despite all the

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:46,580
cracks that turned up in KDE and contact

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,140
I just say that when I say the magical

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,980
number four you will all know what I'm

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,850
talking about

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,090
despite all of that I are stuck with

00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:59,750
contact ie tries to earth under bird and

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,340
claws in the years of the KDE 4 and when

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,150
a canary this didn't really work but I

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,410
came back later and because in my

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,760
opinion it has so many great features

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,800
that I regularly use in my environment

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,970
import/export smart set of wizards

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,110
automatically archive mails and data

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,210
templates drafts for new mails snippets

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,850
autocorrect and heaps of configuration

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,740
options like for folder settings mailing

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,420
lists you I guess if you using it you

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,730
know most of that for the others try it

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,460
I absolutely like the way it handles

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,560
encryption with PGP I haven't used as

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,240
much but I really like it I think it is

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,289
among the mail clients that are

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,240
available the best and II

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:47,759
this way to use and to to introduce

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,499
people to using it because they get at

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,589
the same time get an understanding of

00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:57,149
what's going on and they can really use

00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:59,039
it and what I really like a lot is how

00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:02,490
it integrates with the standard tools of

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:09,210
KDE and also with Cleopatra and gbg in

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:11,759
the background and it in one point where

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,680
the quality may vary he is it integrates

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,180
with the Communication Service I call

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,939
the communication service because it's

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,339
not only group where in fact contact is

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,050
the only group reclined on limits but

00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,979
these service I mean I wouldn't call own

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,259
an X cloud

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,289
or goobie or Facebook a group a server

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,319
it's just services that they offer and I

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:33,509
talked today with someone about who has

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,709
seen the current state of the MS

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,800
exchange connector which uses the web

00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:45,959
the web protocol what's his name again

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:49,559
but huh no no net letter from web access

00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,050
oh wow that was right I think it was

00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:54,990
that or was over was it was it before is

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,839
that the new one doesn't matter it's it

00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,219
it works pretty well but there is

00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,110
problems with Microsoft's implementation

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:04,080
that's what the last thing that I heard

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,729
from a developer but basically you can

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,819
integrate all of these services in

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,009
contact and here you see that's the

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,919
screenshot from integrating an email and

00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,800
server the Microsoft Exchange is

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,379
connector already integrates also

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,809
appointments and calendaring and this

00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,939
this is the calendar at the calendar and

00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:26,580
you can see you have Facebook and Google

00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:29,159
Calendar and and arbitrary I call

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,310
wherever you want so I am very happy

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,810
with that another thing I'm using

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,360
extensively and I've also written a long

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,939
article I think it's seven pages on that

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,240
is see if server-side email filtering to

00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:45,810
my knowledge the only standardized

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,240
server-side language small language for

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,829
filtering and that is something I did

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,930
lots of group migrations and that is

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,030
something that everybody forgets in

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,340
grouper migrations

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,220
people forgets to calculate how much

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:02,430
time their employees have to spend in

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:06,390
the migration and new setup of their

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,060
email filters and sieve is the only one

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,100
I don't have that issue because I just

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,860
choose another I went to DAF cut when

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,030
DAF car could do sieve

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,750
why should I do why should I change

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,820
before and this interface in my to my

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,090
knowledge is the best interface around

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,750
second maybe round cube but that's only

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,520
web-based you can click click click new

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,140
filters and they are stored on the

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,120
server and you can access them via a

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:40,440
file an IO file and an IO client but

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,770
sorry hmm and we are I also live also

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,070
from from from dolphin just tap seve

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:50,460
thought thought / / and your name at

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,650
server and you see the files that are on

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,160
the sieve server and you can just open

00:09:52,650 --> 00:10:03,050
them but this why this is so much better

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:08,250
the same thing the same thing that is

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:12,330
exclusive exclusive to contact is how

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,880
they is the integration of IMAP folder

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,220
sharing so if you know a little bit

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,640
about IMF you know that every folder or

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,400
mailbox on an IMF server can have access

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,870
rights so I can ground me if we have an

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,870
account on the same server I can grant

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:31,830
you the access to read write delete and

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:36,900
some other things on yeah it has append

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:40,920
yeah read write attend or all rights to

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,510
and lay box or folder on my server that

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,250
me that makes it so easy to work

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,880
together I'm using that at work with

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:54,690
colleagues we share one folder for

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:57,840
project then I think the benefits of KDE

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:02,400
are I might M&M running through open

00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,020
doors here I guess the search conadi

00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,310
search this is also you see now we're

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,790
getting directly into troubleshooting

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,620
the desktop search just hit alt f2 or

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,470
click on an empty spot on the desktop

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,910
and start typing and also your emails

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,960
and everything will be searched and

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,300
presented to you that is amazing if and

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,130
recently it works pretty well

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,900
now it's balloons used to be networked

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,380
Ballou indexes mails attachments

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,290
everything and I when I start writing a

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,590
new email I start I write your name and

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,420
I will find about five or six email

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,580
addresses of you even though we probably

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,250
have never exchanged directly an email

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,770
but your name with your email address at

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,480
whatever company you've ever with will

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,400
be in some of the documents some of the

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,170
PDF some of the mailing lists on my

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,370
system so I don't need to know your

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,050
email address I don't need an address

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,230
book anymore since about 10 years I'm

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,510
not actively maintaining or using an

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,730
address book I'm totally relying on a

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:05,290
Qunari and Ballou and it works for me

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,930
with all the hassle okay I'm I'm not I'm

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,760
not stupid there but I know there's

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,820
problems but I convinced several of my

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,620
colleagues to go to contact have a look

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:19,630
at it with all the do and with all care

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,570
that they have to take because some of

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:27,450
the things as we will see our might need

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:30,850
some work especially in my size of usage

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,540
is contact almost completely with the

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,540
keyboard and

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,920
yeah yeah but that would be like like

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,710
I'm totally out of the concept of

00:12:45,920 --> 00:13:01,560
managing and address life it's right yes

00:12:51,710 --> 00:13:03,240
yeah you have to show me that's cool I'm

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,680
using it completely with my keyboard so

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,090
when I'm when I'm for example in a new

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,540
male comes in I want to move it to the

00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:15,810
Academy or folder I just type em a.k.a

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,370
written M is for move when I mean when

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm in the list of of males

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,600
M is for move then the the filter pops

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,000
up and to the folder list and let's have

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
a k-8 and the Academy folder is is

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,810
highlighted returned and the male is

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,790
there there is something that people

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,890
don't believe when there is something

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:38,220
that the math people won't believe about

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:40,200
KDE and the extent oh yes and at home

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,570
and at work I've got three monitors and

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,150
believe it or not my contact is spread

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,940
over two monitors constantly and the

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:50,640
Edit the mail window is on the third

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,450
monitor so I have the list of folders

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:59,070
the list of emails on one HD monitor and

00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:02,180
on and the contact application spans two

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,920
monitors it is always opening like that

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,720
because I have good I can read an email

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,820
on one monitor I have two lists and the

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,200
mailing than the nail the list of

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,300
folders a list of mayors on the second

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,130
monitor and an editable perform on the

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,990
third monitor so I have always total

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,990
overview and with the extended studies

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,390
of kwin I can just make that permanent

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,120
this is the feature it's an extended

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,850
setting in the window properties in this

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,940
case for example just through the fun

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,950
13,000 wide 7,000 hi I mean I don't have

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,510
that time that I don't have stacks

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:38,160
stacks or 4k monitors but so that was

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,760
the first half I think I'm quite good in

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,060
time or not the first half that was the

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,390
trays and now we're coming to the to

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,720
this stuff you know this I guess it's

00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,200
it's something stalled yeah the folder

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,330
isn't

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,250
isn't fetched it's like your internet

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,500
connection stopped working or whatever

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,460
you don't know what to do and yes it

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,850
still happens sadly or just what

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,100
happened just today up here sending was

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,680
successful but the message could not be

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,490
moved to the folder sent for sent

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,220
messages so I the message probably

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,380
reached the people I was sending it to

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,750
but why on earth couldn't it send it

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:27,990
into this folder so I tried an add-on

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,690
module in contact - protocol eyes the

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,800
protocol to lock all activities and I

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,360
hope you follow up with the expert

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,300
plugin does maybe some that can tell me

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,800
but the protocol is pretty fancy because

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,540
I can see ok ok I stopped moving off the

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,570
message that is the protocol you have to

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,000
restart contact footbath and I stopped

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,520
it I stopped the the move of the message

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,970
then I started again and but it's a only

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,070
set didn't work so if there may be

00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:00,330
situations where this helps but this one

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:02,160
it didn't help usually when you run it

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,710
really well keep running into problems

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,260
like this that don't solve itself here's

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:10,860
a little how do that I learned what to

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,960
do to fix that I mean some of you will

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,120
maybe say don't do these markers you

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:20,280
can't tell them that but hey works for

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,870
me and I'm not talking so I stopped and

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,970
stopped a Qunari server we'll come to

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,040
that in a second a Kannada server in the

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:30,120
background with a Kannada control you

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,250
run our kannadi FSCJ a Kannada check

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,230
while it's running you can run a Kannada

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,560
control vacuum that's sort of like text

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,050
as I understood it packs the uh kannadi

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,150
database then you restart contact it

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,300
maybe even restart KDE or reboot the

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:47,730
machine just to get a plain playing

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,190
field it's not the way we usually do but

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,440
I've learned this may be helpful also

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,140
because constant updates the rolling

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,670
release been delayed and you don't know

00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,770
if it's just because from all the

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,160
libraries are still in the memory being

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,520
used somewhere or kernel is updated or

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,520
whatever

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:13,409
you have a recreate index function in

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:16,370
the folder the folders Earth and menu

00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:18,929
you can unsubscribe from this folder

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,029
locally there's local subscriptions and

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,039
server-side subscriptions so if you

00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:26,279
unsubscribe and subscribe again this

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,839
will make contact rebuild the cache for

00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,750
this folder if there's something wrong

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,330
in the cache and you can use a Kannada

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,460
console to recreate the IMF cache

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,850
- I will show you these things within

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,320
with short screenshots and you should

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,299
check with another machine if it's not a

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,429
problem of time observer of course yeah

00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:48,570
if all of this fails you've got a

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:53,490
problem so here's a Kannada control or a

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:55,830
Kannada CTL most important features are

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:59,129
the commands at the beginning start stop

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:03,029
restart status and then vacuum and fsck

00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:05,789
I never used instances I never had to

00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:08,490
use it this is what it does see did you

00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:10,019
see in the middle so these are

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,559
screenshots that I took during the last

00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,240
days when some things went wrong and I

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,190
thought okay I can use this screenshot

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,730
for the speech for the presentation

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:24,870
maybe it's helpful so what you see here

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,980
is I did an akuna DFS check F Tech and

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:32,490
it's a a pair fault 53,000 external

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,440
files cleaning up missing external files

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,399
and any starts okay here's one thing

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,860
that is he misses an external file and

00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:43,379
but that's that's that's happening

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,090
regularly for me I don't know why if

00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:47,070
it's just because I have some sixteen

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,710
gigabyte of nails in in five accounts

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,779
and that this may be a setup that is not

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,210
that common for a Qunari for testing I

00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:56,639
don't know but it it keeps happening for

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,080
me and in most cases of Americans or

00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,220
control fsck

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,820
can fix that in my setup in most cases

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,820
but not always

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,450
you know when you set up an a an IMAP

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,010
account you have the choice between what

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,110
used to be called offline and online a

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,580
mine nowadays it's called something like

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,770
I using both of them

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,260
uh-huh and they work very differently

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,570
and actually the one that is most be

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,669
tested is nowadays default which is to

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:32,230
have a local cache yes the online I'm

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:36,250
having yeah I used the local cache as

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:39,010
standard and the Mail's online just for

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,470
my GroupWise server so they're GroupWise

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,110
server that's not really that doesn't

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,470
have many emails I used full mail

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,539
download as a standard because the the

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,750
way is well I'm not an iconic expert but

00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:54,580
I put my hands into it three times these

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,280
files are like attachments to your

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,240
emails so if it's online it doesn't

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,090
really matter gonna get them again it's

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,640
gonna get them again I haven't had any

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,809
consistent problems right that's also

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,409
why I said have a look at the mail

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:13,179
server if something is corrupted there

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,470
because it's a file is I also told it's

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,210
an external file must be an attachment

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,470
or something so I went on the nails over

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,179
from the different machine I could see

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,770
there are there is no afrinolly

00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:22,809
insurance all this is about Yolo called

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,820
cash anyway so if anything gets lost

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:27,250
it's in your local cache not on the main

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,429
server and yeah it's a canary right yeah

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,080
and if you have sincere doubt in your a

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:36,940
canary instance there is a tool that's

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,360
called a cannot eat test and it what it

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,280
does it is it creates a cache and a lot

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,070
of stuff and you have to be careful

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,140
because it will create this stuff in TMP

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,669
ID it's I guess some more mistakes in

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,590
that I did a mistake in there

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:52,150
this is era this is about running Union

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,510
tests I don't think it's gonna help you

00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:59,169
with your user problems it says in its

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,730
in its description that it's the tool

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,580
that the tool is there to test whether

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:08,500
you're a conadi setup is correct I don't

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:10,750
think that's what it is I filled my root

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,600
partition yesterday but did you see that

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:18,280
I I was running it and then I stopped it

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,050
and the second video is some ten minutes

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,690
later because

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,040
my system started to behave strangely

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,020
and then I found out that my root

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,790
partition was full because the team he

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,190
wasn't in a special partition it's a

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,140
laptop here and I found that there were

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,640
12 gigabyte okay of a Kannada test run

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,030
at the cache that did build up was 12

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,130
gigabyte big I don't know why but so

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:42,600
then I just said this was something that

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,590
I noticed yesterday we have another

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,930
thing that's Baloo

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,180
that's the successor to nipple book the

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,880
the search index the index of 4 the

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,160
search engine now and it's got some

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,580
interesting it's got this beautiful the

00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,340
same command status starts drop restored

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,830
and interesting is monitored because

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,510
indexing is a process you know it takes

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,130
a lot of resources it can take a lot of

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,990
time you can imagine that the 16

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,360
gigabyte of emails that I have take a

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,930
lot of time I've usually they have have

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,360
it run overnight for the indexing and

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,590
the monitor command is pretty

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,270
interesting because it gives you some

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,920
output about what's what's going on

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:25,170
right now so and the best tool which I

00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,630
must say it's capabilities are beyond my

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,970
reach the in terms of understanding

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,070
what's going on but the best debugging

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,650
tool is a Granada console this is also

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,050
where you can do the way you can make

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,030
the biggest mistakes and destroy things

00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,810
I assume that's why there is this

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:45,420
warning but you have a debugger with

00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:48,090
lots of detail and that's where I would

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:52,350
ask some developer if the other file

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,590
missing or whatever and mistakes persist

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,930
so you've got a debugger that you have

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,240
to activate all of this functions

00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,980
monitoring debugging and everything but

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,380
it's it's very helpful if you know what

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,540
you're doing you can also clear the

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,480
cache from here you can dump things to

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:12,990
XML and other things so you can really

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,960
sort of like low-level access and get

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,090
help for that for the server and now is

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,420
the hard way that's what I had to do

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:26,460
several times especially after then then

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:29,780
after KDE 4 and later stop a Qunari

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,250
remove the TMP files for a Qunari

00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,549
together that there is

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:38,279
and often some there used to be stuff

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:41,090
wrong in there and make have a Qunari do

00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:44,070
a claim have been a plane start yeah and

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,600
then I start a canary consul and contact

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,000
at the same time to see if I have any

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,440
troubles helped in some cases this is

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and this is what yeah this is a horrible

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:58,049
script as you can see that that that

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,120
sort of grew over the years to get for

00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:03,720
testing purposes and for Linux magazine

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:07,289
articles and for setups to get rid of

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,080
all prior settings around contact k deep

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:14,580
in K mail and a Qunari on my system so

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,159
what I did is I lots of lots of files in

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,830
a variety of places that aren't correct

00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,509
anymore today but that's that was a

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,879
script I made this a script because I

00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:27,720
needed it that often it says a lot I

00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:29,129
think I wanted to put this disclaimer

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,169
here the dangers of file deletion

00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:33,179
because I will give you the butt paths

00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:38,269
where stuff is in and config files are

00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:42,659
in I'll be done in just three slides um

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:44,309
you may lose all local changes that have

00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,500
not been synced to your server if you

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:46,889
delete and mess with economy cache and

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,350
files

00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:54,240
that's a given it's just normal and then

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,940
work around copy recent variants to

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,450
local mail folder before proceeding that

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,580
mostly works so copy the Mail's from the

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,129
last day tool to the local mail folder

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,019
and then mess with a cannot e because

00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:09,090
you still have to see this the secure

00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,710
State on the IMAP server so then that's

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,710
what I learned I can delete all of it

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,539
and give it a fresh start and then copy

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,620
the Mail's it has that I tried to send

00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:21,450
or that I send the last days in there

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,730
what's more big is that you lose all the

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,710
settings all those wonderful performer

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,110
settings for example because the folders

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,360
have a name but they also have a hash or

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,429
a string in the configuration files it's

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,559
a number as far as I remember and they

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,710
are identified by the number so contact

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,269
gets irritated by that the sent folder

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,720
will suddenly be a completely different

00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:44,390
folder it's not that it's doesn't find a

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,850
folder but you just use a

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,930
I haven't found out why and the same

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:52,850
applies to draft and templates and but

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,560
for all the other folders you will just

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,150
lose the settings because the folder

00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:03,740
doesn't exist anymore so you have to set

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:06,110
it up again and yeah there is quite a

00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,760
number that can be quite awkward some

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,740
steps that can be automated like I did

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,690
with the other script and some things

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,450
some config files can just be copied

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,880
back and forth also when you setup a new

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,400
machine like identities or mail

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,260
transports that make your life easier so

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,030
you don't need to to enter the mail

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:27,380
server again if you don't want to use

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:29,780
the wizard and this is my current state

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,410
of the directories and files that are

00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:35,570
being used by a kannadi and contact if

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:39,290
if you have a look that there should be

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:41,480
at least on my tumbleweed system its

00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:44,240
cache a kannadi that's the a Qunari

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,700
cache so if if you delete it with with a

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,670
Kannada console huh that's where this

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:53,030
happens if you do an RM RF in this

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,770
directory you just pull the cache away

00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,810
from our Kannada and it asked if but it

00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:02,450
will recreate it automatically when it

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:06,290
starts again with the problems of folder

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,690
names I don't know what exactly is in

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:13,490
TMP a Qunari but it can be a lot

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:18,170
it's the temporary files and on my on my

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:20,870
desktop machines I have this as a temp

00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,630
temp FS in a large tempest file so it

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:25,040
will be automatic deleted on reboot as I

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,420
mentioned if you if you stop running a

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,610
Kannada test because it's not meant for

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,310
end users the only thing you'll find in

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,960
TMP equality is a socket for mysql and

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,840
that's about it there is really just

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,220
like four tiny ones there are zero size

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,740
files because there are circuits that's

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,870
all varies in TMP yes and everything

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,060
else was the crap from well how enough

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,460
did that could there be twelve gigabyte

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,830
when I run out of Kannada test okay if

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,180
that's the only case that there might be

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,220
but I can access is supposed to be used

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,390
from the unit test framework and then

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,220
it's probably is set up with different

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,800
parameters than what you do by just

00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,929
running it yourself

00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,030
it's supposed to do that but if you

00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:03,340
don't do that then it's really just okay

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,340
so good fine so then we have config

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,620
files we have the main mail storage in

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,390
local share a Qunari yeah we have the

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,130
index of the desktop search engine in

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,920
local share below and we have the local

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:20,260
mail in local mail folders folders

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:22,059
correct obviously so I'm I am done now I

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,010
just wanted to give you some sources of

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:26,500
information I think we should be Esqueda

00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:29,290
you should do something there but this

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,140
is a good start and so I'm ready for

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:34,240
questions if there is time left we don't

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:39,490
have much time but if there's one small

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,350
short question is a short answer and I'm

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,809
I wanted just one more disclaimer

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,850
another developer I'm not a coder I've

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,790
been a user since before or something

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:51,429
like 20 years and I only filed I think

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,830
one single bug in this whole realm

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,660
because with the systems that I've been

00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,610
using and especially with tumbleweed

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,420
most of the bugs get fixed faster than I

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:05,440
could file one in my experience with the

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:07,420
Microsoft Exchange plugin it works only

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,000
when you initialize it and for the

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,320
calendar only works read-only but if you

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,710
reboot the system it doesn't work

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,170
anymore okay ever okay that's my

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,150
experience and that was a few months

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:23,470
maybe a year ago okay I'm hoping is

00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,570
better now haven't tried it yet have you

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,130
tried it recently no I just came across

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,690
it this week and I just learned this

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,150
week that there is a new one I hadn't

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,220
expected it I just came also just came

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,470
across it because colleagues of mine had

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,179
used evolution with an exchange

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,470
connector and it failed or has big

00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:40,929
troubles since the last update that

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,390
Microsoft did in July 17 or something

00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:50,200
like that so that's only why I came

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:53,020
across it at all so you mentioned those

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,970
same rules the filter rules and I didn't

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,280
quite understand this is a local feature

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,290
of contact that is to just a certain

00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,860
protocol to communicate with a certain

00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:05,710
mail server it's a front end - ah yes

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,590
it's a front end a local editor with

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,309
syntax check that

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:14,009
uses this sieve protocol to put down a

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,990
file a case file on the server it's

00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:19,100
still server-side okay it's server-side

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:24,600
filtering this is just the GUI to use it

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:27,809
behind you know if no time always a

00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,950
person asked later one on thank you for

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,950
a presentation thank you

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,060
