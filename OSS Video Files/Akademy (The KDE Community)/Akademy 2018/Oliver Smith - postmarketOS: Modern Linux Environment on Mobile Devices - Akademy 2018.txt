Title: Oliver Smith - postmarketOS: Modern Linux Environment on Mobile Devices - Akademy 2018

Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	postmarketOS is a Linux-based operating system for mobile devices with a focus on freedom, security and sustainability.

Instead of building an operating system from scratch, we're reusing well-tried standards and code from the Unix desktop ecosystem, while still providing a user friendly experience.

We're working closely together with the KDE project on bringing Plasma Mobile, one of the several user interface choices in postmarketOS, to as many devices as possible.
