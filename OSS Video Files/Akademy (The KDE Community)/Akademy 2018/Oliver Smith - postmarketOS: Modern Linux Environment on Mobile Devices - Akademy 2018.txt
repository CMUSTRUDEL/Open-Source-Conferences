Title: Oliver Smith - postmarketOS: Modern Linux Environment on Mobile Devices - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	postmarketOS is a Linux-based operating system for mobile devices with a focus on freedom, security and sustainability.

Instead of building an operating system from scratch, we're reusing well-tried standards and code from the Unix desktop ecosystem, while still providing a user friendly experience.

We're working closely together with the KDE project on bringing Plasma Mobile, one of the several user interface choices in postmarketOS, to as many devices as possible.

today too because we knew and we have to

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,870
so why do we go that is probably what's

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,860
wrong with Android I have a three-part

00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,050
step first of all the Android Open

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,210
Source Project iOS PSP right is

00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,110
developed behind closed curtains so they

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,720
to get out with the binary release that

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,940
of course makes it hard to forge the

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,300
code because whenever you will need to

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,300
rebase you can only be based after they

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,540
released the code and then you always

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,860
run behind and of course the stock

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,620
Android version you can use has

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:31,020
proprietary components that's not so

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,910
nice and I have a whole list of monkian

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,970
one important thing is you have a lot of

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,620
tracking in the default setup so I

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,290
experienced this myself because I

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,570
installed the stock Android lady and it

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,320
took me about an hour to go through all

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,110
the sessions and there was something

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,360
particularly nasty because I wasn't the

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,850
permissions menu and I disabled

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,580
everything like access to contacts and

00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:04,209
storage and microphone and everything

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:05,950
and then modify system settings and some

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,070
apps which we installed by default

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,850
headers to add this enabled by default

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:16,750
and just meant everything I said in here

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,989
are young men you just was recently so I

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,700
went back and checked it and it's it's

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,260
really not user friendly so I had to

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,690
turn this setting off as well and then

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,150
go back to the permissions and then turn

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:33,040
off everything again and only after that

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:36,250
it seems like it was so they are really

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,620
trying to get all this access and they

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,730
are not really caring about the users it

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,700
seems famous for the for the entrance

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,410
there are a lot of applications in there

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,970
they were just trying to display your

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,430
advertisements all the time

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,799
for example there are games where you

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,540
have to turn the screen and when you

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,310
lose the game they show a big

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,080
advertisement right in the spot where

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,030
you need to tap the screen so you type

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,239
it again and it opens in your browser

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,280
and the window of the game gave some

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,390
money and you are just frustrated but

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,840
you keep on playing because it's

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,840
addictive

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,940
comparing this to just administer

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,980
tribution and you won't find any of that

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,450
down so that's my standard basically

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,870
yeah and as I said I have a whole list

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,610
here a bit pointless you have two years

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,110
of support and that's the maximum or

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,990
sometimes you don't have as much support

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,330
and yeah of course the security issues

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,320
for example stage fright the one video

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,650
devices vulnerable at least and you

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,100
won't see any pictures for that

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,320
so yeah let's move on there is a Freud

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,020
replicant monitor s and helium of course

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,810
and I think these are excellent projects

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,090
but they only fix the symptoms and not

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,240
the root cause and they will always have

00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,660
this up a balloon whenever a rebase that

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,490
takes time and everything here's a

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,729
speech out from the language literature

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:11,729
I think you pronounce it project and you

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:15,990
can see that and 96 people maintaining

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:18,030
those and this isn't really possible so

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,250
point emphasis you have all these

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,419
content repositories for example because

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,910
each has their own repository from the

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:32,520
and they are all they all have security

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:36,300
issues so that's not so nice this is not

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,139
sustainable and institutions don't have

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,740
these problems

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:45,710
so let's Bend our Linux distribution to

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,240
replace Android how do we do this well

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,520
first of all you need to install a lot

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,590
of packages on the Linux distribution

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,750
from there we went to install to the

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,639
phone and it turns out of course on

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,760
Linux distributions the packages have

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,310
different names so it's not it's not

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,840
really you can't really make a

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,200
step-by-step guide that works on every

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,599
distribution and also the forms

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,910
themselves they require different

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,860
learning applications and even

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,570
the same flashing application like fast

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,460
food for example you sometimes need

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,640
especially when device that need to be

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,920
sent to the device so all in all it's a

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,880
big mess and there is no standard way to

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,970
do it all so what happens was a bunch of

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,620
shakespeare's valley and eventually they

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,400
turned it to the paint program TM

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,200
bootstrap now what does program does is

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,410
set up multiple change modes for

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,780
bleeding and flashing and if you use the

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,860
seekers and this ECU some clever hacks

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,960
to make it fast and the flashing is

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,470
obstructed with a simple commands that

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,600
work for other devices also you have

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,350
almost zero dependency so you can just

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,030
clone it from github and get started

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,310
the only things you need is Part III or

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:09,870
messes island voyages and this is almost

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,060
installed on all Linux distributions and

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,100
it's also easy to research these change

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,800
routes and of course and you can easily

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,180
reproduce any issues you might have so

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
people only does small distribution them

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,720
if you are going to use change routes

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,230
who knows which distribution again you

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:34,620
think yeah thank you

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:36,570
yeah right it's a fun yes and the basic

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,990
solution choice of f1 is just six

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:42,330
megabytes so it's really small this

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,200
strategy this model of the busybox of

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,810
our C and D play in an April and

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,090
typically from from Ed - not the same as

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,050
from Android of concerts a bit confusing

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:57,000
maybe and they have stable and rolling

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,860
releases also which is very useful

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,020
because when you find you don't want to

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,020
have fun in release all the time at then

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,410
maybe you're working on something you

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,860
want to have stable stuff eventually

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:14,250
any terms of package when this decision

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,970
was made thoughts here at the company

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,419
store I promise you

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:23,569
pictures of money better

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,930
all right here are the rules we have so

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:29,560
these are basically the mine starts to

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:33,680
give you an idea of the project

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,959
developed and this is the first post it

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,070
was called any 5-10 year lifecycle for

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:43,099
smartphones on the 26th of May 2013 we

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,850
had to put advisors one contributor does

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,700
yours truly and the nature of kernels

00:08:46,850 --> 00:09:00,079
very used at this point good truck was

00:08:49,700 --> 00:09:02,329
released and we had and we had it

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:10,220
running without or the Android user

00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:12,200
space which at the time they're using 50

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,779
days later we had eight booting devices

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,170
in another age but rescue - certainly

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:20,060
contributors 2000 on Android device and

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,070
the first one with Wi-Fi working it's

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:29,510
the Samsung i-90 7 0 just was dumped

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,550
right on yellow money and in that motor

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:45,800
guide somewhat it's allowed to quickly

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:48,709
in to new parts of the its own so

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,230
musically just was done by Martine and

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:55,100
he's part of the guy who did a lot of to

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:58,490
I'm using the presentation so another 50

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,220
Jensen HIV has 70 booting devices 27

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,960
contributors and the first time we had

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,780
got more mobile and children rocking

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,300
actually so you know plasma obviously

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,110
and third is the desktop which one on

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,120
the device I just showed you the n900

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:17,090
and it is 20/20 we're running both in

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,030
queue and you and also we had the a

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,890
droid become a recently supported that

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,960
you can see on the left and just was

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:37,070
done by a phenom solutely yeah here's a

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:40,190
short video so it's a bit buggy the work

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,980
of this was done by Rodriguez and we had

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,380
a lot of fun push on shark also and we

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,310
even were able to use ke purchase from

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,590
Michael Knight who was what's up

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,990
wheezing develop thicknesses to make

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,990
Katie Ibrahim as and remember

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:14,360
yeah we used affected so yes kind of

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:22,420
pick we right now we have about hundred

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:22,420
pictures next night here's okay

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,530
at least I kind of pretty close to it

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:31,660
it's 4.12 and the device originally came

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:36,370
with our 2.6 or something Karnas oh

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,960
please step ahead just was done by this

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,620
once built depending on the work by a

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,370
paucity of ice you and Marsha and a lot

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,370
of other counters

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,060
we had 42 booting devices 57

00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,360
contributors and the other a lot of you

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:04,330
is running on actual phones this time

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:06,820
including Western and accessories for

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,430
and this is what the collaboration

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,290
between many developers as you can see

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:28,570
from the days we kind of did this in the

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:32,590
many days because project so we had some

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:35,860
one year experience at two tablet this

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:39,400
was done by trade tender and it's very

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:42,070
close to mainline as well and the

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,160
graphics stack is done with we do in the

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,560
user space so again we don't need to use

00:12:45,160 --> 00:13:04,510
Android Traverse we can use a free

00:12:47,560 --> 00:13:08,470
software implementation this is sorry

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,770
kirigami UI which is katie is framework

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,670
for responsive applications that look

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:19,000
good on mobile as well of the desktop

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:22,350
and yeah here's Craig playing with some

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,350
people as you can

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,649
it was called one year of cosmic rays

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,830
may night for me and we had 84 boutique

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:36,850
devices 106 contributors and yes the

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,930
Nexus 5 using senator Monning from CLIA

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,430
on Manhattan

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,730
here's the Nexus 5 on the left and it's

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,920
Firefox and we had a my data guys so

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,680
even people who don't really know about

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,160
connecting can now look at our D key and

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,430
can figure out how they can get started

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,680
with make money on keywords and the idea

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,209
of the guidance of course kinda hanging

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,990
is not that easy but we have some

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:13,990
experts like Trek who is willing to help

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:18,010
a few running the 49:17 out his recon

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,760
under nexus 5 and this was done by a

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:25,480
worker from Bhushan zone then continued

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:31,570
by Yonatan Merrick and also created a

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:34,540
lot and you can see cellular motive

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,760
modem signal strength display plasma

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,279
motor so as you can see the we can talk

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,370
to the cellular modem also without

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,770
running any Android code and the user

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:52,089
space which was a great achievement and

00:14:46,770 --> 00:15:06,430
even a focus on devices Android OS and

00:14:52,089 --> 00:15:06,940
you can see it executes JavaScript all

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,209
right

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,880
I mentioned butch back to it you might

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:15,400
want to know how to use it as I

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,910
mentioned the setup is pretty easy you

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:22,399
just run it flow from the and then you

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,639
run

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,550
it's groups basically and if we ask you

00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,490
some questions like which device do you

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:36,069
want to part and which you only want to

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,069
have that small or something else and

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:56,540
everything and everything so it's just

00:15:42,550 --> 00:16:04,910
basically afterwards you can technically

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:08,389
and finally do and you can also read it

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,089
in queue a few days so you would start

00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:14,329
it again without for disk encryption and

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:16,160
yeah I didn't mention it yet which can

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:23,029
use for disk encryption and even after

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:28,399
spoke you you and that's it

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:29,959
execute or qmu instance the postmark

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,199
doors running and you don't get to

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,990
specify parameters as you usually need

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:41,029
my first image and everything this arc

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:43,399
goes automatically no you might also

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:45,800
wonder how you would modify include

00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,939
negative two packages are the same git

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,790
repository so you just used your

00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:55,480
favorite editor and start editing these

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:59,629
packaged foods yes the ones for Haven

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,459
from KDE and after you had modified it

00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:02,990
possibly change the sources that he

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,319
would run the texture command sort of

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:09,439
told us the sausage again it refreshes

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:14,390
check songs basically antenna campus

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:17,270
also was one line we also have some

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,920
variations for building so if you want

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:25,720
across the whole package she was

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:28,580
say - - arch is on hf and that's it

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,830
and you can even specify a different

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,680
stock order so if you have cable

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,070
check out locally and you want to do

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,810
some peeling edge measures hanging on it

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:42,650
you will use this syntax and you can of

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:46,420
course combine those and then it is what

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:49,820
you stems directly from your source tree

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,820
so how does the big recipe in look like

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:56,210
it's pretty simply simular to watch

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,300
peanuts actually it looks like a lot of

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,500
things but most of it is just variables

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:07,250
describing the dependencies description

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,200
and the actual good stuff if you don't

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:15,470
see this email automatically and there's

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:17,840
a point of support and security so it's

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,420
not that complicated it's really easy to

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,850
contribute I think and you can even

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:28,910
generate those with bootstrapping if you

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:31,750
watch alright so yeah it's it's almost

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:36,640
like obviously so it's really not much

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:40,070
so thanks to all the contributors who

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,740
brought this to you and thank you for

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,809
listening everyone and please

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,809
[Music]

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,020
[Applause]

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:26,380
what are you here and so the big picture

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,540
is of course getting a daily driver

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,750
working that you can use post-market OS

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:35,950
on your device every day but as we are

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,590
doing this in our free time we don't

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:44,050
have a strict schedule so we work with

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:48,309
whoever contributes and who has and from

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,440
KDE where Bhushan is already helping on

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,710
what I think

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,570
yeah maybe as more people tried it out

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,950
contributed more maybe developed some

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,950
else with Kirito

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:17,000
in the 90s we had nine clear monopoly on

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,200
the mainframe different area okay and

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,980
this peoples and IBM and the European

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,070
Union force IBM to own a platform which

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,280
depend - don't touch me other companies

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,760
and now very simple solutions with

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,110
Android Android also is monopoly in some

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,900
areas and the you know just to define on

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:47,720
Google multibillion fine because they

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:50,660
are and I also see the aspect for all

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,300
the environments are bad that you are

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,450
definitely forced to buy most cases

00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,850
before two videos because the ger

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,270
typically is calculated from the day

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,580
when the issue of release a new phone

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:09,350
listen could you saw something like with

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:11,510
ten twelve months and at the end of the

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,610
life cycle so they will only have two

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,420
patches for like the back twelve months

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:21,650
or so and it was increasing risk also on

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,720
society in growing unrest tones and so

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm wondering if we should go for

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:31,270
political side and maybe the NDA

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,250
we minion to ask for this environmental

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,130
reason for general security reason set

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:40,060
for Business Week which is about pieces

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:42,310
of that if the company's decides to

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,700
abandon the devices don't want them

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,410
anymore

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,690
we'll provide especially security fixes

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,450
that they are forced to at the

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,480
specification and maybe in some cases

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,060
also open opted primary member so that

00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,150
you can run for them to brag on new free

00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:04,240
software of course yeah a good fighter

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,670
maybe we can get to that yes this would

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,540
be really great actually and I didn't

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,270
know about you European Union

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:17,860
complaining but it's right it's of an

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:20,380
idea and yeah I also think we we need to

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,130
do something about this this huge waste

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:27,600
from the three years of the port and

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,600
yeah the best case would be

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,510
[Music]

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,890
[Music]

00:22:52,310 --> 00:23:13,990
phone please send them our way

00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:17,780
we can also yeah I would like that and

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:31,910
second question would you recommend it's

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:35,600
also for somebody looking for yes think

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:40,510
you can do with as you can just use it

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:44,290
as a zero evidence device so you can

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,290
transform your own phone

00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:08,029
so you were saying if if you would

00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:18,889
recommend it to put it on development

00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:20,869
box basically okay it shows yeah the

00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:23,419
project process is really easy so even

00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:25,609
if you only have to amend O'Connor only

00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:27,859
improve infrastructure is in place you

00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:29,929
just probably want a guy in the inner

00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:31,690
stuff I mentioned oh yeah you saying I

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:37,579
want a new device type in the name and

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:40,279
then you can add URL to the cognitive

00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:42,969
code and then you have a new device

00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:46,059
package and it's you can run it on your

00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:50,200
ability possible yeah

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,200
so technically come here

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:20,309
okay so thank you the children okay

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,309
[Music]

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:13,250
well we have to take it furniture so we

00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,840
don't have a fancy UI or something but

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,750
basically you can come out to the

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,350
command line and say apk update after

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,210
that you get your packages and we have a

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,190
script with you but need to call

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:35,240
manually that also updates to come but

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:37,010
it's not smoothly integrated yes but

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,260
that's I think there's a feature because

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,690
if you have a whole system image then we

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,550
can treat the modifier in system as much

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,120
time to be support a bunch of your eyes

00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:49,580
and then we will need to provide a new

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,160
system image for each device for each UI

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:56,920
so better have a lot of packages and

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,920
very small device specific

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:03,460
I'm not sure I understood everything

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,080
so we're saying if we want to access all

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,430
the send loss without Android driver

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:13,330
yeah and you look space okay so we're

00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:15,430
that's that's yeah why not

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,940
as long as support is there in the

00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,560
corner basically and we have some maybe

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,190
free software you know space product and

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,900
why not so I think that's so I don't see

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,110
why anybody would not want to have to

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,110
see yeah

00:28:34,350 --> 00:29:06,960
so yeah

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,220
