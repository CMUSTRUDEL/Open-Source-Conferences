Description: 
	Wikipedia stands for free knowledge, encyclopedias in the 21st century, and the power of collaboration. But can Wikipedia also become a symbol for a welcoming online community which celebrates diversity and inclusion? If Wikipedia wants to live up to its vision to share the sum of all knowledge, we will need to be open for those whose knowledge is not adequately represented yet.

The talk covers some of the challenges that Wikimedia organisations encounter in facilitating such a cultural change, how they deal with it and some learnings which might be of interest for KDE's own goals regarding the onboarding of newcomers.
