Title: Keynote Speaker: Claudia Garad - W for Welcome - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	Wikipedia stands for free knowledge, encyclopedias in the 21st century, and the power of collaboration. But can Wikipedia also become a symbol for a welcoming online community which celebrates diversity and inclusion? If Wikipedia wants to live up to its vision to share the sum of all knowledge, we will need to be open for those whose knowledge is not adequately represented yet.

The talk covers some of the challenges that Wikimedia organisations encounter in facilitating such a cultural change, how they deal with it and some learnings which might be of interest for KDE's own goals regarding the onboarding of newcomers.

thank you thank you Oh

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,100
better to start off with a little

00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,350
applause thanks for having me um I feel

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,960
very honored to be here and able to

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,900
speak about one of my favorite topics

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,480
today with you with another community

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,480
that has a lot to offer like my talking

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,489
to Lydia before and I read a lot about

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,130
what you're doing and I find it pretty

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:39,190
intriguing and so thanks for having me

00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,470
I'm Claudia cava I'm the executive

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,020
director of Wikimedia Austria which is

00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,870
the local chapter of the Vicki verse so

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,480
we support the volunteers that work for

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,850
Wikipedia and her sister project in

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,500
Austria I mainly we work closely

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,350
together with Wikimedia Germany where

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,110
little girls for example and the Central

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,330
and Eastern European communities on the

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,780
other side so this is where I come from

00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:07,210
business what I do and I'm here today to

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,759
talk a bit about the welcoming culture

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,909
and our projects and the Wikimedia

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,530
projects and perhaps the one or the

00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,390
other idea or one of the other things

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,249
that we learn the last couple of years

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,319
so we try it might also be interesting

00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,939
for you because as I heard like one or

00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,369
two or three goals is onboarding

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:27,340
newcomers and I think welcoming culture

00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:33,100
and newcomers need to go together

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,749
very well so Wikipedia I think everybody

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,380
in this room knows what Wikipedia is

00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:37,810
right

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,619
so I don't have to ask this question so

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,210
if we see this iconic W this is what

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,039
antique repeat for us is what the

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,289
enpsychopedia and nowadays looks like

00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,429
it's some our version of what used to be

00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:51,280
the pork house in the german-speaking

00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:55,000
world or the Encyclopedia Britannica and

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
the Anglophone world before it's a

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,450
website where everybody can access

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,369
knowledge at anytime on their mobile

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,869
phones on their computers and I don't

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,640
have to say that to you because your

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,259
community yourself but to many people I

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,209
talk to it's actually a kind of a

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,090
surprise that this is not just a website

00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:16,450
with some content that comes from

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,489
somewhere but it's actually why more

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,099
than that it's a community or even more

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,830
a network of communities because every

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,709
language Wikipedia has their own little

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,209
sub culture sub community and then there

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,420
are all the sister projects like wiki

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:35,380
data like wikivoyage like Wikimedia

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,569
Commons and what brings all these people

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,180
together is to believe that knowledge

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,680
belongs to all of us and that not only

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,750
means that it belongs to all of us in

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,000
the sense that we can access it for free

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,100
at any time anywhere like to have free

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,900
educational content for everybody but

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,790
also that we are all agents of knowledge

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,709
all of us carrying knowledge and we are

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,470
all should be part of the creation of

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,239
knowledge it's not only the ivory tower

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,940
as it used to be for so many years or

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,269
some scientists or experts say what what

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,340
is this that is for of a given topic but

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,270
each and any of us can contribute to

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,220
that and this is what

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:16,640
it's the way we create and consume

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:18,620
knowledge nowadays the Big W with that

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,260
is also symbol for what's actually

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,560
possible in the online age where a lot

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,750
of the promises that were inherent and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
the birth of Internet actually came true

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,110
and like one of it and this is also

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,180
something that the ecology don't have to

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,520
tell you but for many who have never

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,520
lifted the curtains and look behind the

00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,350
Wikipedia universe it's the power of

00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,660
decentralized collaboration that it's

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,390
actually possible to create something

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,430
like Wikipedia without any formal

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,560
structure or hierarchy that people just

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,160
work together and form this body of

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,500
knowledge and that's actually pretty

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,780
beautiful like for me that's one of the

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,790
biggest social experiments of mankind in

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,580
a way I don't think we ever had like a

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,800
global experiment to that extent where

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,600
we have so many different people from so

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,770
many different backgrounds working

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,630
together for one goal and the issue with

00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,090
it is that actually like we are also

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,980
lacking the series to explain how and

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,840
why that's actually possible and even

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,480
people have been working in the wiki

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,260
world for many many years yes use of our

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,260
for example

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,139
at least cause of loss of Wikipedia the

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,910
problem was Wikipedia's that it can only

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,400
work in practice in theory it would

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,050
never work so relaxing the motivational

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,600
theories that say like why would people

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,870
and numerously without any gain for

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,330
their reputation or without any money or

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,460
or any other or like classical of

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,139
incentives put so much time and effort

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,400
into creating something like Wikipedia

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,720
we just have the sociological

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,460
motivational organizational theories

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,930
that come with it so I'm even for us

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,539
it's still a mystery how it exactly

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,349
works but it's a beautiful mystery to

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:00,349
explore every day

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,919
so there's this a laser people like one

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,680
of the few places unfortunately in the

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,449
internet and in my regard or in my view

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,130
where we actually come together to

00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,289
create where we not only passive

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,460
consumers who want to be entertained who

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:22,280
wanted to be served information but we

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,720
actually come together to also create

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,340
information and in the last couple of

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,780
years we realized that this is actually

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,169
becoming more and more important

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:34,860
Wikipedia the W becomes a symbol for

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,720
something try important and that is tech

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,729
based information like all the sudden

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,130
what many of us took for granted for

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:44,760
many years that information should be as

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,900
objective as possible should be source

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,229
and which should be a source with really

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,389
high quality sources became more and

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,389
more of a disputable issue of a

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,220
settlement so a lot of other platforms

00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,810
start turning to the kathiria and the

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,570
Wikipedia

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,389
Unity's to see what we learned in the

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,419
last almost 18 years when it comes to

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,880
creation of knowledge about dealing with

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,470
sources about dealing with information

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
on the Internet

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,430
because all the sudden becomes harder

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,830
and harder for other social media

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,470
platforms and others to actually provide

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:26,480
exactly that reliable information and

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,389
even more so we have view and fear

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,750
places where our whole IT world news

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,669
actually needs and this is Fleck for me

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,950
one of the big pieces of Wikipedia that

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,650
this is one of the few spaces where

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,900
these filter bubbles as they often call

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,270
it actually need have to meet and have

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,400
to negotiate a common truth like or at

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,040
least a common understanding of the

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,130
truth because we have people from all

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,580
specters of the political universe of

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,320
philosophy philosophical topics and they

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,770
need to come together on the four pages

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,410
of the wikis and negotiate like what is

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,570
the common denominator that makes it to

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,140
the article and then what in what way

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:11,419
and of course that can be quite ugly in

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,070
some in some instances I'm not saying

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,500
it's all always civilized the Knights

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,590
but it's possible and there are like

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,780
really nice and implemented studies

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,060
especially from the Anglophone world and

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,979
p.m. English Wikipedia but I think it's

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,200
true for many other language versions

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,780
too that you can see the more people

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,100
work together to create the Wikipedia

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,440
article the less bias they have

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,120
language so you can see that it does

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,700
something to people if they are forced

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,560
to negotiate to talk to each other to

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,330
listen to each other and to come to a

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,340
common conclusion on what makes it to

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,600
the article and one what not and this is

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,220
like so important and so rare nowadays

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,760
because if you look at I don't know any

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,520
given news outlet and at the the

00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,410
comments section below an article it's

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:05,240
it's usually just an ugly downward

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:08,430
spiral of insults and and toxic behavior

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,960
that doesn't lead anywhere so this is

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,280
this is important that we have places

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,450
like that and there should be more it

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,210
should not only be we keep the other

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,350
fifty more places that get out there so

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,820
all that to say um of course

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,010
improvements that might drop is

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,720
important that our community that is

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,600
important and it's nice to talk about

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,670
like how wonderful we are but these are

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,140
like not the only conversation should we

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,120
should have been probably also not the

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,890
most important conversation we should

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,630
have the most important conversation we

00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,120
should have is like where do we still

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,860
fail like where where are our blind

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,570
spots like what are we not doing right

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,070
what do we need to do to actually live

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,480
up to the promise or certain future and

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,880
if we look at our own mission statement

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,160
this is something that Jimmy Wales the

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,050
co-founder of yes that years ago and I

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,910
think it's one of the few things that

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,740
almost all volunteers would actually

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,960
subscribe to a lot of things are

00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,340
debatable but I think this the sentence

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,220
imagine a world in which every single

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,990
human being can really share the sum of

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,430
all knowledge that's our commitment I

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,150
think that's something that most of us

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,950
don't subscribe to but after thinking

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,850
about it put just one or two minutes

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,319
it's already like oh wait a second

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,319
we're not there yet like we're actually

00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:21,039
very apart from it because as some of

00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:23,859
you might know the Vicki versus some a

00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,089
very homogenous place it's not the most

00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:27,399
stable place on earth

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,729
so we are far from having every single

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,129
human being there and we also have from

00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:34,959
actually enabling these people if they

00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,809
wanted to come to actually participate

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,579
and this is a big problem because if we

00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,499
want Wikipedia a free knowledge in

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:45,339
whatever form being admitted data the

00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:48,489
future of how we access pre knowledge to

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,679
survive and and be this this beautiful

00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:52,869
place out there in the internet we need

00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,899
more people we need fresh people we need

00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:58,419
more people from all over the world and

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,939
at the moment this is like not really

00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:03,309
possible and I'm just talking from my

00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:06,269
own experience um as a executive

00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:09,220
director of a fairly successful

00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:11,319
wikimedia organization which have high

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,229
approval rates in our unique community

00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,819
service I just read the other day again

00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:18,009
that people are concerned that somebody

00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:20,529
from outside the beekeepers is leading

00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:22,629
this organization this after six years

00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,100
that I am not only committed out of my

00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:26,229
professional time but also a lot of

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,799
private time like I only added in my

00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:32,379
spare private time because everything

00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,509
else that paid editing I need to hear

00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:37,059
that I'm still being perceived as being

00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,460
outside of whatever definition of

00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,680
corporate airs

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,330
and okay that commutes a job I signed up

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,790
to it I have to keep up with a couple of

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,830
things so this is fine but if I would be

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,540
a volunteer I would seem twice what I

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,430
want to spend another six you're doing

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,340
that if people say something like that

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,600
about and we have to sum these issues

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,520
with a lot of fun

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,080
different situation where people come

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,380
into the wiki words either online or

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,380
offline and encounter difficulties

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:08,580
barriers socially or technically so they

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:12,390
actually not able to work with us on

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,850
this mission statement so it's the Big W

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,580
also W that stands for welcome or not

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,160
like if we look at our own definition

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,960
that we have out there a velcome is a

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,940
kind of greeting designed to introduce a

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,450
person to a new place or situation and

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,250
make them feel at ease the term can

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,700
similarly also be used to describe a

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,050
feeling of being accepted of heart on

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,570
the part of the new person

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,250
so do we actually accomplish that making

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,670
people accept it as heart about

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,390
community and or feel at ease I don't

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,060
think so

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,980
and talking to newcomers over the last

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,150
year's whenever with them I don't think

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,980
so and even people have been

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,530
contemplating for many years and um

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,240
coming to international events often

00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,620
feel lost like if they don't come as

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,200
part of a group like you're the single

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,360
only Bulgarian that can come to

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,010
Wikimania you can be pretty lost like

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,839
and this is not because people are evil

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,670
but a lot of inside jokes

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,270
you probably don't speak English that

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:11,450
well you your pitch high like what's

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,790
happening like you can spend five days

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,160
together with your tribe and still not

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,740
being able to make the most out of it or

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,300
anything out of it really if the

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,070
conditions are not set up in a way to

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,050
enable you to actually contribute to

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,830
meet people to connect to people and to

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,740
do something with them and this is a

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,330
cultural problem so this is some one of

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,730
the hardest challenges that are out

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,710
there even for classical organizations

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,080
where you have like hierarchies and

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,640
challenge and then you have some kind of

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,160
leadership and they come up with like a

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,870
good strategy for tackling that

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,670
challenge and you try to do it and even

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,710
in these classical organizations there

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,870
goes to say culture eats strategy for

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,500
breakfast and it's so true like if you

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,910
don't really manage to do something

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,480
about the culture you can have the best

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,760
strategy work for whatever it will fail

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,280
and it's even harder for us because we

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,620
live in this be centralized world or all

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,200
these communities and we as chapters as

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,450
Wikimedia I don't actually have any

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,590
agency in the projects themselves we

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,660
don't make the rules they're that

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,460
they're made by the communities so our

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,650
framework affection is even more limited

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,930
than it is classical organizations so

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,710
it's tough but that should not keep us

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:28,400
from trying to do something the first

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:30,470
time becoming the Austria and I as a

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,380
responsible person there actually

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,330
started to think about it very

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,160
systematically and strategically was

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,130
when we hosted the Wikimedia hackathon

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,530
in Vienna last yeah so it's probably

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,260
very similar in many regards to what you

00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,730
guys doing on your events it's the time

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,030
here all the volunteers meet but also

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,830
the paid

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,140
no years of the Wikimedia Foundation to

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:55,590
come together and develop new tools to

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,480
improve media with he so it's a very

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,420
international event that slum also

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,670
diverse and we hosted it not only

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,160
because hosting events is so much fun

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,200
and we had so much time on our hands we

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,730
also had a goal we wanted to expand the

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,930
technical part of our communities

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,390
because the here in Austria we have a

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,090
lot of photographers and editors but we

00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,670
could use a couple of more tech say the

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,680
folks in our Austrian community so we

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,960
wanted to reach out to like-minded

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,430
communities here in Austria inviting to

00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,320
the hackathon and show them that there

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,210
might be you know common in common

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,330
things that it could work on it might be

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:33,390
worthwhile investing time in down in the

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,920
wiki worse and with all the experiences

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,690
we had before when you like this is not

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,730
happening by itself you can't just bring

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,650
people in and throw them together with

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,720
200 other people from all over the world

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,970
and hope that it's gonna work it works

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,530
to a couple people I'm not saying it's

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,730
not possible like they are outgoing

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,130
people who just you know

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,840
dive in and become part of it but we

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,610
can't take that for granted we need to

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,390
come up with like a more systematic

00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:00,930
approach on how we foster that and we

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,850
started to to think about it in many big

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,740
and small ways and because they were not

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,140
really good practices without it within

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,910
our communities we started to reach out

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,800
to other tech communities and see what

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:15,720
they been doing like rails girls

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,110
feminists tech circles in Vienna and

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,290
Austria human tact which is a use coding

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:25,140
initiative from Germany that's also done

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,240
in Switzerland and Austria and looked

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,790
into what they have in hand folks rules

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,620
like fears and tried to you know compile

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,720
the best things that we thought like

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,670
might make our events even better and we

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,210
had a lot of small and fix things like

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,890
gender neutral bathrooms or quiet zones

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,650
where people if they choose overwhelmed

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,150
from socializing can retreat and it's a

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,710
clear signal like if I'm here I don't

00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,080
want to be approached they need to an

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,210
hour or two to you know calm down and

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,480
have a bit of peace of mind before I can

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,960
go back into the big international

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,080
beehive of quarters so we had all these

00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,030
little things compiled it in there in a

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,660
handful the resources will be at the end

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:08,190
of my slides so you have something that

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,140
you might find useful for big or small

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,560
events you're hosting in new communities

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,270
or for one of the next academies but the

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,590
heart of what we actually did was a

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,910
mentoring program that we set up and

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,340
this was a mentoring product that that

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,200
really took that word mentoring very

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,280
seriously it was not just like hey and

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,630
that that's been because other things

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,120
have been done before we had body

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,370
systems were matching newcomers with all

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,540
hands and like and your buddies you have

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,780
fun together this weekend

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,460
go ahead that often that was nice that's

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,590
a start but often it didn't work because

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,900
after the initial getting to know each

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,430
other and exchanging of it it's it can

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,380
be a pretty high barrier if you see

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,520
you're both had badly working on

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:53,100
something really concentrated to go back

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,410
to women disturb them every 30 minutes

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,400
to ask him a question on like hey how do

00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,110
I set up that complicated task or

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,110
- fall party here failed like can you

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,940
help me so what we wanted to have this

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,040
mentors who actually came to the event

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,230
to be mentors and mentees only to

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,820
dedicate their time only to the

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,830
newcomers not working on their own

00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,690
projects but cameras a project that they

00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,970
work on but with the newcomers also

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,350
coming up with ideas because at least in

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,030
the wiki words I don't know about your

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,280
community but in the wiki words it's

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,960
really hard as a newcomer you have all

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,220
these opportunities and all these things

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,050
that you could do but it's completely

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,760
overwhelming you can spend the day just

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,110
researching like where to start and

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,450
where you can actually contribute to

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,950
have a group of mentors being there and

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,870
saying like this is my project this is

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,970
what we do this is a the skills that we

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,640
need do you want to work with me on that

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,870
that worked fairly well and also and

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,910
that something we learned from do you

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,710
saketram I learned a lot from that music

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,990
at one leg you always make that's only

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,150
for kids but it works for adults just as

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,800
much its how important is to have a

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,960
sense of accomplishment at the end of

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,940
tradition right like you spend three or

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,890
four days together you work hard and

00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,150
then you go home and there's just this

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,980
little thing that needs to be finished

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,360
or this or that and you probably will

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,820
never do it because you encounter

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,320
problems you're you're running out of

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,910
time so it's really important to have

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,100
something that you've accomplished and

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,410
can present at the end of the hackathon

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,210
in the showcase together with everybody

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,100
else that's that's one of the most

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,540
motivating things I think that you can

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,490
take

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,530
and we wanted to enable everybody we

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,600
wanted to do that to be able to do that

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,400
so it was the job of two mentors to make

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,260
sure that their team can accomplish

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,450
something and presented at the end of

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,820
the three days together with all the old

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,300
friends and dance in front of everybody

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,700
and be proud of something and show it

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,440
and that worked really well we also had

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,840
a program a mentoring program

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,090
coordinator to coordinate the mentors to

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,060
help them with to keep up sessions to

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,130
help them connect to each other during

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,410
the days have regular check-ins because

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,000
you encounter problems when you mentor

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,010
sometimes such as exchange was a

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,580
Dementors find other people with the

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,470
right skill set somewhere and have a

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,320
regular communication also between the

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,960
mentors over the three days and that

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,210
mean facilitated by a person that has

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,960
just this role to look that the program

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,700
itself is running about another

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,260
important thing that only popped up so

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,440
that something that we learned or we

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,840
find in process so to say during the

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,300
event was that it nice to have a

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,980
mentoring area because usually you have

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,230
to kick off session and people spread

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,580
out and work on their own or in the new

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,470
group so they come back together but

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,360
it's sometimes a big event hard to find

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,040
the person's back that you needed or

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,350
sometimes just anybody who can help you

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,940
so to have like this assigned area that

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,020
says like mentoring area that people who

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,450
are sitting there you can always

00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,740
approach them don't be shy come they

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,570
will be able to help you if they can

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,220
help you they probably know somebody who

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,740
can help you and help you find this

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,060
person approach this person so this was

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,710
also something that there's a wish from

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,480
from the mentees and that that's been

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,080
something that we had before our homes

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,840
ever

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,580
now have this designated mentoring area

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,250
where people can help and feel so

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:06,250
everybody started to come in ask

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,600
questions so by and large like what we

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,900
learned is like it's really worse

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,240
looking outside of your own you know

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,370
little bubble for inspiration if you

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,800
have facing challenges that you can't

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,070
solve so learning from other open

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,770
communities was so so helpful that it's

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,480
good to be bold to try new ideas even

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,280
though people might be skeptical because

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,380
of course it takes a lot of resources so

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,420
I had to have really tough conversations

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,400
mr. Wikimedia Foundation for Stark I'm

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,980
assigned to the mentoring program you

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,480
have to get volunteers to do it but if

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,220
you're convinced of it and you saw it

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,140
working somewhere else and you really

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,580
want to do it like people fight for try

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:48,460
to get it and it takes time commitment

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,780
and resources so onboarding newcomers is

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,130
nothing that you can't just do on the

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,050
fly I think we're all like if it's

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,030
important for us if it's a priority we

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,740
also need to treat it as a priority we

00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,860
need to put two resources them that are

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,790
needed to do it properly and cherish the

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,580
memories

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:07,450
like we we did everything to make

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,070
fermenters the rock stars of this of

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,780
this event like they got their old

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,360
t-shirts they got shoutouts they get

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,950
their own Klaus so I'll cherish the

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,230
newcomers but also cherish the people

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,210
who work with these newcomers who

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,860
dedicate their time and make it a

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,980
successful event for everybody so that

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,050
was really and one of the most important

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,930
that that's probably also one of the

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,670
biggest arguments for things like

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,950
mentoring programs is that productivity

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,930
and inclusiveness are not zero-sum games

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,850
we had both because everybody else they

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,380
could work on their projects they didn't

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,180
have to feel like everybody was not her

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,540
mentor and didn't want to be they could

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,460
work on their projects and didn't have

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,800
to be disturbed all the time whereas the

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,060
others could work together

00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,370
systematically and also producible so we

00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,930
had one of the longest showcases in the

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,970
history of the commedia hackathons

00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:58,570
because on both sides people did work

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,990
productively and it was just yeah it was

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,990
really nice

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,120
so but what apart from events because

00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,620
events are things that happen one two or

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,960
three times a year

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:15,039
that's okay that's a good start but it's

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,539
not enough so what we do ever since we

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,049
really try to pay attention to

00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:22,120
friendlies bases also outside of events

00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:24,760
you have to create like creative events

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,340
I spent this basis but online and

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,049
offline communication outside of the

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,440
major events should also be friendly

00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,500
spaces the way we communicate with each

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,360
other the way we treat each other so for

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,399
us at Wikimedia osteopath every event

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,669
now has a friendly space policy for

00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:44,799
example we also made sure to link our

00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:47,019
friendly space policy to our bylaws

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,429
to make sure that it's also an

00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:52,559
obligation of everybody who is a member

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:55,929
of our association to abide to that and

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,120
another important thing that goes with

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,090
friendly space and inclusiveness is

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,220
inclusive language so we just had our

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,039
bylaws and all of your documents of

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,630
inclusive language which is important

00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,760
and even more so in German and in

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,010
English so I I'm not sure what's your

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,210
native language some of you might know

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,220
what I'm talking about in English it's

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,409
not always as clear how important

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,960
gendered language can be to be inclusive

00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:22,139
but Germany's are heavily gendered

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,519
language so it really makes a difference

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,320
but it goes beyond gendered language

00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,179
inclusive language is also calling

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,100
Wikimedia projects not the German

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:32,150
Wikipedia or the English Wikipedia but

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,490
the english-language Wikipedia or the

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,040
language Wikipedia to acknowledge that

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,590
it has been you know created not only by

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,390
Germans or by people from England but

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,000
people from all over the world who speak

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,070
the language and particulates with

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,410
inclusive language also means not using

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,490
abbreviations without explaining them

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,590
when you aware that there are people

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,330
around who might not understand it to

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,460
make insider jokes but also give an

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,080
explanation for that there are so many

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,640
ways that our language can foster

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:05,690
inclusion and it's a process like and I

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,910
myself totally like also going the same

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,620
traps but being aware of it and try to

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,750
train yourself to be more inclusive in

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,140
the way you talk with each other it's

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:17,450
definitely rewarding and first and

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,980
foremost the thing that we took away

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,870
from that unless we still want to do

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,810
outside of a patterns and rebalance is

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,610
like really firing who are the rock

00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,230
stars

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,740
the rock stars in our movement so far

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:34,730
the people was the big edit accounts

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:36,020
thousands of edits or uploads or I don't

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,090
know like made this or that big

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,010
well-known project the inventor of the

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,480
Philips monuments I mean that's good

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,300
like these people should be rock stars

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,340
but mentors should also be rock stars

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,800
even if there is no easy tool that we

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,570
can program that counts how many people

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,640
are in this movement because of time

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,800
took out how many people stayed in the

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,540
movement because of their to count how

00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,550
many people to a better job in this

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,170
movement because of them yeah but I

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,330
always try to imagine if I know

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,920
something like some of the mentors and

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,690
what they're doing behind the scenes I

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,810
always try to imagine that army of

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,250
people could hide

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,020
they're walking around like just like an

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,090
augmented reality bubble very and all

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,160
these people that have something to say

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,780
thank you for this person and I think we

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,370
should celebrate that we should

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,960
celebrate that more we should give these

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,340
people more voice we should acknowledge

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,110
what they do and we should celebrate

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:27,450
them just as much as everybody was

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:29,850
thousands thousands of others so what

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:34,590
does that all mean for the cat caddy a

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:36,360
okee community I think you guys are far

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,690
ahead of us in many regards when it

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,490
comes to all these cultural all these

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,980
cultural requirements that make a

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,500
welcoming community as I said I talked

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,050
about to Lydia before and she told me

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,780
that a constructive work working

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,160
atmosphere has been there from day one

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,180
and it was always something that has

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,610
been cherished in this movement and it's

00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,920
still there like I mean you have this

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,380
strategic goals the sweet strategic

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,730
goals and I just stumbled over I already

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,740
knew it also for my conversation with

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,450
Lydia but I stumbled across that the

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,940
last couple of days when I prepared nice

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,470
life and Lydia was asking like what were

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,470
your highlights of the last year and

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,690
there's Nyoka toast I hope I pronounced

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,670
the name right and was saying like Oh as

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,800
a newcomer I submitted like one of these

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,830
three goals and I've been working on it

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,830
ever since and

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:30,830
this is amazing and I showed that to a

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,110
couple of people and from the wiki verse

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,299
and everybody said this would not be

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,330
possible in the beekeepers like having a

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:40,789
newcomer coming in and like defining and

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,740
being chosen was like mr. Pacheco and

00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:45,350
the strategical is also about onboarding

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,809
makes it even better but just that that

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,590
had such a strong signal that that's

00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:51,830
amazing

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:56,720
so we are far away from from being where

00:26:51,830 --> 00:27:11,389
you are also dislike embracing cuteness

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:13,850
so because we have cuteness too so I

00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:16,700
brought a representative here it's Percy

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,049
so cute animals are taking over the wiki

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,490
Burris has been for the last five years

00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:21,529
there so we can you give to this

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:27,830
association but we have far from you

00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:30,440
know embracing official cute animals as

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,029
as our representatives to the outside

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,789
world so I find that really really cool

00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,380
I wish we had something like that and

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:38,299
they're becoming more diverse too and

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:42,139
like every sub community or subtopic has

00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:47,360
their own little dragon that's amazing

00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:49,970
so you have it already and I think you

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,800
can make more out of it make it your USP

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,360
so USB slang

00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,640
it's exactly the kind of moment elusive

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,040
language that's why I explained it I'm a

00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,320
marketing person but it's a good term to

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,240
explain like what I mean it's like a

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,440
factor that differentiates you from

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,320
others so being a welcoming community

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,420
that's such a big asset and I think it

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,430
needs to be even more prominent than

00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,900
what you do because there are so many

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,580
communities out there they're looking

00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,140
for new people and want to convince

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,540
people that it's worth by working for

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,130
them and you already have such great

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,410
structures too I have these people

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,780
around so make even more of it make that

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,670
your USP that differentiates you from

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:34,960
other communities and make people want

00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:38,420
to work with you instead of others so

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,940
how could that work so I'm a newbie but

00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,860
in this community I feel comfortable

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,210
talking and making suggestions so in the

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,450
wiki verse I would probably miss left

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,370
but I make one or two suggestions and

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,010
what what could be done just from from

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,230
my very limited perspective but I heard

00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,760
you have a boards and every now and then

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,860
people get awarded for being great

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,810
mentors or for being great people who

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,300
are on board how about having our own

00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,450
category for that so just to make sure

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,280
that at least once a year somebody or

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,290
group of persons or people is

00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,340
appreciated for being great mentors for

00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:18,170
great on borders for great newbie

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:22,610
recruiters that that would be a start

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:25,640
and what's even more important give

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,110
these people a voice and a stage like

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,970
really find the rock stars are I think

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,590
you're already made closest of that that

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,600
people who on board you come

00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,279
are important to this community and

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,669
should be cherished and should be able

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,669
to to get a prominent status but also

00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:43,830
give them a voice and a stage that can

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,020
mean regular blog posts about these

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:49,980
things on your communication channels

00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,799
that means I don't know in programs like

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,960
in your conference programs make it our

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,390
own slot whatever you can do to make

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,789
these voices this story stirred and

00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,070
shared that will make it even more

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,289
obvious and even more a signal for

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:06,870
newcomers who look around for things

00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:08,370
that they can do to make it clear what

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,480
you already are a nice and welcoming

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:15,419
community so I think there's not much to

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,159
do but it could be a bit more systematic

00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,110
and even a stronger signal to the

00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,820
outside world to people who don't have

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,789
that background information or a nice

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:26,279
chat to media to make it really visible

00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:29,490
on first glance what's possible if you

00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,559
join if you try this coffee

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,720
here the resources I will share these

00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,250
service lights online like that that

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,630
would be a way to do that I'm happy to

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,950
do that so this is everything we

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,720
collected for hackathons so that's

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,150
probably another thing that you might

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,520
want to look into if you organize events

00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,559
there like a lot of big and small things

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,050
that could probably be adopted just like

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,690
we adopted them from others and I would

00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,370
be happy if you would yeah also make a

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,130
documentation of the things you are

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,530
going to learn in the context of your

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,630
strategic goal of onboarding new piece

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,490
because I'm eager to learn and I think

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,220
the beekeepers can learn a lot from you

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:09,870
so wherever you create resources let us

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:12,360
know and otherwise that's my my context

00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,890
I'm happy to answer questions now or at

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,119
any time in the future

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,119
[Music]

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,919
we need

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,630
[Applause]

00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,350
yes thank you I agree with some rock

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,610
stars and I was actually hesitating

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,550
whether I should and I was also thinking

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,320
very long about the pictures I use for

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,660
the slides when I presented it because I

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,170
agree that's probably not the best term

00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,720
but to get across that idea I decided to

00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,310
stick with it because just to make sure

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,080
like how important these people are I

00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,480
couldn't come up with a better term to

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,790
acknowledge the importance but within

00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,670
the community to come up with like good

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,050
terms on how we celebrate these people

00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,850
without our communities we can come up

00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,800
with alternative terms that everybody at

00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:18,200
least in the community understands but

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,850
to talk to an audience to explain what I

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,430
mean I decided to stick it but I

00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,410
completely agree that it's probably not

00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,490
the best term in the world thank you

00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,750
thank you for also for the

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,110
recommendation I will have a look at

00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,110
that book

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:11,170
I still don't think we live in a post

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,950
the lake-effect world possibilities like

00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,329
that like hopefully not but IIIi know

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,570
what you mean like that does it still

00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:20,920
work in like this in this time where

00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,900
this is very much challenged and

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,420
actually I don't know we all don't know

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,670
yet because what what we're seeing right

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,829
now is that people redirect their

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:32,079
problems to Wikipedia right like YouTube

00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:34,390
did for example say spooked us to a

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,829
certain extent Twitter like oh if you

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,450
want to validate whether something is

00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:40,150
right or not just go to Wikipedia so

00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:42,690
yeah nice thanks guys just send all the

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,619
trolls our way without everything

00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:49,150
without ever giving back to us yep so

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,760
yet have been a couple of interviews

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,740
also with Katherine Mayer director of

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,960
the commedia Foundation it's even more

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,760
in there because you have to look at it

00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,470
from a more global level but there's

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,119
this concern of the communities and

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:04,960
there's concern and their organizations

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,480
that the more Wikipedia is also put into

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,329
the limelight for those people the more

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,720
they will think about creative ways to

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:15,460
bypass our quality control systems that

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,079
we have and I think it also always

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,819
depends very much on the community and

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,640
approach if you're talking about the

00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:23,230
German language community is like a big

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,750
community with a lot of people with a

00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,550
lot of mechanisms to ensure quality

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,410
smaller languages with fewer editors

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,319
they probably already struggling with

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,300
that now so it really depends from

00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:35,770
project to project but we see we see

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,359
problems on the horizon that might

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,280
challenge the way we work so far the

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,170
more people actually think like oh

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,640
that's the last that's the last

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:49,480
how do you say that the last threshold

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:53,800
of source information let's let's work

00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,810
against that it is impossible and we

00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,490
have our concern so we will need to see

00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:01,420
what the future brings for us and how

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:04,840
our communities will deal with it but we

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:08,130
are aware but there's no definite answer

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,130
I can give to that right now

00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,900
I can leave you but I'm very close to

00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,240
so I'm actually German myself

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,920
and of course we ask ourselves that

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,540
question I think most Austin's would

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,670
immediately like governments are super

00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,320
important because you know like we've

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,630
already been entered that's true

00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,609
Austrian language and Austrian cultures

00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,460
marginalize the German language

00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:08,020
Wikipedia already and I'm not very

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,550
trustful that if you said lever fair

00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,040
let's not have to Commedia Ospital it

00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,930
will get any better if we don't have

00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,270
like a local organization that works

00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:19,330
with I don't know for example federal

00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,310
monuments office to help digitalize

00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,380
Austrian cultural heritage in a very

00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,050
systematic way I think we do all that

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,430
compare them

00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,530
and even in Germany you can see that

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,680
there is a trend for with

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:35,080
regionalization like all these media

00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,119
offices that pop up they're usually not

00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,580
stuck but at least they have like some

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,130
vertical space because even Germany

00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:46,180
things are a bit

00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,259
like one officer in our environment so

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,999
having a physical representation

00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,380
definitely helps whether it's called

00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:52,630
Wikimedia Australia Canada Germany

00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,470
that's of course available but I think

00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,119
I'm having a representation in physical

00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,519
space and also people who actually work

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:05,380
for exactly this part of the

00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:07,539
marginalized content is still important

00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,609
the question is like to what extent

00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:11,559
would be neat that and that's something

00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:13,599
we've seen at the moment we've be going

00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:15,910
through a huge movement widespread chief

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,619
Ellis's and presence like that are on

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,630
the table and how many organizations

00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:28,660
that we need to support one language of

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:32,500
the PDA but college

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:35,520
like one very important partner but it's

00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,520
a very good question thanks

00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,260
[Music]

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,040
the German language Wikipedia is a huge

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:38,980
huge challenge in that regard and if we

00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,330
try to find and recruit new cameras that

00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,859
is one of the biggest problem we can

00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:47,230
make it nice lttp event with editing and

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:48,940
then once they're on their own on the

00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:52,180
Wikipedia there's really little we can

00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:56,950
do to support them because the more we

00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:59,349
as staff members try to involve the

00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:02,830
harder it gets actually but their groups

00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:04,390
who work on projects like that often

00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,250
internationally I don't know how much

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,770
table in the German Wikipedia but I'm

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,290
happy to get you in touch with like and

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,840
actually it's um part party Austin

00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:16,330
project just last week there was ta

00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,010
Europe right in Stockholm and it's like

00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,050
since last year it's a tradition to have

00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:23,740
like if it came out of a project that we

00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:29,170
called Wikipedia cookies and lttp topics

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:31,030
were really tired of of Wikipedia for

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,680
peaceful for many reasons and there's a

00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,080
little international group that was like

00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,839
led from one Austrian who also many

00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,790
wikipedia for peace that Duty's Europe

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,530
right even with the tunnels for example

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:44,080
and he's also working in the German

00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:46,930
Wikipedia of course so I'm happy to get

00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,290
in touch with him and

00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:55,360
I think they do amazing work

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:57,430
internationally but also I know we will

00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,040
have an event like that here to probably

00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,530
even a bit bigger so and also be

00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:05,350
Commedia us there already I'm offered to

00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,060
to help organizing it and and hosting it

00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,040
so if you would be part of it that would

00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:12,390
be great so if we see each other next

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,390
year can hear me enough for that

00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,060
not really outside of events over like

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,560
flows event it's always easier to track

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,300
like autos was cement or this was a

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,580
scoop what did they do during the event

00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,140
what to say to after the event for the

00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,700
ongoing work during the year it's really

00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,619
hard and I think that's something that's

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,890
done that will be the next step for us

00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:10,950
to to come up with good ways to measure

00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:12,600
not unfortunately but we should stay you

00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,130
know especially in the tech space is

00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,810
even harder that one begin media

00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,570
projects it's easier to keep track of

00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,820
what people do on tech projects it's

00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,560
even you know for widespread can pick up

00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,600
or wiki data or replicating like where

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,670
do you start like and there's no good

00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,710
way so far that you can come up with but

00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,490
I'm happy to have that conversation in

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,490
future

00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,280
