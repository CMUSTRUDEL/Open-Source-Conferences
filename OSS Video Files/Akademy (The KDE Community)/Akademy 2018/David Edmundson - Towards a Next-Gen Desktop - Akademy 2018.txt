Title: David Edmundson - Towards a Next-Gen Desktop - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	The unique selling point of Plasma its ability for applications and 3rd parties to richly extend all core parts of the desktop environment. Components such as settings modules, kdeds and applets and runners all operate on a plugin oriented approach to load the various different system services into the specific view.

Whilst this works, it does not lead to a secure or robust solution nor does it work in a world moving towards containers and sandboxing.

In this presentation I shall outline the current recurring problems we have with Plasma's architecture and the plans to fix it.

I shall review status of the already merged work in krunner and the impact this had, along with presenting the upcoming work for running KCMS and plasmoids out of process through the use of wayland compositors which will help us build a more modern desktop environment.

[Music]

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,139
[Music]

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:21,350
so which

00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:56,890
so confused for different user service

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,899
and internet with its search providers

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:05,149
hey one on its own in just a text box

00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:08,149
and it doesn't have anything with first

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:13,390
Michelle on its own in just an empty

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,390
taskbar with nothing in it I drag around

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,120
system settings on its own it's an empty

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,820
window of a sci-fi identity until you

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,019
put other things in it

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:31,880
- what services that we have a water

00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:35,560
come from us so networking if you might

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,560
working Sergey

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,150
[Music]

00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:57,630
it's not unity services I've had a PCM

00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:00,970
for continuing up starts not very easy

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:05,560
but we have ability to allow anything

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,350
and that's very important so moving in

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,040
that what are some of your problems of

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,040
my face

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,610
[Applause]

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,750
[Music]

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:20,500
[Music]

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,500
so we

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:24,350
we have no ideal city given extra

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,700
dowon's now

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,700
so access the world

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,380
which is

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,410
[Music]

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,040
[Music]

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,819
[Applause]

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:55,050
so something's gonna break next I don't

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:55,050
know what secure

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,330
[Music]

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,330
[Applause]

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,229
[Music]

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,110
[Music]

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:27,569
[Music]

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:45,470
people could there's no way to even try

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:47,450
if you want and it's also it's in a way

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,570
situation across stuff on the Android

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:54,170
store more than enough for my monster

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:57,770
which is a sub security and a lot of you

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:02,960
probably can't a little picture of sorry

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:10,640
we're going to throw containers better

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:13,970
solution works but there are actually a

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,080
problem not solution because it's a

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,080
developer ships in

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,110
[Music]

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,260
so

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,630
and the way partner built environment we

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,480
have you different views and everything

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,270
in a puddle and my tech department

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:33,310
I'm counting to cure no files as a party

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:36,100
for so networking will have on and then

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:51,250
potentially own custom communication

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:56,980
protocol to talk between them so can we

00:11:51,250 --> 00:12:02,230
look at different ways so starting with

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,800
just a circle it's just made it seem

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:09,400
like it's not very thick but a simple

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:14,470
concept instead of a plugin we just talk

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:16,000
to another process buddy and hey man it

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,370
doesn't need to know about this is not

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,200
lonely miners and the poly put the

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:26,190
binaries are anything out there

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,190
ABI 20 so what plugins

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,770
so we're talking over debuff okay one it

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,980
doesn't even love it and this service

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:39,520
could be a standalone very small right

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:44,400
or it could be a second you have any way

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,400
so we could be talking to Katie

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,750
so

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,149
[Music]

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,370
[Music]

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,389
[Music]

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,929
[Music]

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,460
[Music]

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
so

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,810
which is

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:14,330
[Music]

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,809
[Music]

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,610
[Music]

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,320
[Music]

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,459
so

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,809
[Music]

00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:18,239
so

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,550
another window so actually with reduce

00:19:52,270 --> 00:20:00,920
emissions will not cover be possible

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:23,620
not very reasons we have the boss but

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:26,720
every but what's interesting in

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,720
[Music]

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,820
the window

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,359
[Music]

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,270
[Music]

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,650
[Music]

00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,270
[Applause]

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,440
[Music]

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,840
[Music]

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,640
[Music]

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,080
it didn't work

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:19,710
[Music]

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,819
[Music]

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:42,849
[Music]

00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:12,240
another don't we need to port ever like

00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:14,320
it was the sympathy or pity like which

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,690
comes later

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,090
fire away making stupid does not so it's

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,570
about adding Mexico with news and then

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,900
you - Michael - no not always a

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,900
wonderful

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,420
