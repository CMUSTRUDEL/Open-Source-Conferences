Title: David Edmundson - Towards a Next-Gen Desktop - Akademy 2018

Description: 
	The unique selling point of Plasma its ability for applications and 3rd parties to richly extend all core parts of the desktop environment. Components such as settings modules, kdeds and applets and runners all operate on a plugin oriented approach to load the various different system services into the specific view.

Whilst this works, it does not lead to a secure or robust solution nor does it work in a world moving towards containers and sandboxing.

In this presentation I shall outline the current recurring problems we have with Plasma's architecture and the plans to fix it.

I shall review status of the already merged work in krunner and the impact this had, along with presenting the upcoming work for running KCMS and plasmoids out of process through the use of wayland compositors which will help us build a more modern desktop environment.
