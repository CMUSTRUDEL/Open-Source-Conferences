Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	KDE produces Linux-based software that is the best-positioned to displace proprietary alternatives and become the default desktop shell used throughout the entire world. Come find out how we'll make it happen!

KDE's market share is less than 1%. This talk will discuss how you can help us raise that to 50% or higher over the next decade. We'll go over an actionable 7-step plan to make KDE's software so good and so well-distributed that nobody will be able to resist wanting to using it!
