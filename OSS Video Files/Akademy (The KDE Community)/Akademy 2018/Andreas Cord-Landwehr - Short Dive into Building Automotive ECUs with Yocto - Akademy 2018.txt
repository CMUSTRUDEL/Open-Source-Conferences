Title: Andreas Cord-Landwehr - Short Dive into Building Automotive ECUs with Yocto - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	Yocto is the most commonly used build and configuration management system for creating automotive-grade embedded systems that are based on Linux. When featuring a UI, these embedded control units often use Qt as their main development platform. But actually, automotive development is also a field where we want to see the use of key assets of our KDE community like the KDE Frameworks 5 libraries, too.
In this talk, I will introduce the basic principles and concepts of Yocto. My focus lies on the integration of libraries and applications into a Yocto based board image and how to generate and to use a cross-building SDK. Moreover, I will discuss the recent steps taken to make Qt and KDE Frameworks 5 available in the Yocto world.
