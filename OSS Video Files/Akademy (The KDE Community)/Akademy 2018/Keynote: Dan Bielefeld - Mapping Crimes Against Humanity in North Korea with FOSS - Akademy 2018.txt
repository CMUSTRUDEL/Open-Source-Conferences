Title: Keynote: Dan Bielefeld - Mapping Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea with FOSS - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	The technical director of a start-up NGO with a tiny IT budget turns to FOSS, but finds more than just software that is free (as in beer).

Starting with a brief overview of the nature of the state of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and its human rights situation, this talk will then introduce the concept of transitional justice, which works together with, but also goes beyond, the traditional human rights approach.

The heart of the talk will describe our project, “Mapping Crimes Against Humanity in North Korea,” and how many of the challenges we face have been partially or fully addressed using free and open source software and data (FOSSD).

Challenges unique to implementing FOSS solutions in South Korea will also be covered.
