	00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:24,279
thank you so first let me introduce

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,980
myself for those who you don't know me

00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,330
my name my name is not very useful so

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:34,980
that's my email you want to tell me

00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,980
something just send me an email back to

00:00:37,199 --> 00:01:02,710
my general stopping PD for over ten

00:00:48,309 --> 00:01:04,750
years one thing that I think it's

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,430
especially important to remember is that

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,350
nothing that I'm going to talk about

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,560
this talk is because I am part of the

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,560
poor

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:29,060
but it means back well let's start from

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:59,509
the beginning so if you're into well

00:01:29,060 --> 00:02:07,630
this wiki page here but all the ways of

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:10,550
becoming PD project and concept of you

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:18,200
and then there's different places where

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:22,070
your project then into India because

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:26,329
you're it's not part of our expectations

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:29,890
anyways so we're going to talk about the

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:33,170
kiddy incubator which is something that

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:40,070
it's fairly winkeny when I started

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:42,830
thinking it's something that here it was

00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:47,840
a particle of the creation of the

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:51,350
so crazy explain us how I held it how I

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,870
saw it but it mostly but at some point

00:02:51,350 --> 00:03:09,740
there was these my pistol discussion

00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:11,960
actually both if you've been around but

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,280
in general if you became a manifesto

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,280
what we're talking about these

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:30,200
governance they need to be free so to be

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:34,630
inclusive everyone to be think it's

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,630
important that the projects are shared

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,740
we have an inducer photo so I think we

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:52,990
create it for a person somewhere which

00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:52,990
TV digital something our panels

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:06,100
maybe it's too abstract but in general

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,100
what the kidding cubetto is about is

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:16,640
being able to find a project that is

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:20,330
existing this project join PD and be

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:26,510
able to enjoy all of these concepts that

00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:34,490
we included the manifesto so in this

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:38,980
room who has an all right then all of

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,980
you very much unless

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,800
that's what I said all right all right

00:04:42,680 --> 00:05:00,550
that's that's right who has not read the

00:04:45,800 --> 00:05:00,550
manifesto I'm not angry and the lion is

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,120
the real reason why I wanted to do this

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,840
presentation isn't it self that I think

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,660
that the incubation process is amazing

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,330
it's because it kind of feels like it's

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,010
something that is there he was kind of

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:24,670
bureaucratic and we don't really know

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:27,860
who is actually it's something that

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,810
happened to me like I knew we had the

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,810
manifesto and you had this process

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,760
it's psychotic University was already

00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:08,310
beginning and they were interested the

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:17,940
KT community and the things we do but

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:24,240
then so after talking to a couple of

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:28,140
people the right solution they may want

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,870
these people to be able to gently ended

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:35,910
their project was like looking for

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,170
incubation or something of the lights

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,920
which is something that happens a lot

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,080
right start working on something we get

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:48,540
on board at ourselves and then expect

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,810
that the rest piece everything makes

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,810
sense

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,610
when you're working on free software you

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,020
see that the big advantage is that

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:08,310
everything is in the open so you can do

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:20,870
it yourself but then what do you have to

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:20,870
do I have to learn there's nothing like

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:33,320
this wiki we can we can take a look at

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:36,210
it so that at least you've seen it

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:42,770
explaining the full process in a lot of

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:45,150
detail it's actually really fun the

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:49,550
interesting page when you start doing

00:07:45,150 --> 00:08:08,540
stuff is this one incubated projects so

00:07:49,550 --> 00:08:08,540
there's basically somebody from

00:08:16,630 --> 00:09:22,300
so that's easy start

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:26,620
so what we do is we copy this page into

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,750
anyone these words till the blank kind

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:35,830
of thing because it's for a project

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:39,630
hasn't started we put it in into one of

00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,630
the pages like the rest

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:54,639
like we have for example at present a

00:09:52,579 --> 00:10:00,889
civilian life so if we're intubating

00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:02,870
office in office you would do two small

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:08,240
pitch in it and then you will start

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:10,220
pinning stuff and we expect it to be

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,050
Greek because kicking is already a kitty

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:19,879
project it's not we can bite but he did

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:25,459
a very thorough job reconfigure the idea

00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:27,470
is that you will the sponsor is the

00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:33,980
thing that we use into the competition

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:44,839
so as a sponsor you will start start

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:50,029
talking to the project covers like I

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:54,939
said it's about maybe as well so the

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:59,769
pretty meeting they will have to learn

00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:59,769
the manifestation be continued project

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:07,750
they should know somebody going through

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,750
the internet can find

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,950
I'm gonna move this project to Kady

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:16,260
because we want to actually like have a

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,580
healthy place I'm taking pity so they

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,140
need to another project they need to

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,390
know what's the license on their project

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,470
they give to know it works and if you

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:27,780
know where people are talking like

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,740
meaningless IRC channels many ways for

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,740
example something that you would

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:51,000
infrastructure so the website is also

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,750
something I found that it's best nothing

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,700
to be in a hurry

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,810
thank you the sponsorship you are a

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,230
direction india.arie

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:01,830
it's it's a process that doesn't need to

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,600
be happening one day it finally happens

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,500
in a month in the end leave something

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:12,060
it's a relationship that should stay

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,900
says for the next few years if they want

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,900
to continue working on the project

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,510
not a matter of doing everything today

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,980
it's a matter of talking things through

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:28,750
letting everyone to they're the wrong

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:39,310
thing at the sponsor something that I

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:44,880
found very school education is project

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:51,160
maintainers it's what what ensures that

00:12:44,880 --> 00:13:01,180
the conversation is people from the

00:12:51,160 --> 00:13:03,870
project not used to talking something so

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,570
it's fine like to have a more familiar

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:10,390
media of course you're free to decide

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,510
what to do if you don't like showing

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:19,090
your face or showing your voice you can

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:21,430
do I think that having regular calls

00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:26,170
though works pretty well one of the

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:37,860
things that happens really commonly in

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:40,210
the whole process is the actual people

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:45,720
they create amenities they create

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,720
ripples like they accept the user

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:55,540
privileges they actually mostly what it

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,670
means that you do between the different

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,910
meetings is just telling him on how you

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,960
create an endless over the ticket at me

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:06,880
as a subscriber so that I see it when we

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,180
meet next time next week next month or

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,180
forever

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,880
what's that do things in parallel right

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,480
but if you're waiting on the many ways

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:29,220
we created that maybe there's not it's

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:31,350
happening I think about the rotation I

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,820
thought that probably three or five

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,100
poles is what ends up being what we

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,460
needed

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:49,610
is there anyone here they're all

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:49,610
illusions thought you can talk to Aditya

00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:00,750
Camillo committed or any other of the

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,710
project that's happening committed by

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:10,790
other people who are otherwise nice ask

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,780
them about the experience I'm sure they

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,640
especially if you're interested in

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,530
everyone keep it in something which you

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:22,740
are because it wouldn't be interested

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:27,210
having more free software control but

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:30,890
yeah overall what what we've been

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,890
talking is mostly not about places

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:43,980
you have to see that it it's not about

00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:46,290
these all processes that we do to have

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,360
projects actually and not becoming any

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,100
project that's super boring and I agree

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,020
but it's also a process that we need

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,400
right and it's not that we need it

00:15:52,020 --> 00:16:03,350
because they're impotency or they're

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:07,250
cool to be on it's hard just be quick

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,960
it's about having these people know that

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,180
what K is about actually making sure

00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:17,210
that their Academy which is something

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,210
actually really successful at doing

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:35,400
so if you're still feeling insecure the

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,690
kind of things that you would want to

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:45,040
see how it works and maybe try to make

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:47,680
sure understand identity account get

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,140
permissions for flora if there's a super

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,120
good wiki we have in community okay this

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:58,960
org if you search for feeds something

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:03,730
you will find it easily it's something

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:07,330
that it's very healthy I think to to

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:24,070
tell the incubated project to look into

00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:26,589
because a fabricator it's something that

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:39,580
you can put some kind of disease but

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:42,130
actually really this website and if

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,470
there's problems or some insights make

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,960
sure that you are there to explain but

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,960
it's happening if they see someone

00:17:51,170 --> 00:18:01,520
we feel that it's weird but if your

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:04,130
instead I don't think I'm forgetting

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,250
something but the general idea is that

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:12,080
they should be just JKD to be part of

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,120
services that that we provide to the

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,530
bill to our community

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,690
see I structure meaningless website

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,150
promo as well actually promote is

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,690
probably the last of the incubation

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,910
process

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:30,350
I'd like maybe project now you need to

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:37,670
make sure that the world knows it's a

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:40,910
kiddie project now well we need to learn

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:51,740
how to tie sexy what was this project

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:56,480
putting on the table and making sure say

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,390
big big part our promo yeah

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,150
minor is like one of the big programs

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,370
are going to see when this is finally in

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,040
KD which is which takes us back to the

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,680
first part of the slide is that the

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,890
project ends up in this review process

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,600
the ring should be fine because well in

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,600
general if the

00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:49,120
which from time to time

00:19:50,029 --> 00:20:00,289
but in general I think that everyone

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,239
I remember that has been incubated have

00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:13,009
been just self-releasing maybe

00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:15,739
eventually but the important part of

00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:17,299
that is that they will want to get

00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:21,559
pancreas right they will eventually want

00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:25,960
to be on every distro it's something

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:29,919
that can use some study you can remember

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:33,019
your pinky bees is that even though

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,269
you've moved them down into the active

00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,809
projects in the incubation wiki that

00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,809
doesn't mean that

00:20:49,950 --> 00:21:00,230
it's a friendly face it's always alright

00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,230
so if there's any questions

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,870
well that's that's a good question is

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:56,550
well creating these trust relationship

00:21:53,810 --> 00:22:08,910
an important part about being a project

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:12,420
is what figure together eventually I

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:14,970
think that this is but the general it's

00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:24,570
a matter of seeing what the problems are

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:28,920
if we can another interesting thing is

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:31,200
as I always say the binaries bar also

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,560
translations right like when I started

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,850
in PDA bra

00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:40,000
it used to be a note in the

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:43,299
I was releasing Turtles ever done that

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,450
and amazingly people found it like there

00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:49,809
was the first district haunted actually

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:54,179
I never understood why or how did that

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:54,179
happen but then as soon as my project

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:04,750
and virtually on every but what a lot of

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,419
languages this is something they're

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,460
sending me lots of very if this project

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:14,070
for example it's speaking of nothing

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,070
half more for as many languages we have

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,690
but being able to create this kind of

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,320
synergy just by being inside of PD I

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,740
think that it's super powerful certainly

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,740
one of our

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:28,129
incubate the doping but another point

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:34,279
Kitty projects get to talk sprints also

00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:35,989
be part of our house I mean they can

00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:37,909
they get to come to ketamine and talk

00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:41,169
about our project and learn from other

00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,169
people who are interested

00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:11,140
I don't know I haven't seen the limit

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,610
and I have never seen a limit where

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,220
we've had too many of them on the other

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,310
hand we do have the manifesto like the

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:23,900
line is definitely do these projects

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:26,210
follow the manifesto I think that this

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,520
could be I mean even there are so many

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,860
projects that that are aligned with 3d

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,190
vision that's great it's not something

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,190
we should be

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:56,860
but you're not done again does any part

00:26:53,560 --> 00:27:00,820
of it I think it doesn't understand but

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:02,110
I owe it and also translations you can

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,880
say it gives you translation

00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,410
infrastructure of the actually important

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,150
part of interpretation is not having

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,150
tradition so far as having translator

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,790
which is still the same thing right when

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,260
we were talking about how KD can do

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,030
better see either his father's not

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,950
because we're better than it it's

00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,460
because we know what our problems are

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,460
and

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:15,790
I don't think if you look at the list of

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,790
projects

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:25,660
like you may be weak but the rest there

00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:34,390
are project that are very similar to any

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:37,680
project there you see for NASA safe

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:41,710
therapy is it's not really about about

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,960
bringing we are well then we know

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,540
there's people who could be working with

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,900
us like today make sure that these

00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,900
people

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,060
but for keyd that

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,370
in general I think it's more people

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:36,820
losing interesting projects more than

00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:39,220
them becoming people because alright

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,580
then thank you for coming and throw the

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,580
questions

00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,290
