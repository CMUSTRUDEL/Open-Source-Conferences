have PIM people here

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,060
it's the Boff wrap-up session and today

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,460
we've got slightly smaller crowd than

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,769
yesterday but we still had a ton of

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,689
buffs to happen so I'd like to call each

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,539
and every one of them for today's ball

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:37,050
wrap up starting with Katy India Divya

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:40,620
would you tell us yes today in the above

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,500
we had about 13 people from India our

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,690
Academy and we had you today as well he

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,870
wanted to share with us his experiences

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,059
doing events in Sylvania so we did a

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,530
quick round of introductions we heard

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,660
from everyone about how they got started

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,500
with carry their journey what brought

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,570
them here and we decided on a plan a

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,290
framework for concert carry a tour in

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,299
2019 and we also decided that we'd like

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,580
to have more if decentralized events

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,110
each one of these people going back to

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,990
their universities in their cities

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,390
around 12 cities in India and you know

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,479
talking about kiri getting people

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,820
started and then have that lead up to

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,500
Conrad career RN so yeah a lot of

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,500
exciting stuff in the plan

00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:32,160
[Applause]

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,400
continuing with the geographical theme

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:40,200
we also had a KDE in the Americas both

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,810
and so I'd like to call on Sandro yes we

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,140
had a kitty in America both with roughly

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,110
10 people over there it was a place

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,560
where we share Sherrod of our

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,350
experiences in organizing get KD

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,310
conferences in the United States and

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,130
also in in South in South America we try

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,910
to choose identify some issues that have

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,840
been preventing us for having a big

00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,880
bigger KD process there and we also

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,690
considering a we are considered a

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,910
considering having KDP people in some

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,110
conferences that have a very very big

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,750
audience for for free software in

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,180
countries like Colombia and Cuba we are

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,690
also considering having a first edition

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,090
of the latin-american Cadiz summit in

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,320
countries other than Brazil trying to

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,500
cede the KD Commission over there that's

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,500
it

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,250
[Applause]

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,890
thanks Andrew bringing kte to new places

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,590
is an important issue and that brings us

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,870
right to the onboarding boss which was

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,970
run by me Oh fetus came prepared today

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,890
so we discuss a bit about the

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,930
developments during Academy it was great

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,000
having so many newcomers and new

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,460
contributors here for the first time at

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,070
least from what I understand and it was

00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,410
great that these new people felt felt

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,630
free to come out and reach out to us and

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,160
discuss about ways to get involved we

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,540
also had a chance to discuss with other

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,060
projects and what they are doing in

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,550
terms of onboarding new people into

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,630
their communities so we got some ideas

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,670
and feedback there in connections in the

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,430
both we were identified two paths of

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,440
getting involved so one is about the

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,970
path through applications and people

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,010
coming in because they are users of

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,470
applications and then the other path of

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,240
trying to join KT directly as an

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,700
organization and see how people can help

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,550
and we discussed ways that we can help

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,980
people onboarding from both paths we

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,440
discuss a bit about Junior jobs on

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,540
fabricator and how we could like try to

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,209
group them together and perhaps have the

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,370
possibility of filtering them and

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,880
depending on the skills involved and all

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,100
that we also discussed about what we can

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,200
do for non coders since most of this

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,530
discussion seems to be mostly focused on

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,239
coders so we want to have to engage

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,850
other people as well but have other

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,060
skills and other interests and there are

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,470
ways to do that we also discussed about

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,330
setting up a development environment

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,490
which seems to be an urgent issue in

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,169
terms of getting people like starting to

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,570
work on the code and getting the code

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:31,130
done and we consider various solutions

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,080
mostly like around evolving around

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,730
containers maybe VMs docker and all that

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,030
so we need to come up with a solution

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,690
that fits our needs and yeah more or

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,690
less that's it

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,210
[Applause]

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,330
thanks neo photos the visual design

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,250
group had a sit-down to figure out where

00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:01,810
they were where they are

00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:12,220
I guess Andy is nowhere right now so

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:13,960
we'll skip the vdg all right we've we're

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,690
we're great at improvising so here's

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:25,740
Marco to talk about what the vdg off was

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:34,420
about so the the discussion as far I

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:37,200
remember was in part about about small

00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:42,990
small things in the design currently and

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:50,940
another part on more overarching goals

00:05:42,990 --> 00:06:00,910
so we identified several several things

00:05:50,940 --> 00:06:03,910
that were then then divided by very

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,840
small and immediate paper cuts that have

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:15,630
to face fix it as soon as possible and

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:19,060
then set of medium-term goals of of

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:22,180
design things that will be very

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,090
important but are slightly more

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:29,560
complicated will take a while and a list

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:34,060
of long-term goals of overarching goals

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:42,640
for the for the next year I guess at

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:47,560
least and we also talked a bit about how

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:52,130
to get more people involved in the vdg

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:58,520
also developers how to

00:06:52,130 --> 00:07:03,140
better communications communication

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:07,300
channels to have the developer talk

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:14,210
directly with vdg people without being

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:17,300
intimate intimidated for them to to tell

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:20,420
you know what you watch what you did is

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,850
horrible that you throw it away to be

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,840
assured that this will not happen and

00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:32,420
also on the other other way of vdg

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:35,660
people to to also not fear developers

00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:38,080
because because there is this bit of

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:44,060
fears on the on the two sides so the the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:48,050
vdj person also may have some some fear

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,210
or being told that yeah your mock-ups

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,790
aids is impossible and i don't i don't

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,310
like it i don't want to do it so how to

00:07:52,790 --> 00:08:00,790
make this this dialogue a bit more

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,790
organic and you could say more but

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:09,139
[Applause]

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:13,469
thanks Marco for that detailed and

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:16,139
impromptu summary of the vdg bluff there

00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:21,689
was a bunch of slots of today for neon

00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:24,080
so I'd like to call a neon you're a

00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:30,949
shining example

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:34,110
so neon ball we had three slots and a

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:37,680
three in these three slot we discussed

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:44,219
like various topics including some of

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:47,250
the pressing through items saw however I

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,610
liked what we learned up of what we

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:55,310
learned about doing distribution using

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:59,279
Ubuntu 1604 with then last two years and

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,410
what we what we learned about the Bionic

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,810
upgrade I mean like we are working on

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,540
the window Bionic upgrade from like

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,790
quite a while and what lessons we

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,189
learned and like and there were also

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:15,209
like some topics discussed about the

00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:18,779
infrastructure overall it was a create

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:24,380
today pause and he out quite some

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,380
to-do items for the upcoming days

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:37,120
thanks Bhushan it's important to mention

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,220
infrastructure because in terms of

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,960
security it's important to know that

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,690
what you get is what we actually

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,750
distribute so there was a GPG key

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,630
signing both as well over 30 KDE

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,440
developers sat down in a room to do the

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,770
GPG key signing dance making sure that

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,180
yes everyone is who they say they are

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,510
this is important because we use those

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,960
GPG keys to sign our releases sign the

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:07,150
tar balls that turn into KDE so it's

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,300
important for us to have a web of trust

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,820
among all the developers that's a yearly

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,060
ritual and I'm glad we held it again

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,060
this year

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:22,860
Thank You Harold for organizing it

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,480
[Applause]

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,050
moving on into a different room and back

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,600
in the morning

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:32,550
there was the KDE and free cute

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:39,910
foundation both was there anyone there

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:44,140
anyone left from that baath so at the

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,180
Katy free cute Foundation buff it was

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,550
first a bit of history and what is the

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,370
Katy free cured foundation buff and then

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,010
there was a bit of a topic about

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,140
apparently last night all of the top top

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,450
management of acute company that nobody

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,550
had ever seen together flew in to drink

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,910
beer with the Katy freaky foundation

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:08,350
members and that was apparently all that

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:14,380
there was to that then there was a bit

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:17,650
of discussions about retiring parts of

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:22,270
cute and I think what the plan for those

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,370
parts might be the cute company thumbs

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,730
it into the world on the bsd license

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,390
because then the customers can keep

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,480
using it

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,060
without problems and if anybody wants to

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,950
give it love for the future they can do

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,010
that as well

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:42,190
and then there was a couple of walk war

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,940
stories and a bit of more history and

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,940
that was about that

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,150
[Applause]

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,090
thanks suna for that concise summary

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,340
there was a configuration ball that

00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,850
filled up a couple of slots as well have

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:08,980
we got any configuration people they've

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:11,530
been misconfigured I guess so we'll skip

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,900
that one and move on to plasma mobile

00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,090
there was an impromptu plasma mobile

00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,940
Boff so I'd like to call on Bouchon to

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:23,050
tell us something about that so it was

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,910
totally on schedule pause we decided at

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,420
like 30 last minute to have at this

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,670
Wharf and I mean like in terms of

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,440
attendees there were only like four to

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:38,440
five people so we went through some of

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,410
the tasks which we had in the backlog

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,510
about how onboarding our new

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,640
contributors what are the main pain

00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,520
points and like how do we want to

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,270
approach those problems we've and

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,140
foolish we created some more new items

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:59,600
some more smaller size to-do items and

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,800
yeah overall it was a productive off

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,620
[Music]

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,620
[Applause]

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:11,769
okay we'll get a summary of the

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,740
configuration buff from Kevin Koffler so

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:19,360
at the configuration buff there was a

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:22,410
pretty long discussion and there were

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,139
separate topics that were engaged and

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:29,620
almost the issue first of all issues and

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:36,959
nice things about the current K config

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:40,660
and K config xt implementations and also

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:46,410
the topic that came up is K conf update

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:51,459
which has several practical issues and

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:54,910
then the author of Elektra presented his

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:58,990
framework and there is interesting in

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:02,319
getting K config to use Elektra the idea

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:05,259
would be that that that K config would

00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:09,610
use Elektra as an intermediate layer and

00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:12,610
standard current K config implementation

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,620
would become an Electra back-end so in

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,540
some way this would reintroduce the back

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,350
end system into K conflict but it would

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,120
no longer be k ds problem the k conflict

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,339
will be pretty good only after maintain

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,800
the front end and the back end and the

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:31,720
whole back end management is then

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,860
Electress problem and seal it would and

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,519
they did the flexibility of using other

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,050
backends like a tap and so we're not

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,069
losing anything from the current

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:47,920
implementation and this Electra has some

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:51,490
nice features so it sounds interesting

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,429
we see what's going to happen there yeah

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,410
and one highlight of the of the puffs

00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:59,319
was the pizza that he offered to

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,730
everyone the Electra or Thor so if you

00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,730
weren't there you miss something

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:11,670
[Applause]

00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:14,880
good technology is always accompanied by

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,470
good food or something else good

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,050
technology can also be accompanied by

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,730
paper folding I believe that's a

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:32,720
tradition so I'd like to call on the

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:39,180
kirigami so on the kirigami both we

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:45,029
parted I started to do a little synopsis

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:47,160
of what were the what was the

00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:54,139
communication at the beginning to come

00:15:47,160 --> 00:16:00,300
up with the UI paradigms that are more

00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:05,250
central to kirigami that are that are

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,540
quite related on navigation and where

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:13,290
the controls are

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:20,310
and who gets also peep also other newer

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:27,029
designers to to to know that so that

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:31,290
that we can now discuss more in detail

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:35,730
what actually kirigami is in the sense

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:37,980
of how we present presented to the to

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:43,459
the public how we present to people that

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:51,540
want to develop convergent application

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:55,500
that also came with pretty pretty heavy

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:59,959
consequence which is the realization

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:04,760
that we need we need much more

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:09,049
documentation and we also need as

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:13,220
beautiful as possible website as a

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:17,279
landing page which

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:26,639
explains in a very visual way what are

00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:30,450
the the principal design paradigms that

00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:32,850
are at the base of kirigami and then

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:37,460
after that we started to discuss more

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:43,529
more details especially on a series of

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:46,529
controls that several people developing

00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:51,360
applications wanted but are still not

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:56,340
during kirigami so so that will need to

00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:00,539
be implemented soon but this is more on

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:05,190
an implementation detail so the biggest

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:08,340
takeaway was was we need to get together

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:13,519
and build a beautiful website for it

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,519
which will be a ton of work exciting

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,390
[Applause]

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,000
thanks Marco KDE is also all about

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:27,090
choice and trying out new things and

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,940
building more software more interesting

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,460
technology on the efforts of others and

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,970
one of those efforts is the maui project

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,700
which ties into applications on mobile

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:45,990
devices it ties into key tegami to

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:49,730
someone from maui here camilo alright so

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,730
we standing on the shoulders of giants

00:18:51,110 --> 00:19:02,130
so camilla presented the three

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:10,320
applications that he's developing right

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:14,900
now the music play player wave the index

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:20,360
I think file manager and the and the

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:24,900
image a viewer that it he has he had a

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:29,250
laptop phone running Android and a phone

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:32,250
running plasma mobile so everybody in

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:37,440
the room could try the same applications

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:41,070
on the on the three devices and it

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,990
talked a bit on some some extra

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:50,670
components that they built on built on

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:56,970
top of of kirigami and on on my side we

00:19:50,670 --> 00:20:00,180
were we were discussing also how how to

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:05,210
do the relationship wood between the two

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:09,720
projects so that Maui becomes eventually

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:15,570
a testing ground for for new UI

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:19,500
paradigms and those that gets then

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:23,400
proved can also be up streamed so so

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,299
then that both projects can gain from

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:30,830
each other

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:33,140
and we will have both on the Maori side

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,179
and the kirigami side and Plasma mobile

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:43,929
side beautiful mobile you guys in the

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:47,390
future alright I'm a big fan of

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:50,179
beautiful you eyes on mobile devices and

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,360
of course there's more mobile devices

00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:55,700
than just plasma mobile you're the

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,340
important guys but Katy applications on

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:04,000
Android is also a thing and there was a

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:09,500
buff on KDE applications on Android -

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,390
yes so we talked about what we have

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,370
today the like it wasn't a lot about

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,340
planning but mostly making sure

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,380
everybody knows what's what's available

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,149
we have applications that are specific

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,070
for mobile since the beginning like

00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,899
inari which is pretty new and if you

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,480
haven't looked at it you should but then

00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:28,159
we have lots of applications that we

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,950
never considered putting on Android but

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,929
now they are like ocula or or

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,230
conversation so there's that we also

00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:38,750
have some servers building these

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,789
applications for us so we can test like

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,370
we can develop them locally and just

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:45,350
download the apk file and try it on on

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,630
our phone I think it's really cool so I

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,570
was showing how how people can can use

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,210
that how they can build these apks as

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:57,039
well on their computer and that's what

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,039
we talked about mostly yeah thanks

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:12,550
don't don't go far LH because there was

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:17,590
also a flat-pack and snaps yeah nobody

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:20,560
got hurt nobody got even punched now it

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,740
was an interesting conversation I think

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,160
about these these formats how can we let

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,510
our developers think about how their

00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,000
applications are going to be reaching

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,130
the users which is probably one of the

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,560
interesting points the conversation well

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,790
started on a higher level seeing which

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,430
applications and web applications can

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,590
can n are being packets for for these

00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:44,770
systems and it went all the way down to

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,020
discussing how portals work and what can

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,820
we do to make sure it works for those

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,310
who don't know what portals are is the

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,690
mechanism we have nowadays or one of the

00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,130
mechanism we have nowadays for these

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,480
applications to talk to the host

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,370
operating system because what we're

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,260
trying to do is to make sure that these

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,660
applications are secure so they're not

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,240
stalling your data while while they're

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,070
letting you play a game so portals are a

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,170
way to make sure that this works well

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,770
and both all systems supported so that's

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,770
written for

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,599
[Applause]

00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,539
thanks al ace you you can tell we can

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:24,799
deploy in LA just by copying him onto

00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:27,679
the floor and it just works we're gonna

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:33,070
wrap up the wrap-up session with que te

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,070
PIM is Dan around or a PIM stir

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:45,140
all right Volker welcome so we vud the

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,940
larger tasks and topics from the pimp

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,850
sprint and looked at how we were

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:54,470
progressing is this one of those items

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:56,360
is the new product like website then has

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,700
a prototype of that which by now even

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,720
has new content where we could use some

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,700
some help and review

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,280
contact on Windows Hana is making great

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,200
progress with the platform underneath it

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,410
but the application itself isn't there

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,930
yet Peyman valent that is almost working

00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:21,620
there is one problem with the out of

00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,960
process 18 config dialogues but Dan is

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,790
working on that

00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,470
regarding the developer story we now

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,720
have a docker image Wesley the full

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,890
setup that at least 10 and Sandra are

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,990
using in production

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,820
there's some k develop integration thing

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,820
that they've all sold out is a leash

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,680
then we looked at the results of they

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,310
came a user survey we did since since

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:49,910
last year that had more than 3,000

00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:52,490
responses the most with requested

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:56,750
features is unified in boxes which then

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:59,510
has implemented by now one of the most

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,430
common complaints is search or related

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:05,930
to search which then has rewritten by

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:09,500
now and another common complaint is the

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:17,060
whole account setup workflow which Dan

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:19,040
is looking into now and we looked at the

00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,250
up streaming of them stuff into

00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,740
frameworks that will be what will

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,370
upstream the syndication framework next

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:30,230
that's the US as an RDF parser which I

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:35,630
think was also used in plasma at some

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:37,160
point and to be looked at the currently

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:42,310
biggest technical debt which is the

00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,310
whole repository on what you'll set up

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:49,580
see how we improve the dependencies and

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,060
we'd use the number of modules

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,110
we looked at potential telemetry usage

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,920
there's two questions we would like to

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:59,840
look at which is the best default

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,280
setting for the main layout and which of

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,450
the thousands of grouping and sorting

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:10,070
settings we could potentially get rid of

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,530
yeah that's at least a part I attended I

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:16,970
think it was another hour of fix my

00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:18,200
favorite part afterwards but I'm not

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:27,770
sure if anyone is here who actually

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:29,570
attended that part so that's it thanks

00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,580
folker in the meantime everyone is being

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,620
silly with the hats which is of course

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:41,660
the hats of authority it belongs to the

00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:44,330
president of KETV it temporarily duty to

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,050
have a safe and fun evening and with

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:51,640
smart for another day of buffs and

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:51,640
