this is going to be very short thing

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,990
because I'd like to get the conference

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,289
as a whole back on schedule

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,880
[Music]

00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:21,539
welcome to the KT community goals talk

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,640
both privacy and security by default the

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,820
Sebastian was originally going to give

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,330
this talk could not attend Academy for

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,180
personal reasons and so lightning talks

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,640
squashed together hey here's a bunch of

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,030
things that Katie the Katie community is

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,670
working on in terms of privacy so the

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,880
background to this this community goal

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,850
is that in 2017 we had the long

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,970
drawn-out KT community goals process

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,280
which resulted at the end of 2017 in one

00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:58,590
particular fabricator task it will tell

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,170
you what was decided and what kind of

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,170
what was decided to work on for the next

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,659
three to five years we have a long term

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,130
goal and long term commitment to

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,040
protecting privacy and maintaining user

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,170
security we can boil it down to one

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,240
sentence TV software names and promotes

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:25,530
privacy but there's also much longer

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:28,770
description things that came out of the

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,840
whole privacy discussion is that free

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,470
software can offer its users a fifth

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,350
freedom the fifth freedom which is the

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,250
freedom to decide where your data goes

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,460
and to keep your data your own you so

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,400
choose because a lot of proprietary

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,220
software nowadays you pay for it because

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,170
it's freezing beer you pay for it with

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,540
your privacy with your data by giving up

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,540
something other people

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,110
which has been so kte software the stuff

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,130
we as a community produced can be better

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,860
to me unique by promoting a better

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,440
experience one that better in the sense

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,769
of by promoting an experience that

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,530
preserves privacy and respects your

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:22,340
privacy by default see we we as a

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,980
community we don't need to be paid by

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,819
giving it by you or by our users giving

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,130
up their privacy

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:35,010
so by default we don't leave plasma

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:38,250
doesn't information applications don't

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,860
leave information either now to do this

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,080
is made the KDE software support this we

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,030
have a lot of work that's due because

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,769
we've got to make sure that all of our

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,920
applications actually live up to this

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:55,380
promise and so we've 4k TV developers

00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:01,410
from all across the staff from the low

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:05,940
down encryption stop up to hey let's

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,810
make an entire phone operating system so

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,769
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,459
have a quick for presentations in a row

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:17,660
where these final developers to tells

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,660
you what they've been working

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,930
besides our applications not leaking

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,470
right there's a related problem for some

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:52,689
application there is simply no privacy

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:56,609
of their digital assistants is one of

00:03:52,689 --> 00:04:00,390
those subjects the part I looked at is

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:04,510
specifically the travel related features

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:07,480
you might know the stuff like territory

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:13,180
features in Gmail that automatically we

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,670
do email related data gives you a nice

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,630
unified in American border very

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,329
convenient

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:24,220
doesn't cost you anything apart from the

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,660
privacy and it's you'll find the same

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,210
coordinates for example the fitness

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:33,960
trackers and most of all you're looking

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,960
at applies to

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:41,270
finally we have a there even if

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:50,630
you just look at travel related data for

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:54,700
example a lot of financial details your

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:59,930
credit card number movement for clients

00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:02,810
passport number so I mean this is as it

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:11,060
gets not necessarily something you want

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:13,000
to share is services so what can you do

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:17,120
about that

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,500
build our own alternative of course and

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,470
that's what we have been doing in the

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:26,390
specific area since the meeting last

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,600
year we actually have the first bits of

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,600
this

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,940
central server augmenting it respective

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:49,120
data data also compiled in so no network

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:57,550
access for this sent to your phone by

00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:01,120
active internet mobile application lying

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,400
here and I actually managed to pass the

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,680
security check with this is actually

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:13,620
well there's one big challenge to this

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:20,760
and this is getting life data no

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:25,200
resource for that we need to talk to a

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,200
full-scale talk on this tomorrow

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,609
[Applause]

00:06:49,099 --> 00:07:04,590
that's you what did you did you send me

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:08,569
okay so actually if we surround Anakin

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:12,300
we'll talk a little bit more about

00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:15,090
encryption and the encryption we

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,900
normally talk about is encrypting the

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,300
body here so crypting the content is one

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:26,659
solve the problem with new PGP and

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:30,719
s/mime but we have more data where we

00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:34,320
expose things we want to you don't want

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:37,940
to expose them and that are all the male

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:42,960
headers and they actually memory who

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,490
tries to make sure that also headers can

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,500
be encrypted

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,560
they actually encrypted also inside the

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,010
body

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,710
we have to extract them and but the

00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:00,300
problem is if we use came in for example

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:03,310
then yeah we see an encrypted block and

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,730
can't access the header so we don't see

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,740
from whom the male is and also the

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:15,940
subject isn't accessible without

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:19,870
decrypting the mail so from I'm trying

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:23,740
to solve this problem and deeply

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:26,560
decrypting the mail directly inside K

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,130
mail to expect the headers and display

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,669
them so that you can use them as an

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:38,430
unencrypted Mail and do like searching

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:42,460
because currently you can't search in

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:49,470
and if you encrypt the headers - it's

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:49,470
even worse than search from for subject

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,149
my name is Veronica and I will try and

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,560
form a company into it's only a bit hard

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,240
on all things related to Luigi and

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,370
mostly able to business distribution of

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,880
converge in a Cleopatra activity for

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:24,889
women so I was asked to talk a bit about

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:27,440
came in and fail because probably if you

00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:32,620
had read some technical news you have

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,470
heard of this as this was a huge story

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,269
where the Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,529
basically said people have to stop using

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:45,529
email crypto and uninstaller everything

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:51,019
which was very advanced especially

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:59,980
because a male was tested and shown to

00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:59,980
be and this is because secure

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,019
[Music]

00:10:24,629 --> 00:11:12,420
because basically like

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:46,660
the highest possible user to need to use

00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:49,180
key Arbitron user should know what

00:11:46,660 --> 00:12:13,689
certificate is for the key is to have

00:11:49,180 --> 00:12:19,019
basic protection that just came in

00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:19,019
already supporters so if you for example

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:31,710
he to use for performing and the next

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:35,730
big thing we want to have automated

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:41,040
trust so you don't have to sign as a

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,530
keys texting etc by tracking the

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,870
communication history if you have links

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,980
to key forces and versa for a long time

00:12:45,870 --> 00:13:03,330
then it's fine and yeah this is what

00:12:49,980 --> 00:13:05,580
we'll be working on next so that was all

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,530
a dive down in the stack but now we're

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,530
going to go broad and

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,920
they're stopped

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,740
[Applause]

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,640
[Music]

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:49,149
the plaza still users which which will

00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:49,149
which will be

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,879
[Music]

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,210
[Applause]
