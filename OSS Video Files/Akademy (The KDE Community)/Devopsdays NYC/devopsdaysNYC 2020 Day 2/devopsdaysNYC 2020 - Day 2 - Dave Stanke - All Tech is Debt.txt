Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 2 - Dave Stanke - All Tech is Debt
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: devopsdaysNYC 2020 Day 2
Description: 
	We all spend a lot of energy trying to discover tech debt, and eliminate it. Fat chance! In this talk, I will convince you that all tech is debt, and that it’s futile to try to live debt-free. Why? Because none of your tech is an asset; it’s all liability. From the minute it’s created, it’s already old. It has security vulnerabilities. It’s not idiomatic to whatever the latest trends are. It’s eating you from the inside! So what can you do about it? Throw away as much as you can. Let someone else build the rest. And most importantly, focus on your real assets: your people, your culture, your brand. Your customers! Technologists are an asset. But tech? That’s debt.

all tech is dead yes oh I know I've

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,390
built a ton of tech and it was all debt

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,860
and though I didn't build your tech I'm

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,579
telling you it's dead

00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,500
so he's yours and yours and these two

00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,820
yeesh

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:38,129
hi I'm Dave stanky and I'm a data holic

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,750
I've been a product manager a CTO a

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,329
developer I'm now a developer advocate

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:48,120
I've seen it all and it is all debt so

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,829
let's define what is tech debt well to

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,620
be honest it's a bit of uh I know it

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,540
when I see it right or maybe I know it

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,270
when I smell it it's the stuff that has

00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,989
that tech debt smell I like to think of

00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,790
it this way

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,220
tech that's the stuff where you open it

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:08,820
up and take a look and you say yeah I'm

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:10,560
gonna fix that later now in our industry

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,420
we spend a lot of time talking about

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
tech debt trying to figure out how to

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,009
isolate it identify it contain it

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,190
exterminate it but I got bad news for

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,920
you it's not gonna happen why because

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,310
all tech is dead okay we're not there

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,409
yet

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,130
but can we agree that in order not to be

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,799
dead Tech has to have some value well

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,270
let's take a look at our software most

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,909
of the stuff your customers don't know

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,729
about boilerplates and frameworks

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:42,540
that's not value or your business logic

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,790
okay that's important right except your

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,530
competitors have most of that too so

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,799
that's not really value that's the cost

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,060
of doing business you're differentiating

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,390
business logic the stuff that sets you

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,409
apart from the competitors okay that has

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,970
value but it's not dead right yeah

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,090
actually it is

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:07,229
why because tech is constantly changing

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,580
like all the time whatever the state of

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,099
the world was when you thought about

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,430
something by the time you've coded it

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,079
shipped it productionize dit at the

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,200
world has changed and so have best

00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:21,180
practices here's a tech debt smell when

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,370
you have to refigure out something

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,410
before you can make a change when is

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,240
that not the case when it's doing your

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,180
head

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,330
after it leaves your head it's long gone

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,040
and you got to reinterpret it or how

00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,290
about this what about when you can't

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,360
just go ahead and make a change when is

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,500
it that you can't do that when people

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,510
are using it

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:48,410
pesky users every user is more tech debt

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,180
in fact think about your worst nastiest

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,460
tech debt hairball that thing you just

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,640
want to chuck in the river why can't you

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,970
because it's important your business

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,240
needs it that dumpster fire is actually

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:05,390
your company's greatest asset but it's

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,750
worse than that not only is tech debt

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,600
tech is a ticking time bomb think about

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,610
a zero day exploit zero day is the day

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,760
that it got taken advantage of it was

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,590
already in your systems we're using our

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,170
continuous delivery systems to ship

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:25,790
exploits faster and faster out to our

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,710
users let's face it tech is a bad

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,030
investment

00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,970
think about the cell phone you bought

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,910
two years ago what did you spend five

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:38,780
hundred eight hundred one thousand forty

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,550
nine what's it worth now but I have good

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,310
news for you I'm going to tell you about

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,290
a surefire investment plan that cannot

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,620
lose step one

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,110
throw your tech away less tech means

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,930
less debt is there an open-source

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,870
version you can use use it or software

00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,590
as a service provider use it say thank

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,470
you for your service and step 2

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,510
break the wheel before you build

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,120
something stop and think am I making

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,070
this because I really need it because I

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,460
like building things because that

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,690
feeling of accomplishment is fleeting

00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,730
debt is forever

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,160
do you like whirring how about this

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,870
worry about your customer service people

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,510
who are tearing their hair out trying to

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,040
paper over your future gaps or worry

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,930
about your engineers or getting ulcers

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,780
trying to make the perfect debt-free

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,500
software that's never gonna happen

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,690
because before it's new it's already old

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,850
your only hope is to have a great team

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,310
that can respond to conditions and ship

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,400
things to users quickly get value before

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,770
it's completely unmaintainable which

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,280
brings us to step three invest in your

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,020
team they pay dividends so invest in a

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,090
culture of learning invest in a team

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,600
that trusts each other knows each other

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:03,040
and is prepared to learn together

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:07,180
because in the end tech is debt burn it

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,070
people are gold cherish them and I'm

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,860
Dave and that's my time thank you

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:25,160
[Applause]

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:25,160
