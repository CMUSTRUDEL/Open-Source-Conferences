Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 1 - Jaana B. Dogan - Are you ready for production?
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: devopsdaysNYC 2020 Day 1
Description: 
	Maintaining production systems can be a burden, especially for those who havenâ€™t been doing it for a long time. Knowledge is lost when people leave, practices are only put in place when needed, and onboarding new people can take a long time. In this talk, we will go through production readiness principles and cover the recent technical and organization shift in various organizations when it comes to pushing new components to production systems. Production readiness sometimes requires collaboration from several teams and it influences change from design to late-time operational practices. This talk will examine practices from design & development, configuration management, observability, release management, capacity planning, security and compliance. After this talk, you will have better practical skills to keep your production happy and your engineers more stress-free when they are deploying production services.

This talk will explain achieving production maturity via manual/automated checks, knowledge share, production readiness reviews and organizational rethinking. After giving motivation why production readiness is important, it will give an example of Google PRR system with a concrete example from Youtube.

	00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,270
hello good morning you know hey i think

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,770
i'm not like the person who should give

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,390
this talk because i'm not ready for

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,490
production myself today i actually came

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,230
here to ask you this question ai ready

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,769
for production it turned out to be a

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,140
self-deprecating joke i guess before we

00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:38,059
get into that question i just want to

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,050
like see some hands can you even tell if

00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:44,930
you can answer this question very few

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,460
hands yeah that's normal

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,590
i actually as you know it's a side note

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,940
I'm working for Google but some of the

00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,969
practice and some of the practices I

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,739
will explain you today are from our

00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:02,120
practices but these are like more

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:04,820
industry-wide practices and tools so I

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,130
say production I first need to explain

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,869
my emotional state about production I

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,119
think for a very long time

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:13,520
production has always been a scary word

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,930
to me who's maintaining production

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,509
services here a lot of ends who feels

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,099
nervous when pushing new stuff to

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,270
production or launching a new service

00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,959
again a plenty of hands and that's

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,679
normal

00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:33,560
although it's not ideal production is

00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:35,270
the environment we often end up having

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,890
some anxiety especially if you're

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,099
working for the wrong company with the

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,390
wrong tools and the wrong practices

00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,429
production can be an intimidating place

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,770
if you are new beginner in the industry

00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,989
if you don't have any experience you

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,869
feel like you may feel judged

00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:53,450
if you fail and I was not you know the

00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:55,459
person I always was today for many years

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,099
our production environments have always

00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:01,280
been so intimidating for me that I

00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:03,410
always try to stay away you know even

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,750
though they are very critical and that's

00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,069
like a you know terrible cycle right you

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,879
don't want to touch to something

00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:13,879
critical but you know that it's critical

00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,980
so when you're involved in activities

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,319
with production there are a lot of

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,209
questions you have the first question

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,850
obvious is when you're launching

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,230
especially a new service are you ready

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,060
to push the things to production

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,690
and then how can you tell what is good

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,540
or bad or how can you tell who is to

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,720
determine who is bad and what is good or

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,849
bad to do in production how do we

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,430
transfer knowledge you know it's not

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:43,140
just like when things go wrong if things

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,519
are successful you also want to be able

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,650
to transfer that knowledge so it's

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,170
repeated and how do we learn from

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,379
failure right if what is the best way

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,180
what is the best channel because of all

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,510
these questions and the you know the

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,879
anxiety nature of it it turns out to be

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,799
an intimidating place and sometimes

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,769
you're consumed by the production

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,879
anxiety a while ago I've been introduced

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,849
to this concept called

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,220
production redness and some reviews this

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,769
is actually a very simple practice that

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,049
ensures two things the first one is a

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,269
service should meet some standards of

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,400
operational readiness and the second

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,410
thing is teams can benefit from this

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,739
organization wide knowledge share

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,329
through the readiness and the production

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,470
readiness practice is coming with a

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:33,209
review system which are called PRRS and

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,940
I'll talk a little bit about both of

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,849
them so we ideally think that the

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,130
reviews can be done not only for once

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:44,700
but for many times in the lifecycle of a

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,019
service I think the first one mentioned

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,730
here is very obvious when you're

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,769
launching a new production service yes

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,079
you want to take a look and review if

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,609
it's ready for production the second

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,169
case is when you're introduced in

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,000
production readiness to an existing

00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,400
service it's also very obvious because

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,500
you know you want to review if they're

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,940
ready for production but they are also

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,849
useful when you're handing off the

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,040
operations to a different team or when

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,599
you're handing off operations to new

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,790
individuals on your team when your own

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,889
boarding people it would be nice to be

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,039
able to see hey if the service is really

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,900
like meeting with our standards and you

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,549
can just make sure that everybody speaks

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,520
the same language and everybody's on the

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,250
same page by doing the review the other

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,680
case is when you're preparing on call

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,260
support especially if this is requiring

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,169
collaboration with other teams as well

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,409
as some wider collaboration from the

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,499
company you can still sit down and

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:44,279
review what is there

00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:47,099
so I mentioned the reviews is a part of

00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,749
this practice and the reviews can often

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:51,659
be expressed as some sort of like

00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:53,699
checklist this checklist for example is

00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:56,759
a very high-level overview it touches a

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,110
bunch of subcategories it tells you a

00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,389
bunch of things that you can do at

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,379
design development you know these are

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,529
the things that you should do for

00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:07,349
configuration release management and so

00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,689
on you may have more topics or you may

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,819
have less topics and I will pretty soon

00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:14,969
explain us give you some concrete

00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,490
examples of what can be put in a

00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:20,699
checklist but first let me briefly

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,909
discuss why these reviews are useful so

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,819
the first thing is companies often end

00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:29,129
up having practices around production in

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,409
a very organic way you know you start a

00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,639
company it just grows eventually there

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,979
are different teams doing different

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,779
things each team is trying to you know

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,360
figure out what is the best practice

00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,629
with trial and error most of the case

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,829
and this reality often has a cost just

00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,719
because everybody is trying to do it

00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:48,079
with trial and error it creates this

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:52,829
like culture where there's more blame so

00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:55,949
people are you know looking for 'men

00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:57,360
tria lee you know it kind of is working

00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,059
against the confidence of the

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,449
practitioners because everything is by

00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:05,519
trial and error also engineers don't

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,369
feel you know confident enough to push

00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:13,889
the production which is affecting the

00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:16,919
release velocity and this you know both

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:19,379
trial and error culture calls and

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:24,659
fingerprinting and that anxiety of like

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:27,419
having to fail is not really ideal so

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:30,300
production readiness is not a very magic

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,429
tool but it actually helps reviews can

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,059
be a checklist as or a questionnaire

00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:39,059
that I as I explained they can be done

00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:41,550
manually or automatically in most cases

00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:43,199
people try to do them both you know

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,969
there are like some tedious stuff that

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,550
you can look for you can do them

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,620
automatically or there are a lot of like

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,810
complex things you might be looking for

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,920
and you can do them manually

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,930
organizations can produce a checklist

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,320
templates rather than giving a people

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,200
giving people a static list of things so

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,840
they can each team can inherit some

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,910
knowledge by taking the template but

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,980
they can also have the flexibility of

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,120
adding new items that are relevant to

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,220
them now I want to show you a checklist

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,169
and give you some examples of what can

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,870
be put there but please see this as a

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:22,300
reference this is not like the ultimate

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,030
thing or whatever is just some sort of

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,669
like an influence and showing is like

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,970
you know what is the format and what

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,800
what is what could be there in fact a

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,140
while ago I had published something very

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,150
similar as a guideline for google cloud

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,440
customers so it's a service provider

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,840
it's very interesting for us because

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,970
there are all these like gaps you know

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,100
in knowledge when it comes to production

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:49,210
practices and there's not a good way for

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,700
us to present it we need to sometimes

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,310
give some tool or like productions

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,160
product suggestions but you know there's

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,430
not easy way to explain the broader

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,010
picture so this production guideline is

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,120
kind of like helping our customers to

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,770
see oh these are like the critical

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,110
things that you should go through and

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,150
like consider so even though I kept

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,010
talking in this scope of a single

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,919
organization or a company these

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,390
checklists can be actually useful across

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,400
the companies let's start digging into a

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,810
example checklist so I said that there

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,270
could be you know multiple categories

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,360
design and development is one of them

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,039
this is where you can say all of like

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,219
you know your best practices you know

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,140
have reproducible builds SLO like you're

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,570
giving people the guidance what they

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,000
should do at design and development and

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,310
this section ideally really helps the

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,220
development to make the development team

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,650
to make better better decision better

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,960
design decisions and if you can actually

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:55,089
help them with the trade-offs and

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:57,430
everything people love it so the list

00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,800
actually looks more of like this you

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,890
have like these different items but each

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,870
of them has more of like a section where

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,970
you explain why

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,220
this best practices around this is the

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,410
rationale this is like the historical

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,620
reason why we ended up doing this and

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,280
then on top of that for each item you

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,320
usually like provide some deliverables

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,720
for this type of project let's please

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,370
make sure that this is done and the

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,830
second thing is done and the third thing

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,990
is done so you don't necessarily just

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,050
give them a like a simple list you also

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,000
provide people rational and deliverable

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,850
so they are actionable and there is

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,520
historical knowledge this is a section

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,460
for configuration there's a lot of like

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,350
you know debates around whether to use

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,660
flags or environmental variables or

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,220
configuration management tools this is a

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,100
place where you can express the best

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,740
practice you know like it's simple best

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,600
practices small static non secret

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,370
configuration can be Flags everything

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,710
else should come from the configuration

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,450
management for a new person who's just

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,040
coming to your company it doesn't need

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,750
to know about this but they can go

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,810
through this list to understand what's

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,370
going on you can explain what is static

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,710
or what is dynamic

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,840
you know what development environment

00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,570
configuration should do with the

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,940
production one to avoid like misuses and

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,610
so on so it's a good place to represent

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,040
all of that release management can touch

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,690
a bunch of things but they're usually

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,210
touching the fundamentals you know

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,700
document things including your cannery

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,160
releases and how to you know revert

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,950
canneries make sure you don't use a

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,630
different process for all out compared

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,700
to like rollback so you know they've

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,370
they should go through the same pipeline

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,320
for a newcomer it might be not that this

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,080
might not be obvious but once you

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,540
represented here everybody has to go

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,980
through the same practice observer

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,110
ability is a huge topic where you can

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,710
put some pointers here even for people

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,660
who absolutely no understanding they can

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,950
have like enough you know they can see

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:05,470
the initial pointers a very common

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,000
example of this is for example lots of

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,570
people haven't heard about distributed

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,760
tracing but you have to at least like

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,740
propagate the incoming tracing header in

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,220
order to you know make the entire thing

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,970
work

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,769
if you put it in the checklist here

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,720
necessarily have to know about it but

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:27,480
you can read about it and it's a really

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:30,329
good pointer security is a huge topic

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,610
but you know high-level overview and

00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:35,040
policies can be represented here maybe

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,319
they can act as like some of the you

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,810
know the pointers you can say you know

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,230
how you should encrypt the traffic you

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,600
can say like how you should isolate

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,730
resources or have to monitor user data

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,980
lookups or how to limit access to a

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,480
bunch of things even though it's pretty

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,759
obvious you know we commonly know in

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,519
quite of an example of this is a lot of

00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:04,009
times people forget that like debugging

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:08,550
endpoints require a different you know

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:10,290
ACL and it's just so much easier when

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,329
you put this on the list so it's a

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,980
reminder for you even though we all know

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,170
that like it's it's really obvious in

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,560
common practice we usually forget about

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,870
them so you know it goes to the

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,059
checklist again you can mention about

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,980
input sanitization you can talk about

00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,629
payload restrictions you can make sure

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,809
that like you can block the incoming

00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,970
traffic by user and so on all these like

00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:35,309
other cases that contributes the abuse

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,610
can be put here because some of them are

00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:41,370
actual design time decisions you have to

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:45,389
really be prepared and design things in

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:47,970
a specific way capacity planning is one

00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,529
of them nobody really documents but you

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,019
know checklist is a good way to do this

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,699
and it's you know capital planning is

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,290
really crucial for the sustainability of

00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:57,649
your service so document resource

00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,149
requirements document limitations

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,769
document the need for the Tetlow testing

00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,889
and what it takes to low test

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:07,050
if you care about low testing if you

00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,660
like the idea of readiness the next step

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,309
is I think where you want to start the

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,889
first thing is I think acknowledging

00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:16,019
this as a team the solo attempts are

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:19,439
likely to fail because this is more of

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,629
like a team right you know practice so

00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:23,790
try to acknowledge the need as a team

00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,529
and try to do something about it the

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,420
second thing you can start to research

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,730
practices that apply to you you can take

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,220
a look at the reference practice you

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:35,509
know tools are

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,699
checklists like that I shared but you

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:40,610
can also consult your domain experts

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:43,100
especially if you have a specific you

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,829
know expertise in a specific domain it's

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,259
really important I think incorporate

00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:51,529
like involve some of the experts early

00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:54,079
and start having production redness

00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:56,420
discussions early as soon as early as

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,120
soon as you start actually designing the

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,040
system because if you introduce this

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,810
type of practices as a later time

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,050
exercise I think they're seen as a

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,610
burden if you involve them early it

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,310
really helps people to do the right

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,860
decisions try to learn from failure and

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,009
share knowledge directly this is widely

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,939
this is a way to the checklists are a

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:22,699
way to deliver knowledge they are a

00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:24,410
channel to deliver the knowledge and

00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,850
when you're acknowledging the need as a

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,300
team I think this is one of the

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,490
strongest points and if possible try to

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,410
enforce production readiness practices

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,050
all across so everybody speaks the same

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:42,100
language there's one more thing please

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:45,110
don't stop evaluating the review process

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,230
review and iterate each item even the

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,209
process itself when adding new items to

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,870
the review always provide the rationale

00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:56,089
as I have shown an example remove the

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,029
items if they are not relevant at all

00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:03,170
and always you know feel free to ask for

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:06,199
assistance to review the reviews itself

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,480
so you get different opinions and share

00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,230
more of like you know the industry-wide

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,139
knowledge through this way production

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,480
readiness is should be discussed when

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,970
you are initially designed a new service

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,250
it's often it's often becoming a burden

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,319
if you try to comply with these

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,769
practices at a later time

00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:30,319
so checklists should provide insights

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,809
you know to engineers the right to make

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:36,170
the right decisions so try to do this

00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:39,439
early as possible try to include them in

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,990
the design dots as well one of the fair

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,370
concerns from everyone is like hey this

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,260
is like additional prod

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,810
and it's actually going to work against

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,820
us when implemented carefully it

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,940
shouldn't readiness should really

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,970
increase your velocity because you know

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,910
it's helping with you with design in

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,680
development the second thing is when

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,240
you're troubleshooting you actually have

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,820
a better understanding of what is

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,410
already there and you are following some

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,450
of the practices that will help with

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,430
your troubleshooting and the third one

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,500
is when others are joining to your team

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,000
you're just handing off risk or you are

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,370
handing off responsible is used to a

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,670
different team you actually have like

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,990
some sort of they know what is there so

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,360
it really helps to you know the

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,750
knowledge transfer to different teams as

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,630
well so to recap we realize that

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,720
production readiness helps helps teams

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,750
to be more confident reduce everyday

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,150
mistakes and help onboarding new

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,300
individuals we don't really see people

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,090
you know saying I know what I'm doing

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,030
but you know the checklist can actually

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:51,490
like help them to feel a little bit more

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:53,600
confidence about what they do and they

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,290
understand the success and they

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,480
understand the fail modes better you can

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,840
do the review either manually or

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,330
automatically as I said it's always it's

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,130
not always possible to do everything

00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:10,880
automatically so try to do all the

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:15,740
tedious things automatically and do the

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,410
other stuff manually if you don't reduce

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,140
this bothersome repetitive tasks I think

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,820
people end up abandoning these practices

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,490
because it's sort of like some

00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,740
additional you know there there's not

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,960
much value maybe coming from them like

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,760
they see that it's it's so much work so

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,950
much process and there's not much value

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,410
coming from them so making it least

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,380
tedious is less tedious is very

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,960
important when introduces a later time

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,900
policy or compliance this is really

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,670
making it harder for everyone instead

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,060
try to you know do it as early as

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:53,090
possible you should really make people -

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,680
you should really make everyone -

00:17:53,090 --> 00:18:00,410
you should help people with the design

00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:04,980
trade-offs so you know if the reviews

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:09,570
can help them practically practically in

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:13,230
the lifecycle of the entire thing people

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:16,050
love them people like them and don't

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:19,290
like their bond on them it is really

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,000
important concern to understand that you

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,310
know readiness could be a process burden

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,350
so try to measure it try you know we

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,320
often say that like oh if the maturity

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,450
is higher the release velocity is going

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,420
to get you know higher but try to you

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,790
know measure it the cost of you know

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,250
having no readiness reviews is not ideal

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,470
either repeated mistakes and missing

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,950
knowledge gaps can be improved

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,480
significantly with this thing and

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,490
repeated mistakes is also like creating

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,560
this trial error culture where it

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,200
contributes to more of like a blame full

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,180
engineering culture so you know give

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,440
this a try and try to see how it's

00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,760
actually impacting you most importantly

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,710
you know this is not about just like

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,780
checks in some boxes this is not about

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,570
it in some process this is about sharing

00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,000
knowledge by reading production

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,220
readiness checklist I've learned a lot

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,770
about the team I learned a lot about an

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,750
organization it actually gives me a way

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,670
to say that like I really want to work

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,470
with this team or not sometimes it's

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,100
just more about them you know chicks in

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,090
some box checking some boxes try to keep

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,490
the you know the process also

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,470
lightweight as possible as I said that

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,480
try to measure it just like in

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,970
everything else abandon it if you don't

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,000
find any clear value for your specific

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,890
case because otherwise people likely to

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,780
see readiness nothing but an arbitrary

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:43,440
process that it's nothing but some

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,690
additional cost production readiness can

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,660
be a powerful tool if you ask me when

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:52,800
you implement it carefully to try to

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,260
consider it that's all I have for today

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,300
thanks for joining I'm wishing you a

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,700
happy production I try to wash your

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,880
hands and I'm so sorry for not being

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,620
production ready

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:19,920
[Applause]

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:19,920
