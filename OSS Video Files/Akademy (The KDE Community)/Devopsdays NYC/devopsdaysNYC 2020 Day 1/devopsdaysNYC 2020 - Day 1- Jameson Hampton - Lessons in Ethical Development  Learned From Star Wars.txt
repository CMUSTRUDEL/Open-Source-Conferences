Description: 
	Lessons in Ethical Development I Learned From Star Wars

As developers, we solve problems. Working on interesting problems and solving interesting puzzles is where many of us get our job satisfaction. It’s easy to get caught up in that feeling, always pushing forward and asking ourselves “Can we build it?” Unfortunately, that can often overshadow an even more important question: “Should we build it?”

Engineering ethics has been a hot ticket item in tech lately, but it can be a difficult topic to talk about. It’s much easier to think about our code and our work as amoral because it relieves us of the pressure of always considering the ethical implications of the things we build. But that sets a dangerous precedent! Our actions have consequences and throughout history, good people have done work that they’ve later regretted after they’ve seen the impact that it has on our society. This is particularly important for developers to consider in the current political climate, when there is a lot of work out there that may not align with our ideas about what’s ethical and what’s not. Being in the right mindset to consider these factors and make informed decisions about what we feel comfortable working on is extremely important!

Ethics is a heavy topic and because of that, it can be helpful to discuss it through the lens of stories from fiction, rather than getting bogged down in real life examples that might be too depressing or scary. That’s where Star Wars comes in! Star Wars is a story about good and evil and the bridge in between the two. Nearly all of the villains in Star Wars were heroes originally and then accidentally became villains along the way by succumbing to the temptation of the dark side. The Rogue One story is particularly relevant to us as developers and engineers, as it shows how someone like us can end up working for an employer like the Empire and building a project like the Death Star. Many of those engineers did not realize they were working on a superweapon when they joined that project and the realization of how easy it can be to lure in talented devs with the promise of interesting work was eye-opening.

hi as Janice said my talk is called

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,350
lessons and ethical development I

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,730
learned for the Star Wars I just want to

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,400
introduce myself real fast

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,270
my name is Jamison Hampton my friends

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,000
call me Jamie

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,590
I'm here from Buffalo New York the home

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,540
of bad sports I did this talk recently

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,020
on Australia and that joke did not get a

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,430
laugh there so I'm pleased it's possible

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,050
if you recognize my voice

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,820
it's because I'm a panelist on greater

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,769
than code it's a podcast about like

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,530
technology and the human side and how it

00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:51,330
means and you can also find me on

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,909
Twitter at Jamie Bash feel free to

00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,680
friend me send me memes tweet about my

00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,150
talk the only thing I ask is I'd use

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,739
they pronouns so if you're gonna talk

00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,100
about me publicly please keep that in

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,900
mind and now that we're all friends the

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,659
other thing that you would know being my

00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,030
friend is that I love Star Wars like a

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,119
lot in fact my talk is a spoiler warning

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,880
um there are major spoilers for rogue

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,280
one that came out several years ago and

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,799
also has been spoiled since 1977 they

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,869
get the death star plans at the end I'm

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,329
also gonna do spoilers first Star Wars

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,039
rebels there were minor spoilers for

00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,750
last Jedi but I'm not actually going to

00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:30,210
talk about the rise of Skywalker so no

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,140
worries I did have someone walk out one

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,969
time but my spoiler warning so I'm gonna

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,640
talk about ethics you know ethics has

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,990
been a hot ticket item in tech I'm sure

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,570
you're aware of this if you're in tech

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,249
or if you've ever been on Twitter before

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,329
I like this question I think it's really

00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:48,060
interesting this is from the

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,189
stackoverflow developer survey do you

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,200
believe that you have an obligation to

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,840
consider the ethical implications of the

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,549
code that you write my first instinct to

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,530
this question was that like this is

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,020
there's an objectively right answer to

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,429
this isn't there isn't this obvious but

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,229
Pablo Hidalgo is one of the producers

00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:09,149
for Star Wars and as he says every time

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,100
you think something is obvious it's

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,569
helpful to reminder to remember that

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,290
this is the Twitter that needs reminders

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:18,990
that the Empire were the bad guys so I

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,430
kind of walked right into that one but

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,990
apparently it's not obvious because it's

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,340
something that comes up in our industry

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,940
a lot and I think it's something that's

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,090
important to talk about and I'm going to

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,709
talk about some of it in late

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,180
the context of rogue one I really love

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,310
rogue one and I was really excited when

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,459
it was coming out I was like I'm gonna

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,170
go to the theater I'm gonna see like

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,400
they're these marginalized people and

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,690
they're fighting against the man I'm

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,370
gonna relate to them and it's gonna be

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,900
amazing but then I came home and I was

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,120
like oh my gosh what am i doing because

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,530
it's not what happened the person I

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,450
related to most in Oregon was this

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,040
character who even if you haven't seen

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,480
the movie you can tell that he's a

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,239
villain because he's wearing a white

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,860
cape and so I had this kind of

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,730
realization about myself and it got me

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,010
thinking because Star Wars is pretty a

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,739
pretty classic story about good and evil

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,000
like in fact what first glance maybe you

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,250
don't have a lot of room for like

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,049
neutrality if you've never seen Star

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,549
Wars again you can look at this picture

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,700
and you know who the good guys are and

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,079
who the bad guys are and so it makes me

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,150
feel like okay well you know I don't

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,519
think I'm a bad person

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,569
so I'm not gonna do any bad stuff no

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,549
worries check done but obviously life's

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,349
not like that and somewhere along the

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,010
line I got feeling like okay well it's

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:34,930
not really this simple this is a tweet

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,660
servants actually from just after 2016

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,040
team in the presidential election Kate

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,200
Crawford is really smart and you should

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,810
follow her and read all of her stuff but

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,730
she had this these tweets about talking

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,410
about developers being asked to build

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,380
something that's unethical and rarely

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,329
talking about it the tech industry she

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,370
said already builds tools for predictive

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:56,859
policing criminal justice risk scores

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,750
tracking refugees will you be the one to

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,849
build the Muslim registry or work on

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,169
locating undocumented workers or deploy

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,139
facial recognition to identify

00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:07,690
protesters talk about your bright lines

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,880
she said and this really got me thinking

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,639
it really kind of made me start to

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,099
realize that not everything is so

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,049
unambiguous as it seems in Star Wars

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,209
good people do bad things sometimes for

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,349
misguided reasons sometimes because they

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,840
don't think about it and they don't

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,880
realize what they're doing and the more

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,910
I started to think about how there was a

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,229
lot of room for ambiguity here I

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,150
realized that even in Star Wars it's

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,470
maybe not as unambiguous as the first

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,969
seems because this guy Darth Vader

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,480
actually this guy Anakin Skywalker

00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:43,760
spoilers um

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,530
he was a war hero in the Clone Wars in

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,020
fact pretty much all the villains and

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,120
Star Wars were originally heroes people

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,520
who like became villains because of the

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,810
temptation of the darkside or because

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,960
they were tricked by the dark side

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,870
because people are easy to trick but

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,580
even if you're not like a villain like

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,540
you're a Jedi you know you're good you

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,190
don't have to worry forever

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,690
that's totally not how it works in Star

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,940
Wars either all of the good guys who

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,150
stay good face temptation to you've got

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,870
Luke Skywalker Darth Vader comes like I

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,580
am your father

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,040
let's rule the galaxy together like

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,110
that's pretty tempting I like Ray's

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,030
story in particular because like she had

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,310
just found out that she was a force user

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,770
and she didn't know like how to deal

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,090
with that and then kylo ren comes and

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,160
he's like i can teach you how to use

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,560
this like come with me i think that

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,570
would be really tempting i'm a really

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,780
big star mercenary we've got as refriger

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,180
form as rebels who is tempted by power

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,760
obi-wan who was tempted by love even

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,770
even Master Yoda had to face temptation

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,540
if Master Yoda has to deal with it then

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,950
we all have to deal with it so I would

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,440
actually want to stalk specifically

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,540
about catalyst it's the like prequel

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,930
novel to Roland I told you I'm a nerd

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,220
I'm sorry but if you haven't read it

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,520
that's okay because I'll tell you what

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,070
happened in it it was about or syncretic

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,320
on the character from my earlier slide

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,450
he was the director of advanced weapons

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,770
research and then this is Galen or so he

00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,720
was the lead engineer on the Death Star

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,850
project characters you may recognise if

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,260
you've seen rogue one and it's kind of a

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,420
book about them in their backstory they

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,400
knew each other from college Galen was

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,020
like a known pacifist he didn't want to

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
work for the government at all but

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,660
cronic knew he was going to need him on

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,120
this project because he was the

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,580
authority on crystallography like high

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,260
rehearsals and so he was grooming him he

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,960
knew that it was his dream to work on

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,070
renewable energy and so he like

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,720
manipulated him with all these promises

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,670
of that he told these horror stories

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,220
about the Clone Wars like you could help

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,050
end them with your research and so

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,120
ultimately Galen starts working on

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,160
project celestial power that's what it

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,660
was originally called

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,400
and didn't he didn't know how his work

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,900
was being implemented for like many

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,240
years this was before the events of

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,680
rogue one

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,229
and this quote really was the one that

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,409
got to me this was Galen's mentor

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:02,330
speaking to him and she said the war has

00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:04,610
altered everything not only for those

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,099
directly involved but also many of us

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,659
here on Khorasan Count Dooku's shook us

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,490
awake to a harsh reality and most of us

00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,889
have traded theory for practicality but

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,020
even so unlimited funding has been

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,669
wonderful for research in due time we

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,800
can return to our dream of providing

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,300
renewable energy and we'll be able to

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,909
accomplish much more than we ever could

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,889
before so I was reading this book and I

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,020
was like this sounds great like I was

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,180
almost feeling frustrated with Galen for

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,669
not wanting to take this job and then I

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,440
was like oh no this is the Deathstar

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,610
project I even knew it was the Death

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,919
Star project because I know how this

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,960
ends and I still would have gotten

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,360
tricked so that was my kind of wake-up

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,969
like I would have gotten tricked to work

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,409
on the Death Star project and so I was

00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,870
like oh no I haven't thought about this

00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:50,479
at all like I haven't may be assigned a

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,669
sense of morality to my work and if you

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,129
think of your work as a morale not like

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,650
immoral but just like amoral unrelated

00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,000
to morality it's dangerous because you

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,270
might not realize that you're treading

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,210
into like dangerous waters so it got me

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,520
thinking about self accountability it's

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,219
too easy to be like it's a great great

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,719
opportunity why not the moment that

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,190
you're faced with an ethical dilemma is

00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:15,620
not the good time to start thinking

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,880
about where your line is if you think

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,919
about these things before they happen

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,759
you're less likely to get into that trap

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,409
of like yeah it sounds great and you

00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,870
also shouldn't feel obligated to make

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:29,240
big decisions immediately I think it's

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,029
always okay to take time to think about

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,250
any big decisions in your life and I

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,260
particularly think that people who don't

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,940
want to give you that time to think

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,260
about it I might not trust those people

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,610
and this is also kind of what Kay

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,500
Crawford was getting at but write things

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,390
down when you're thinking about your

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,000
moral code take notes on your thoughts

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,160
if I'm faced with the decision suddenly

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm probably not deep in thought about

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,089
ethics right at that moment so I find it

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,130
really helpful to be able to look back

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,220
on my thoughts from a time when I was

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,810
deep in thought about it fix

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,610
holding yourself accountable really

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,020
means not doing bad things even as a

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,150
joke

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,620
I made this graphic a while ago and I

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,230
post it on the internet cuz thought it

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,480
was really funny I still do

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,710
that's not my information in the example

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,260
cuz I'm not an idiot I ended up taking

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,240
it down because I realized that like if

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,680
even one person fell for it and posted

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,350
their information and then someone else

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,750
stole their identity that's kind of on

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,930
me I still put it in my slides like I'm

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:37,670
not perfect I read a lot while I was on

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,410
researching for this about like a

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,570
process for making ethical decisions

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,680
because I talked a lot about this idea

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,960
that we have to think about our

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,150
decisions and it can be really helpful

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,440
to have guidelines so these guidelines I

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,690
think are really helpful they're from

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,430
Michael Davis he's a philosophy

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,600
professor at the Illinois Institute of

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:59,360
Technology and he has this seven step

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,510
process so I'm going to go through the

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,280
steps step number one state the problem

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,540
that could be something like I don't

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,300
know this makes me feel kind of

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,480
uncomfortable or how could this work be

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,580
misused in some way then check the facts

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,410
some problems really disappear once you

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,490
look at all the facts but others become

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,700
bigger identify relevant factors this

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,900
might be people involved laws

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:28,010
professional codes you have to adhere to

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,870
or practical constraints you have to

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,210
develop a list of all your options that

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,920
you can go through them and then test

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,930
the options I think this is the really

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,120
interesting one he goes through several

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:42,950
different tests like thought experiments

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,360
you can do the colleague test like might

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,600
would my colleagues agree with my

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,940
decision on this the harm test does this

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,200
cause less harm than the alternatives

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,420
would the publicity test could would I

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,030
want my choice about this published

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,970
publicly in a newspaper the

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,740
defensibility test could I defend my

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,680
choice against a committee if I had to

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,850
what would I say the reversibility test

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,490
is actually my favorite I think it's

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,190
really interesting would I still think

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,890
that this was a good idea if it ended up

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,920
affecting me negatively on a personal

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,920
level

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,110
after you've thought about all these

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,050
things you do have to ultimately make a

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,600
choice but that's not the last step the

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,240
last step is review your choice how do I

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,550
feel about my choice after the fact how

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,620
can I prevent someone else from having

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,620
to make a choice like this in the future

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,620
I think this is really relevant to some

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,840
stuff that happened in the last Jedi

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,280
this was a magazine that came out like a

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,220
week before the last Jedi that said

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,960
Khenpo get along with his new boss and

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:58,020
then I saw it and I was like nope but

00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,340
it's interesting to think about Poe

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,890
Dameron because I think he's like a

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,630
legitimately good person I really think

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,490
that he has the best interest of like

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,710
the rebellion in heart but he messes up

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,000
really big in the last Jedi because he

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,650
makes all of these decisions and he

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,080
didn't have all the information ends up

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,630
making them vulnerable and so the fact

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,910
is that like you can truly believe that

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,650
you're doing the right thing and you can

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,050
still mess it up especially if you don't

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,460
have all the information it's what

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,870
happened here and actually it's kind of

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,140
what happened in the rogue ones story

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:32,310
too so that's why I think like reviewing

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,620
the choice is so important and it gave

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,120
me lessons about the ethical process the

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
first one is the lesson from Poe you

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,600
should get as much information as you

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,380
can before making a rash decision that's

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,820
in the early stages of the step process

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,650
but I think there's more I think if

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,720
you're in a position of power it's

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,800
important to consider transparency with

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,440
the people with the people that you work

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,850
with yes Poe made mistakes but if

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,490
Admiral Hall dough had been more open

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,040
about the plan she also may have been

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,050
able to make those mistake prevent those

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,220
four mistakes from happening letting

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,170
others around you see the whole picture

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,510
enables them to make more ethical

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,070
decisions too because the steps don't

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,530
really work if they don't have all of

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,830
the information and that's part of self

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,480
accountability in a way and maybe

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,640
despite your best efforts you're still

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,500
going to screw up and so the lesson from

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,810
Yoda in the last Jedi is the greatest

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,670
teacher failure is that's why the

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,410
reviewer choice is the last step if you

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,450
mess up you have to make peace with it

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,960
the only thing you can do is try to make

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,960
it better in the future

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,620
this is a tweet from a friend of mine

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,800
and she says the question should always

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,720
be should we build the thing not can we

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,700
build the thing I believe we can build

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,350
mostly anything but knowing how

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,240
something fits in our society and how it

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,760
will impact us requires more nuance

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,030
I think it's developers we tend to get

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,100
very caught up in this like can we do it

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,900
can we figure it out there's an

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,680
interesting problem there's a puzzle I'm

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,020
gonna solve it I get that I feel that

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,520
way but the time to realize that the

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,380
thing you've built or helped build is

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:13,490
horrible it's not after you've already

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:15,540
made it this slide is called woe-is-me

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,330
because it's not just in fiction that

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,100
this happens nonfiction is like more

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,570
depressing to talk about which is why we

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,310
were gonna mainly talk about star wars

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,090
but I think it's important to note that

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,380
like this is like real life stuff the

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,120
slide is called what was me because

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,260
that's a quote that Einstein said after

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,390
he heard about what happened at

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,820
Hiroshima he didn't actually even work

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,610
on the atomic bomb but he did his

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,700
research supported it and so he had like

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,690
you know regret about that McHale

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,520
kalisch Kalashnikov invented the ak-47

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,990
he felt a lot of responsibility for the

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,810
people who died at the hands of his

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,400
invention he said before he died that he

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:59,340
wished that he had done farming instead

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:02,130
and camryn log bin did invent they came

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,780
up with the chemical for pepper spray it

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,420
was meant to be used as a weapon but

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,850
after seeing how it was used he

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,710
regretted being a part of that he said I

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:14,400
have never seen such an inappropriate

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,020
and improper use of chemical agents so

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,500
this is like real stuff kind of like

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,740
this size of a downer but it's like

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,330
important to remember that you can't

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,720
control how other people will use your

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,430
work once it's out in the world it's out

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,130
in the world and it's hard for you to

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,780
stop kind of the flow of that that's

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,700
particularly true in our industry

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,020
because code is like very easy to

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,810
repurpose so like once you decide what

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,459
is important to you you have

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,139
think about like what other technologies

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,819
are similar enough to the what you're

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:50,839
working on that they could be repurposed

00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:53,089
what do I mean by that so an example I

00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,670
like to use is again this wasn't one of

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,170
Kay Crawford's examples actually facial

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,709
recognition software that would identify

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,050
protesters well maybe you've decided

00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,309
like I'm totally against that I don't

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,519
want to work at a company that's doing

00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:11,180
this like I've drawn my line on that

00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:13,069
well if so maybe working on like a RG

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,170
video games that use facial recognition

00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:17,329
might also be something that you don't

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,660
want to do this is from The Hunger Games

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:22,519
IRG I do want to note that this is based

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,930
on how important it is to you I've had a

00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,839
couple people come up to me after and

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,920
say like I don't think the videogame

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,660
metaphor was a good example like I don't

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,949
think it's reasonable to put video games

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,170
off the table personally I disagree but

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,089
if you have considered the application

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,040
the implications and you've decided that

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,449
like you fought it through and you don't

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,649
want to turn it down like I'm not really

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:45,379
here to try and change your mind about

00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,850
it I just think it's so important to

00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,740
like think about what you're getting

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,790
into and make sure the decision you make

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,800
is very informed this is again exactly

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,480
what happened in catalyst by the way he

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,339
signed up to a project and it was

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,230
repurposed for other things he would not

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:05,659
have signed up if he had known what they

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:07,039
would use it for this is another

00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:11,270
real-life example I think this one is

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,059
really interesting so learnin is an

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,799
open-source software management program

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,480
and last year they implemented a change

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,980
in their license that would prevent it

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,230
from being used by companies that have

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,829
contracted with ice because of like the

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,630
allegations of human rights abuse and so

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,630
they put this out they listed several

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,270
high-profile companies specifically and

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,690
it caused huge divisive 'no sin the

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:38,179
community someone wrote this quote that

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,770
i don't agree with the Lerner projects

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,179
choice is destructive of one of the deep

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,190
norms that keeps the open source

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,760
community functional keeping politics

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,669
separated from our work um the decision

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,220
end up being reversed a day later this

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,480
happened only for one day I don't really

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,240
think it's helpful to debate the

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,090
validity of this particular decision

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,770
I do think it's interesting to see like

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,320
folks that were thinking about this and

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,510
what the reaction was like I find this

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,210
idea of keeping politics separated from

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,370
work very scary because it's not

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,860
actually possible politics are always

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,600
intertwined with our work I think we can

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,730
either acknowledge that and accept it

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,800
and be smart about it or like live in

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,490
denial and then be unable to implement

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,110
accountability this is the problem that

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,120
I think arises when you think of your

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,179
work as secular for morality as I

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,590
mentioned earlier malevolence versus

00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,900
carelessness I really love this quote

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,750
any sufficiently advanced neglect is

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,240
indistinguishable from malice I think

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,190
that's really true if you create a city

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,500
out of straw you don't need an army of

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,030
people to come down and destroy it one

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,300
person can just burn the whole thing

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,040
down InfoSec happens to like work in a

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,830
similar way if you create a system

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,510
that's compromisable it's like building

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,910
a city out of straw you don't need a

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,830
whole army of people just one person can

00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:00,130
exploit it and then it's too late

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,080
like it's already been exploited and I

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,390
think interest in the organization's as

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,920
a whole can be like this too we've

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,059
talked a lot about thinking about

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,559
morality or ethics if 99 people at your

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:15,070
company just like aren't thinking about

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,290
ethics then one person a person like or

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,490
synchronic could come in and convince

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,020
them to build something that's unethical

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,940
and they might go along with that

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:26,190
because they haven't placed

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,190
accountability in their system

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,420
algorithmic bias is a huge problem I

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,880
could do a whole talk on this but I only

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,530
have time to do one slide on it but it's

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,450
a problem that's caused more by

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,559
carelessness than the malevolence or at

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,270
least that's what I'd like to believe

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,800
hopefully what do I mean here sometimes

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,570
I'm talking about like features that you

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,250
think might be like cute or convenient

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,490
for the majority of your users but they

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,470
could be like hurtful in edge cases the

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,270
this first example is someone there's

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,640
like a algorithm at Facebook that shows

00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,170
like your most loved photo from the year

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,630
and it puts a little cute animations

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,010
over it but this person's most loved

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,570
photo was like when their mom died

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,250
because lots of people supported them

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,870
and they showed like the cute animations

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,090
over it and it was like hurtful

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,070
this other example is from Twitter this

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,580
is like Twitter doesn't ask you for your

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,380
gender but then it just like decides

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,910
what gender it thinks you are based on

00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,860
your posts and like puts it on your

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,510
account which I'm sure they thought like

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,300
oh we don't have to ask people like we

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,830
can just guess but like that's really

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,630
hurtful particularly in the trans

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,490
community people who are already used to

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,810
like being misgendered like seeing that

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,170
they're being misgendered further by

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:39,560
this algorithm but sometimes it can be

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,540
more serious than that to take the

00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,430
compas algorithm for example

00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,980
it measures predicted recidivism for

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:48,100
folks convicted of crimes so like how

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,320
likely they are to commit crimes again

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,060
only about 60% of the people who are

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,760
predicted by this algorithm actually go

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,580
on to commit future crimes so it's not

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,470
that accurate and also black defendants

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,660
are twice as likely to be false flagged

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,910
as high-risk and white defendants are

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:08,030
twice as likely to be false flags as

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,760
low-risk that's from an investigation by

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,320
Pro Publica and that's partially because

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,820
of the questions that are asked things

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,090
like has anyone in your family or

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,380
neighborhood have been arrested since we

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,060
have like black people getting

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,000
incarcerated at six times the rate of

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,560
white people because of racial profiling

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,120
it's more like they're more likely to be

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,340
considered at risk even if they've never

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,970
had any trouble with the law before him

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:36,170
and this algorithm which by the way is

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,090
secret because its proprietary actually

00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,340
affects what kind of sentencing of

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,670
people will get in court which is crazy

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:47,360
to me that's so bad and it's got this

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:48,890
like bias built into it again I could

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,810
talk about this forever these are two

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,190
books that I've read on this topic that

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,650
I really recommend I will post these

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:59,350
afterwards so we've been talking a lot

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,250
about people who like lack of moral code

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,140
hopefully we've established that that's

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,100
not you you know you want to do good you

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,450
care about the people that your

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,400
algorithms could affect but what if like

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,870
it's your boss that's kind of what I

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,490
mean by like you have to know who the

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,740
general is it could be a scary

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,300
realization if you realize that you're

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,780
like instructions are coming from

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,980
someone who's not acting in good faith

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,659
so again I turn first hour

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,909
to start with for answers because

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,470
there's no more morally corrupt employer

00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:30,710
than the Empire and they employed so

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,820
many people so if you find yourself in

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,649
one of those situations there's

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,149
different things you can do you know you

00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:37,070
can sell out you can quit

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:42,380
we know how Galen or so dealt with his

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:44,360
guilt but we're not always talking about

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,740
obvious sabotage in that way I have

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,419
another story from Star Wars that I

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,000
think is really interesting this is from

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,769
the cartoon Star Wars rebels and then

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,370
this is agent Kallus he worked for the

00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:58,039
Empire he's he wasn't like Galen or so

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,299
he was like an imperial poster boy he

00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,000
like rose up through the ranks of the

00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,419
empire like the normal way but he had

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,429
this really interesting Redemption arc

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,809
because like he this is ever Elias he

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,330
was stranded they were strict he's one

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,710
of the rebels from rebels and they were

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,539
stranded together they had to work

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,130
together to survive they began to

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,330
respect each other that's like a story

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,500
you've heard I'm actually not crazy

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,480
about that kind of story normally I

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,740
think it puts a lot of pressure on like

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,750
marginalized people to find common

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,159
ground with oppressors

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,330
that's orient for a different day but

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,750
this one I actually thought was really

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,919
good and interesting because that was

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,139
just like I don't have anything to prove

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,690
to you you know I'm confident my

00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:38,000
decisions he kept his cool like but not

00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,679
because he owed it to him and that

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,169
planted the seeds of doubt and callus

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,659
about what the Empire was doing and at

00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,340
the end of the episode Zeb has a tearful

00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:48,110
reunion with his friends they come to

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,850
save him it's very emotional and

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,070
callused has to find his way back to the

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,250
Empire alone nobody like noticed or

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,779
cared that he was gone it at all

00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,669
so obviously something got through to

00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,620
him because he ended up defecting and

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:03,399
then feeding imperial secrets to the

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,649
rebels as like secret agent fulcrum

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:08,630
which i think is really interesting

00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:14,840
because it's like really about where you

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:16,309
can do the most good you could quit an

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,450
argument I see it against quitting it's

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:19,309
like well it doesn't matter they'll just

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,309
replace you like if someone's gonna do

00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,679
it might as well be you I guess I

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,299
disagree with that um maybe if you're

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,980
specialised enough it might be hard to

00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,710
replace you that's what happened with

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,900
Galen or so they had to pull him back in

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,730
to finish the project

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,230
but even if you're not irreplaceable

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,289
your efforts can be better used

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,669
elsewhere wedge antilles is another

00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:44,220
person who worked for the empire he was

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:46,830
a pilot he quit his absence didn't hurt

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,390
the Empire they had other pilots but

00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:52,190
then he became a reply --let for the

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:52,190
rebellion instead and that did hurt them

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,030
rebellion from the inside isn't always

00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:59,280
death star level sabotage I'm not here

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,780
to go in to tell you to go into work and

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,510
like literally blow up whatever you're

00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,220
working on if it's a literal planet

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,860
destroyer maybe a good idea but

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,659
otherwise there's different kinds of

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,880
things we're talking about maybe from

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,409
the inside you can convince your your

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,020
company or your organization to change

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:20,039
their practices not everything isn't as

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,390
unambiguous as the Empire may be in one

00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,850
of those neglected versus male

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,350
situations you might be able to bring

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,210
these things up and persuade people

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,750
around you to like think about it and do

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,490
better and whistleblowing is important

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,070
to that's essentially what Callas did

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,110
his agent fulcrum he was feeding the

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:42,419
good guys information about like what

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:45,630
the Empire was doing fighting the good

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:48,150
fight can be overwhelming here if you

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:50,429
can't beat them join them a lot and I

00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:53,940
get that like when people are scared it

00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:55,590
feels easier to do things that you don't

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,510
feel comfortable with because there's

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,690
pressure it could affect you we talked

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:03,630
in the open space today about what was

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,840
the phrase someone shouted out from the

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:09,409
burn out open space alright no one was

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,409
there sorry

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,520
about like harm reduction unlike harm

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,330
verse to others versus harm for yourself

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,400
so I get that there's something

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,080
attractive about getting in with people

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,760
that might oppress you then like someone

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:28,790
else is in the line of fire and you are

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,290
safe moral injury yes thank you this is

00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,850
especially true for marginalized people

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,070
that we there's a huge pressure to be

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,620
like one of the good ones it's really

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,910
stressful actually and I know that like

00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,040
real life could be messier than this

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,950
like particularly in cases of

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,330
underrepresented people like sometimes

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,520
it's like a known safety thing I'm

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,040
definitely not here to guilt-trip

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,330
underrepresented groups into like

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,390
putting their job if they don't have

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,070
that luxury definitely not but it is

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,400
something to consider if you are in a

00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:01,280
situation we do kind of have that luxury

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,919
that an unethical organization like the

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,020
Empire only cares about you for as long

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,000
as you're useful not only is it

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,490
unethical to position yourself to

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,860
oppress others to save yourself but it

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,890
also doesn't make them suddenly care

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,929
about you as a person this is really

00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,970
well explored in Star Wars media like

00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,580
the Gulf of what it's like to be part of

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,840
the rebellion versus the Empire rebels

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,370
is still a great example it's really

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,590
about a family and people who care

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,809
deeply about each other and time after

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,820
time I can't help but marvel over how

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:33,710
awful it sounds to be part of the Empire

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,200
nobody seems to have meaningful

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,720
relationships with each other everyone

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,160
is rooting for everyone else to fail so

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,200
they can seize power it's hyper

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,730
competitive all the time if you get

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,530
higher ranking they still don't care

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:50,059
about you in fact then more people want

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:51,740
you to fail orsten chronic is a really

00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,200
prime example of this I'm coming back to

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,190
him at the end because like it really it

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,950
really got to me

00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,900
senior hook one I related to chronic in

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,809
a lot of ways he was an ambitious person

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,710
he loved networking and he was good at

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:09,830
it he made connections between people I

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,330
pride myself on these things too and so

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,760
I see a lot of myself in chronic and

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,960
it's scary when you see yourself in the

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,410
villain but I think it's really

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,090
important to be able to admit that

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,680
because it shows you what things about

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,050
your own life you need to be careful

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,550
about

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,000
whoreson kind of worked so hard to gain

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,950
favor within the empire his whole life

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,130
he even succeeded at building them a

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,600
Death Star but then after he gave it to

00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,440
them they just took what he had built

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,970
and let him be destroyed he spent his

00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,340
whole life being the villain and why did

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,150
he have to show for it at the end

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:48,400
absolutely nothing so that's my

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,660
conclusion sorry if this is

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,470
disappointing but I don't have all the

00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,720
answers

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,070
there's not really a single line that I

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,560
can point out and say this is the line

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,850
no inch across we all have to decide

00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,180
what's important to us and where our

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,880
personal line is but I can add you to

00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,310
make a conscious decision about that

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,780
think about it thoughtfully and commit

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,450
to stinking sticking to your own

00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,760
principles on it my hope is that if we

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,100
can all do that we won't end up building

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,390
another Death Star thank you for

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,170
listening and thank you for letting me

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,170
talk about ethics

00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:27,870
that's better thank you so great talk so

00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,270
my sort of struggle is you come up with

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,750
something facial-recognition whatever

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:36,570
right they're all dual edged swords that

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,670
could do good or bad and like part of my

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,900
head is okay well if I don't build it

00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:46,910
someone else will

00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,910
right and then so what can you do to

00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:53,280
prepare the world if you will for this

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:58,290
new technology that's coming that's a

00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:03,390
great question I think that's a big

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:05,610
question I think that like talking about

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,700
it is really important the one that I'm

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,850
particularly scared about is deep fakes

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,980
I think deep fakes are terrifying like

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,600
people can make these videos that like

00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,980
look like you and they're talking and

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,620
look people can't tell the difference I

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,170
think it's super scary but like I want

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,060
everyone to know about deep fakes like I

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,320
want it to be as common as the thing is

00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,510
when you see a picture and be like oh

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,460
are you sure like is that photoshopped

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:33,110
like I want to put that kind of doubt in

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,430
people's minds and I think that like

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,650
talking about it to everyone you meet is

00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,010
like how I try to do it like I'm you

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,600
know come up on stage and talk about it

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:46,740
but I think that like an informed public

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,510
is just gonna be better prepared for

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,300
this kind of stuff I agree with you that

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,560
it's like it's coming no matter what you

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,880
know I don't want to be the person who

00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,020
can't sleep at night because like I

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,990
built some of this stuff but you're

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,460
right like it's gonna be in our society

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm gonna think more about that because

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,750
it's a really big question but my answer

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,610
for now is just like talk about it

00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:12,450
openly with everybody that you can so

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:14,460
everyone is like as aware as possible so

00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,300
I'll give you two two quick thoughts on

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,940
that as well

00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,640
one it sorry yeah but we have time to

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,260
kill so what is Mary Lou Jepsen who is

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,390
doing something even more scary than

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,760
deep facing with open water I oh and

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,530
she's actually going out and talking

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,380
amongst the community of researchers and

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,240
saying how are we going to deal with

00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,780
ethical problems what governance can be

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,180
put in place but it is hard so good luck

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,810
yeah you have any thoughts on how to

00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:44,950
screen at the interviewing process for

00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:47,000
unethical behavior because nobody says

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,380
yeah we're doing in this unethical

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,200
project over here it's gonna be great

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,850
they all tell you oh no this is it's

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,610
completely innocent thing and then you

00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,150
have to discover way too late that this

00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:01,640
is terrible yes the question was how do

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,610
you screen at the interview stage for

00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,830
things like this and I think that that's

00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,480
tough I think that in some cases it's

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,370
not really possible unfortunately like

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,770
we could also talk for a whole hour

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,230
about like the interviewing process in

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,390
our industry and how it's kind of flawed

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,650
in a lot of ways but this question is

00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,660
interesting because actually someone

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,030
asked me this recently my dad asked me

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:27,020
this recently because he's interviewing

00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:28,070
and he had like a job that he was

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,780
interviewing for and he's like what

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,550
questions would you ask in the interview

00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,710
to get at these things he was worried

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,290
about like um military drone kind of

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,050
things and I was like I would ask the

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,990
company for like a list of their 10

00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,430
biggest clients I think that's like a

00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:48,200
really reasonable thing to want to know

00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:50,630
and like information about like what's

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,180
what who they're supplying to you like

00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,370
what's military what's not you know I

00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,680
just it's good information and like it's

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,850
not that you have this is kind of the

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,050
whole point of my talk is that like it's

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,850
not that you have to make a certain

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,440
decision but like having as much

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,800
information as possible and like teasing

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,150
that out I think like there are some

00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,290
ways you can do that but I agree with

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,760
you if you're as some other that's like

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,800
totally unethical like if they lie to

00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,130
you then you know you're just screwed

00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,140
and it sucks so I feel that interviewing

00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,820
is really hard I'm not working and I'm

00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,820
gonna have to do it someone recruit me

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,710

00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:30,029
any other questions we have about three

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,659
minutes so if you have one more

00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:35,350

00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,860
all right thank you Jamison

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:52,170

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:52,170
