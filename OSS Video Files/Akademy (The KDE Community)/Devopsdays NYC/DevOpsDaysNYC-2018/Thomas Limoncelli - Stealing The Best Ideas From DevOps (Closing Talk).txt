Title: Thomas Limoncelli - Stealing The Best Ideas From DevOps (Closing Talk)
Publication date: 2018-02-01
Playlist: DevOpsDaysNYC-2018
Description: 
	DevOps talks tend to emphasize SLDC and CI/CD situations. In this talk I teach 5 of the most important DevOps principles (Small Batches, MVP, and The Three Ways of DevOps) by applying those principles outside of the usual web application environment. Case studies improving a new-hire onboarding process, improving a website failover process, deploying a monitoring system, building a PXE-install system, and writing a book. By the end of this talk youâ€™ll have a better understanding of the principles of DevOps in a way that helps you apply them at home and at work.
