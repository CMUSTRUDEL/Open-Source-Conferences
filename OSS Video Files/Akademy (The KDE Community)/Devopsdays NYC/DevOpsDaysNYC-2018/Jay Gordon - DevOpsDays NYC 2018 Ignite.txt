00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,000
so my name is Jay and I was assistant

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,680
administrator for a long time that's my

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,800
buddy Rico he's gonna be along for the

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,019
trip and I was gonna call over around 10

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
years which was a long time to be on

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,890
call and it was not at my home

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
it was just one of those things that

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,880
happened and you know I dealt with

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,670
burnout because global via DevOps days

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,170
without discussing Bernie Eddie now so

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,680
he dumped a burnout it was time to kind

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,329
of start looking at a new career so I

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,280
made some decisions

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,649
and then I started to realize the career

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,680
change is scary as hell because let's

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:58,410
face it you do one thing for a long time

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,690
the prospect of not doing it anymore can

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,399
be frightening so what did I do

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,930
I started to look into try to move in a

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,479
new direction then I started to think to

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,930
myself what do I want to do I thought

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,760
about what I loved and when I was great

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:24,509
job and then I say I just need a new

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:26,549
role was there rolling solutions

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,159
architecture is an engineering it's a

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,049
great job but it wasn't for me I just

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,750
didn't really want to tie into numbers

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,930
and then there's support I got my career

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,610
started in support helping people just

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,159
started realizing that okay I like

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,560
people I want to stay focused on humans

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,479
because humans are easier to figure out

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,000
sometimes in software software can

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,829
really be bad so I started to think all

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
right so what's the next step we're

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,329
going to walk where will it go

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,700
what wouldn't I be because it's still

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,869
move you when I grow up I still don't

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,479
know what I wanna be when I grow up and

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm almost 40 so it's taken me some time

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,610
but then I started watching these really

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,460
amazing people I started know a lot more

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,979
events and I started

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,980
hearing them influence me on using

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,140
technologies that help build up to what

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,350
a kind of career I happened so started

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,590
listening to them and started making

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,300
decision

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,250
developer advocacy was the role I wanted

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,800
to go to I have to start working with

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,050
peers more often I got to create content

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,209
to help them learn and then I actually

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,280
got them to help me but they created

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,190
content on your behalf and I got to tell

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,319
the story and I've got to become a

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,560
raccoon I got to be messy

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,350
I got to build things and get printed in

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,239
the muck and find out how to build

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,820
things quicker easier faster and more

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,910
fun without actually being tied to

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:53,500
deploys and I used the skills that I

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,120
kind of had as a vegan Hobson's system

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,459
and miniature administration to help

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,769
kind of lend to the things that I wanted

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,019
to start doing because no matter what

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,760
these are great skills to have but then

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,830
I started doing other things that

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,840
actually were moving my career in a

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,819
completely different direction and I

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,190
started learning the value of community

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,930
building and working within communities

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,280
even more beyond just the volunteering

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:21,900
that I was - and here comes the analogy

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,250
so I started to recognize that

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,630
developing communities reminded me a lot

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,670
of the people that were watching this

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,310
cartoon that was only on for a little

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:35,410
bit on a network that only existed

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,260
almost half today in Adult Swim and I

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,390
watched their fandom of this began

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,820
advocacy and then when I say to get

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,579
advocacy I started noticing that people

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,940
were just going wild for this cartoon to

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:51,489
the point where there was a sauce that

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,340
became a plotline in an episode and

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,970
because of this it actually made an

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,650
entire group of people leave their homes

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,660
to be able to be part of an experience

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,990
that they felt was important to them so

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,420
what

00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,940
do the Nerds left they went out they

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,270
stood aligned on cars and they said I

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,000
want the sauce get me the sauce because

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,710
there were fans and those fans became

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,380
advocates they came to the street and it

00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,390
reminded me a lot about DevOps it

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,280
reminded me about how if you create

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,170
spaces for people where they feel that

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,110
they're their fandom can be turned into

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,200
something more then you create these

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,000
incredible experiences and environments

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,570
and it just really kind of started

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,670
reminded me of the tech conferences so

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,310
maybe we all come to places like DevOps

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,380
days because they're facilitating things

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,000
the way kind of McDonald's do now

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,130
McDonald's is distract corporation blah

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,680
blah blah evil whatever but the fact

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,320
this is that they've created a place for

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
me to give solves to people in these

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,900
conferences where I can give them tools

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,100
introduce people and get them skilled up

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,580
at how to actually start building

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,230
software or building systems and this is

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,990
the thing that just became a

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,960
life-changing moment for him so that's

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,370
my move into developer advocacy and I

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,230
hope you consider it because it's been a

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,390
really great career move and we need

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,310
more developer advocates to go ahead

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,650
into the world and promote great work

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,420
and DevOps methodologies thank you very

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,420
much for your time love you all

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,509
