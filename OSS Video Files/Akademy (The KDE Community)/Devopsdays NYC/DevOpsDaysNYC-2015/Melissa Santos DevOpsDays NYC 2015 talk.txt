I am super excited to introduce our next

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,160
speaker she is here visiting us from

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,620
Portland she has an impressive

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,809
collection of us three master's degrees

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,279
in PhD but she uses few things like

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:21,109
create amazing reaction gifts she's also

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:25,699
one of the organizers on big day in pdx

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,699
I'm going to welcome Melissa Santa's

00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,130
thanks everyone it's pretty exciting to

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,570
be here this is working can you hear me

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,219
it's not working all magic work is

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,219
usually a month on the top

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:51,020
ah he's tricking can you hear me yeah

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,910
awesome cool slam talk about from the

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,559
DevOps Lance Buffy which all the people

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,590
who are used to dev ops or probably

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,690
lived well duh but i also have talked

00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,400
about my backgrounds not into options of

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,670
interesting come into this realization

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,619
of a las colinas moscow it has a team in

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,390
that ground introduce you to my terrible

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,490
sense of humor so it's all so fuzzy in

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:16,700
our case because our teams covered pet

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:18,500
hair so definitely puzzle disconnect so

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,990
my background is in data is totally a

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,970
dinner event attack since 2001 but I

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,280
always gravitated the 10 for the data

00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,580
end of the team HCL's have done the

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,930
dashboards things like that I've had two

00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,970
things in production but they're usually

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,420
not things that had a lot of end users

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,430
that have lots of moving pieces I put

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:43,160
myself through grad school and data

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:45,740
stuff why working at IBM and starters so

00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,289
back in two thousand and one was pre

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,340
DevOps it smoothly devops wisla started

00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:54,950
in 2010 2007 which was a new thing but

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,660
when i started crops would still like up

00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,940
here we were like you're gonna forget

00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,190
you gotta do upsets me like my ancestor

00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,459
machines you're the tail end of that

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,170
bastard operator compelling things were

00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,599
horrible rocks and so they made sure

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,380
that they were responsive and I get that

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,090
swine I didn't just think about this

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,650
presentation I was talking about this

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,440
the other day on Twitter so I was in a

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,730
room with both operations people i'm

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,980
usually setting out to as much as

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,990
possible and data centers technicians

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,790
who it turns out now that i had their

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,930
clothes from your power button Darren

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,900
people are a little hard to make sure

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,580
we're happy that both illuminating and

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,209
one of people who have my hardware

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,120
people on my team happy I think that so

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:40,459
that does come from like this old school

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,989
we're really up before that when

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,740
officers people that you had to aquis

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,940
and so on

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,100
yes so I have this game debut I had to

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,200
start them for a little while and I have

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,360
something that this is no Sarah and like

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,250
the author we started having what we

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,080
have a rockstar well for them too much

00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,540
but the heroes you ran in and put out

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,450
fires we aren't looking for ninja dads

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,550
and crap like that that's just through

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,950
rise to the tub so this weird star up

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:11,290
there like you need to scale we're gonna

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,940
get acquired yeah buddy ops for that

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,050
post native essences it as a gift

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,970
Amazon's minus five so I'm really happy

00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,220
that I've lent the net see where we had

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,900
Upton's a lot more balanced I'm very

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,130
particularly wanted to see top of this

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,720
because how precariously imbalanced if I

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,400
wanted to emphasize that it's balanced

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,710
but didn't want it that the slightest

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,620
notion changes the balance and it

00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,570
changes all the time so that's why I

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,030
mean by the design is fuzzy but it's a

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:45,040
continual working together to figure out

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,040
what you need to be doing on the stuff

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,340
so how did I end up in weird data

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,570
background I haven't googled of

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,180
upstanding you're dying to you about

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,220
those days flat September I became a

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,800
management for the first 15 managed to

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,010
date a flat martini and shorthand

00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,590
acidity of jpg as well they're so soft

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:09,110
they do a lot of stuff we have a lot

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,340
where a lot of partner and I can do I

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,680
event or something i thought i've

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,390
managed do scientists or analysts or

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,920
something like that but i heard what

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,870
these guys i was one of their name user

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,250
as I knew also they didn't I appreciate

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,810
them so when they were looking for a

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,510
manager it was really nice to be able to

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,830
go wow yeah I can help them out and who

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,260
get them the support they deserve

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:31,820
attention they deserve and then I got to

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,380
learn a boner that's what it did so

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,240
there there's much more to our

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,160
calculator I'll draw how much what you

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,110
want but data engineering sits with an

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,200
infrastructure the other platforms this

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,840
was in data engineering data acts often

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,330
sits between data engineering analyst so

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,820
we're like the closest edge of data to

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,830
box we have no slow hardware cause most

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,060
of the problems things like that

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,760
and we don't usually interacts Petros

00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:02,730
it'd be a less and less only this data

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:05,460
that i can get to do help we're closed

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,190
ops as far as my end users are concerned

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,780
I responsible applause trivia I manage

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,180
the team finished possible clustering

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,750
that they don't care what the center is

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,130
down on our rasgon what they just need

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,890
to know they want a cluster they with

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,420
their data and that's my problem how we

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,250
told to get there with them so if you

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,650
have to Britain's like ordering hard

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,540
errands then setting things up and hey

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,570
that did my bad please can someone fix

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,550
it it's a lot of time we do have

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,890
problems that solve them are just like

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,070
burger issues or permissions is used for

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,050
somebody changed a d/s setting or

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,280
whatever so there's a lot of overlap

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,110
needs were together anything's fixed

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,669
this might feel like a chantment but I'm

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,620
going to go on and on about how much

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:52,350
nything teams are important and how much

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,280
i love the way lets you set up two teams

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,440
so this is from betsy seven they sent to

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,120
our engineering work and one of the

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,150
things is also etsy is that we are

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,070
completely aligned with our solvers

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,830
honey we make money it's really nice to

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,660
have the finances that clearly linked up

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,460
and so some extent where six sort of

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,210
something people are over 200 something

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,140
engineering group but we're also

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,900
supporting a million small businesses

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,520
around the world so we're emitting a

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,250
request for your company let me look up

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,560
the team because we are one team with

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,240
all these e news everywhere and I like

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,740
to try to keep everybody focused on that

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,229
even though is we're deep in

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,580
infrastructure read the users do not see

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:36,810
my team thankfully but and then the

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,690
demins we also still to work together

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,940
within etsy to do this way we're all at

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:46,979
seeing goal on the big scale let's all

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,690
go on small scale so we get there so ice

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,100
plant a sleep-deprived fillet a couple

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,870
of weeks ago thinking about what i

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,510
really meant matatini that won't matter

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,580
to me a team I want to make this ting

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,620
chen done team is together for a short

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,330
period of time relatively this is not

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,340
family is not forever

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,139
you're together while share a mounting

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,580
costs while you have a goal to do

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,860
together and that goal much is your

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,680
personal goals cool we're a team and

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,469
you're going forward together two

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,150
athletes will win I have to get

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,300
cooperative board games so this move do

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,979
you live or geography so it is worth my

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,840
while is actually very much the wrong

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,360
network this is like an RPG metaphor

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,620
winning at teens is about leveling up

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,659
all your individuals it's about

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,000
completing quests it's about getting

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:32,949
things done and feeling that sense of

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,400
accomplishment I know I think help each

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:40,539
other get there I want to emphasize but

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,389
we're not aggregation we're more complex

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:45,099
than that we get people people there

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,169
Stephanie mix of skills and strips and

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,520
you need to acknowledge that by each

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,590
other and learn about that from each

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,000
other so that you can actually make sure

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:56,020
you don't have to use the right things

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,370
from each other and trust is really

00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,199
important part keynes i want to

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:03,759
emphasize that it's really hard to get

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:06,370
and it's slow down i think the people

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,800
connections are really the most

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,020
important you need to understand each

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,639
other and what you want and you won't

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,460
know if your goals in line unless you've

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,449
been able to talk about your goals

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,419
hopefully you all want to get the

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,569
customs we did it providence on but at

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,409
some point maybe you want to know Oh

00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,479
stones don't want to learn more about

00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,860
this as we know on this project doing so

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,560
until wants to do some more men trying

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,819
to make sure your feet there's what

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,349
crime knowing each other and knowing

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,949
where you want to go you can help each

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,949
other get there

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,290
Trust is so important just is still

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,450
important teens we can't get it fast the

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,150
only advice I have for skiing at trust

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,310
product process is to get your feedback

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,710
loop as tight as possible you people

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,000
offers communities to see to standing

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,670
there going to you and to show the

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,370
theater and that that is going to happen

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,870
over time feeling you can do is increase

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,750
the opportunities and get them closer

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,880
together to time but without decent

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,620
sized things it's just weird new time so

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,120
some extent i'm saying you're not ever

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,300

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,990

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:31,930
invest oh okay cause the end of my rant

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:34,030
about teams this is a team of d / one

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,950
more of a big emphasis on humanity and

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,050
individuality doesn't matter what these

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,730
people of death or ops their whole large

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,220

go away a few Hannibal things that use

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,310
to get better and we're working with

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,500

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,030
these techniques would equilibrium

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,420
they're all guests on really big melons

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,310
group so you should ask people what to

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,460
do for you and how much time and effort

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,110

you can you're learning their goals and

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:02,040
you're helping them achieve them at the

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,690
same time similarly you cannot remember

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,180
you do not that was going on my brain

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,860
all the time so I'm glad and tell you

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,650

cluster next week in sourcing you said I

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:27,820
could so excited so you need to share

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,200

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,090
what's coming up with you so that people

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,950
see it coming if you do I was not as

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,050
excited about it perhaps my ops team

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,400
would about putting a lot of sizzle and

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,620
making sure that it got racked very

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,830
goodly and these were going it's quickly

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,830
but since I've been very clear for

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:52,960
several months I'm sorry I think we're

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:55,060
gonna get that going I think open door I

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,310
think that as its Ian you want to be

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,960
inviting and maybe as an individual and

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,520
I workroom goes to meetings his part of

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,590
this he was just being able to say hey

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,110
I'm here to talk and here for you I want

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,030
to be part of things with you so I'm one

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,950
of my team asked if he could buy candy

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,480
to keep in our group in office near his

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,840
area as if people come and ask them

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,430
questions I was like yes and if the

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,750
company does expensive per year it

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,870
rejects the expense they have a cable

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,610
it's totally fun yes it would be then

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,220
you want to do something active to make

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,680
tea me inviting is like exactly the sort

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,390
of thing and open warrior just including

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,790
people letting people know girl mouth

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,770
you part of your team that you're not

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,450
not putting up those individual walls

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,930
saying we're just appreciated we don't

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,930
talk to you

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,200
it's a fun like you to work with always

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,020
looking dal they help when you work with

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,910
them it's still pool but you should tell

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,620
them and they tell their managers I'm

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,380
like make sure that your master knows

00:12:51,620 --> 00:13:02,810
the person intentional stuff just get

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:04,730
the word out he takes great stuff and

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,890
i'm not sure like this will be accurate

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,480
that mean blabbering but what I mean by

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,520
collaborating you will sit in the same

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,290
room and talk about your needs and be

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,760
able to figure out the trade-offs it's

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:19,490
really sad to be like this is what I

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,410
want only muster up now you have so we

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,930
have to talk about what it is the best

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,520
trade-off for me what I thought versus

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,740
the people of other people about aids

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,440
and what else is going on normal being

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,760
able to gotta go oh that person whom

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,920
I've heard of people would leave this

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:40,820
instead being able to actually had to be

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:44,210
a dialogue with a big difference here

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,210
are some get a black Michael already so

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,670
house to adopt my team so my team is me

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,920
in Portland and headed for developers

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,130
one us cattle one Minneapolis and to

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,170
everyone and until it was slide I've not

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,120
realize quite how hard my ops team was

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,520
embarrassing rest of my team I want

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,030
priorities and adopts a secondary isn't

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,310
even us and three advisory house I I've

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,520
been getting this is cool if you want /

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:13,130
done as a lot of adriaen so designated

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,080
obstacles solely with my team the

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,730
Eternity have lots of other teams

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,460
they're open them as well don't even

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,900
know how many probably should but for

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,980
the first person I would talk to you at

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,990
the first person someone else involved

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,560
with talk to you about something amazing

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,420
most likely contact with that so there's

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,190
they're kind of like as we go down there

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,170
further away from my team and let's let

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,170
me be included in everything activities

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,700
so when I took on this team back in

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,410
September they work they're doing

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,589
pessimist that some things were going

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,110
better but Polly firefighters like data

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:56,010
janitors people are four doses what they

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,770
do please this meeting to the space

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,830
beckville understand cascading node

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,750
failure I think that I heard a lot of

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,750
was we wish we could do lesson ops work

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:11,490
and think that we had to figure out how

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:14,520
to tackle up and yeah nothing's are so

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,950
much better at all we're exploring data

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,260
technologies we're looking ahead we're

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,850
teaching people we do a monthly session

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,920
where we invite people to come learn

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,290
house or stock image of infrastructure

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,000
things earlier and indeed out we start

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,529
doing learning sessions on fridays

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,930
they're trying to do better and we

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:33,000
should wet too so we're just figuring

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,560
out how we can expand knowledge what we

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,050
do and help out and be a lot more

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,790
proactive cuisine and instead of feeling

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,950
like pops words just a thing that we're

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,930
stuck with usually it's something that

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,490
we are hard to do we are able to do

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,520
something but it's something we're not

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,740
we can work with ops to get it done we

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,140
have a dialogue figure out you should do

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,820
it or what makes sense who's busy right

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:58,620
now it's fun it's fun to hear cops it's

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,060
way better than just not top of you sad

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,790
they don't do things that you didn't

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:07,860
tell them you want to uh so i have to my

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,630
desiccated ops aside you're officially

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,100
forgot I belleza not to work I want to

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,660
do this privately they didn't want to

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,520
like get a teen to go someone what I

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,050
said what do you want to learn more

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,209
about you do you want two more on your

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,470
stuff how much time do you have for me

00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,329
do you have other teams in other

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,899
projects how much time you have what's

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:26,550
know kind of typical ah I asked what do

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,220
you like to do what would be better for

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,959
you for working with us will be so just

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,290
finding out what Kurt passing you once

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,790
gave us a lot more ability in 200 now

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,310
that I know we're dressing is I can like

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,020
volunteers making it a oh you can work

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,700
with our ops person I just told them

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,990
that before finding out the chief of

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,990
time I have to do that

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:53,399
she seems me okay yes the mirrorless

00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,859
reminds me is totally open anyone that

00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,239
sees it there's a east one personal

00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:59,759
mailing list who is never worked closely

00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:01,889
with my team and gets all my house

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,360
that's why he was going out my TV's

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:09,419
lagrima I'm good no what's going on

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,699
you're interested great one of the

00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,339
things we did Monday's meeting we've

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,889
always going to enlist as we go around

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,980
this week after a while I realized we

00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:21,029
can make it more efficient and more

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,399
likely that cover all the things we

00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:25,110
wanted to we had an agenda as well as

00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:28,409
doing to go round we want to go what

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,750
else we're getting from this and we

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,639
wouldn't put it in a Google Doc and made

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,440
it every way everyone and you hope

00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:36,840
everyone which means that if you're

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,850
saying one of my advisory ups you can

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,710
look at the agenda and decide what do

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,710

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:47,090
talking about order your practices it's

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,220
cool down in there you mustard letting

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,080
the by making it an open thing at any

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,610
one cabinet so you could also be one of

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,259
those people do it they really need to

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,559
think about the never use every cluster

00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,570
put that marriage intention to meeting

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:04,710
it's something that like we're worried

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,909
about you know to contribute to it of

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,740
course I'd when I want involvement

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,600
reports but I also who went home with ms

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,250
and get it off every two weeks we have

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,230
half an hour and talk about what's going

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,509
on what's going to fight what I'm right

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,070

what's going on an eagle over together

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,820
on it and she kind of had that time to

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,820
be really honest to go over scared on

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:33,110
also if you come to my status meetings

00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:37,049

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:40,230
up I invite that hole open my own list

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,179

management of my interns if that they

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,980

00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,440
ways of making sure that I'm giving

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,850

didn't get you every rebels and talk

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,360
about how usually posted a couple of

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,850
instances on how we've collaborated

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,390
effectively ah Thank You Buster which

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:24,520
you never so exciting that's above a lot

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:27,910
of collaboration not talking about I

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,380
know what we're doing writing now what

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,720
our performance problems are and there

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,040
were ready to bounce I don't know what

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,140
the current hardeners gonna do to fix

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,000
that so I throw a lobster live with

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,040
seems from what can you do within our

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,230
budget to handle a fact that we're

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,309
maxing out on grand ol time cool let's

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,140
do these things and we're also moving d

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,510
descent

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,610
so I had a blue metal customer there's a

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,370
lot had some very interesting talks

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,110
about that I thought the first meeting a

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,630
client unless and we're know anything

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,760
about this but we've got like 3 30

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,170
minute conversation is about timing and

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
how it should work out and we've had

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:07,050
some surprises when you ask people what

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,670
could be a pain point for you Bob said

00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,760
from manager speak I think I actually

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:15,810
said you how stabbed that thank you got

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,520
stabbed use emoji to rage face every was

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,250
very surprised they were not more angry

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,390
than that so it was we were able to face

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,160
the plan around through that they

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,960
thought they did the data center people

00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,730
would really unhappy about the onions on

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,490
that actually but would have never

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,080
didn't ask and that was a little joy of

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,600
honey meeting is we had that opportunity

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,730
really wait is that how hard is that

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,680
constraint really you know it's not the

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,510
best thing but which of these are the

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,700
worst which constraints can you move

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:50,310
without heart hurts worse than the

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:53,670
others we had a multi multi successful

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,550
collaboration where we fought a lap

00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:03,210
greenhorn and it's willed us error

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:05,490
success yeah I really appreciate that by

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,590
collaborating kofsky entire time it

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,560
wasn't really because we did it as a

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:15,260
collaboration I know that we saw all we

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,260
had the ops point of you ain't doing Oh

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,060
we'd be off with you and he had the dev

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,620
point of view and so I know that we

00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,660
covered all this basis we didn't want to

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,090
time I feel irritated longer to exhaust

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,660
the possibilities what we were ever able

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,660
to do

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,760
see represent the rocks right this is a

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,500
rosemary shoofly pie that mean for us

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,260

dev ops plan I've learned imagine least

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,990
seven months this is like what I have

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,480

to talk to me but i would love to gather

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,710

two of our regular office hugs yeah we

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,690
got office bugs you're good can you talk

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,720
a little bit about the fact that you're

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,070
in portland a lot of NC is distributed

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,260
but a lot of it's also in brooklyn and

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,180
what it's like managing people that you

00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,820
aren't seeing in person all the time so

00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,400
the problem is that our energy vultures

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,520
oh yeah talking about me or my manager

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,350
how it's different windows in Berlin

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:13,130
I've never been a manager a person but I

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:14,780
together good how do you make sure you

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,660
stay in touch with your team members so

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,360
we have our one-on-ones agreed stay we

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,710
stay in touch by our long when I ones

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,690
everything we don't always take the full

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,220
hour but I think I one of my first goals

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,650
was making sure they knew that that was

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,200
my job I am available to them I have

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,850
time for them any of the deep in

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,430
something or I'll blow off something

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,470
that want me to be the first mates we

00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,670
meet up really really trying to the

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,920
person it doesn't always work out

00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:43,290
somebody's brookies me cat so he's not

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,440
gonna be like New York vs yeah

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,030
oh it's low like we're going to do

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,630
rotation together bring him in remotely

00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:54,000
so human part of all to get together

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,930
yeah you try if you celebrate the end of

00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,030
technologies on video calls together

00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,160
weekly wrapup swimming boot campers are

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:12,000
video calls me a weekly status meeting

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:14,400
we're always in IRC sadly how does one

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,610
get up high ground in New York sadly I

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,860
they just taught me the biggest areas

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,170
that we have popped so you have never

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:33,780
implied earlier in a meeting ever I

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:38,210
don't know what song it's so good so you

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:41,280
know your five little sore tenants of

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:44,190
successful epic orientation right how

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,280
much that was already existing in and

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,770
seeing how much you wearing to to the

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:54,090
table the reason i'm asking this is that

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:57,900
on part a large organization there's a

00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:02,110
lot of side loads right now these sort

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:06,150
of the concepts aren't there really

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:10,330
I think introducing those concepts of

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,950
thinking to be able too difficult so I

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,740
want to know if you have that experience

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,640
where that was are there or is that

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:21,100
something you brought in so much trance

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,860
some I have like I five ideas on how to

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,510
work together as a team how did that

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,250
today that Matt's here or something I

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,700
brought in and was that difficult to

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,530
bring in a good night um I think it was

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,710
the thing that this exists in pocket to

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:38,610
that team is until not eating modified

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:44,650
pretty damn cool how many better teams

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:47,350
say this but if they're open to it we're

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:50,559
a very question from new organizational

00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:52,299
so people are very happy to talk to you

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,370
and so I got away with it a lot easier

00:26:52,299 --> 00:27:03,130
than I might have back in my idea days

00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:06,610
to me but would you recommend for place

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:11,830
much smaller you know rather than having

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:14,830
an ops team you've got ops and option

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,350
person is doing everything so how do you

00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,660
really feel warmer relationship on that

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:23,890
basement you know some people are going

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,780
to need to use some more than others but

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,880
they're going crazy because the total on

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,050
the fire sale

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,830
so to have a handle it when your

people and you accept that maybe you're

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,560
not the conferring as much as that you

00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,380
your own top priority but you have to

00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,090
accept that you disrupt your off people
