00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,859
engineer autotrader all right for DevOps

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,900
com I know a lot of people are trying to

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,940
do this right now and there's

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,650
responsibility from the employer and

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,059
employee good and bad way to do

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,199
everything which is what I'm talking

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,410
about today so first thing I have y'all

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,080
to ask please stop telling me I thought

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,730
makes it a sign the devops engineer when

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,550
you're trying to break down silos and

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,990
you got the title like the versus admin

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,730
they tell you to go back to your side

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,380
load when you're like I'm a dead loss

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,719
engineer we break those down there like

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,500
oh well talk to you then so plenteous

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,090
likes is he questions my motors though

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,010
is my heart in the right place around my

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,750
self serving as the father is the

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,710
closest he's in a good position that's

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,629
this question yes every right to so and

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,340
as the closest margie involves into

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,050
tyranny and rule I woman is over thur

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,730
Meyer soccer see which involves an

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,010
oligarchy enrolled by a few is

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,260
overthrown by democracy which is

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,510
covering people but even they have

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,939
problems sometimes and democracy will

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,490
eventually evolved into mob rule which

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,130
is what happened against um they had

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,920
this culture of an apprenticeship

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,409
brewery where you were not allowed a

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,030
little burgers and I they were held in

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,820
such high regard especially if you were

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,159
willing and there are some bad managers

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,960
and think this is okay that for Guinness

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,490
we make quite beer that is awesome we

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,909
have awesome rivers and these are all

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,310
respect some truth there there's but we

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,890
need more talented people so we put as a

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,799
bad manager in that situation they go

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,439
find the a multi-dimensional talented

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,150
individual that is passionate about many

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,030
different things and capable of doing a

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,790
lot and they take this person and they

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,650
put them into the

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,980
organization on with those Prentiss

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,650
people burgers and to the bottom of war

00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:58,180
chart where they get like DevOps

00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,470
footstool or assistant whatever and they

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,720
all cases the support and the power they

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,020
need to make the change we're trying to

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,690
make right and putting that and the

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,310
expectation of the person who hired them

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,990
in this is where we get to the

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,240
soul-crushing park right this is not a

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,250
fun position being who's ever been stuck

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,410
in that position job before anybody

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:23,170
they've got a few hints left side income

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,240
cecil guinness and mr. christopher davis

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,480
latouche i'm not sure which one is Ned

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,280
Flanders but one of them is a good boss

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,040
and he takes a different approach to

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,310
this for sure beings are gonna go about

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,380
it friendly way he hires a bunch of stem

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,900
graduates oh shot on that and Jacob and

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,870
the whole chest I'll come to thing I did

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,550
cookie ops which I take that model boil

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,709
it down to something a ten-year-old can

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,920
understand and it fits what happened

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,670
against who in my opinion so the core

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,830
tenet of this is ice columns inclusion

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,380
complexity empathy culture automation

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,390
mean learning measurement sharing yes I

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,510
hit Del twice Lina learning go hand in

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,239
hand so what do we do with these nouns

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,239
and put them through the three ways

00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,880
right charlita that means three roads

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,739
but highest go straight into the first

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,209
way you want to make measurement

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,459
cheering and you want to create a

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,950
culture a little lean learning pretty

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,049
much there's a way of about this these

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,150
are tips on how to be creative they work

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,920
for a devops engineer too i thought the

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,950
star on willingness to look suited you

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,519
gotta be able to do that as well for

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,470
sure and one way to go in is asking

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,280
questions and try

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,170
research so Gossett got out with a guy

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,270
named Ethan who was a monster he didn't

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,540
like statisticians but he want to learn

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,580
about why his mult was awesome and when

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,230
he even saw that Gossett was using the

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,140
math to show how brilliant he was

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,030
Gossett got on board but Gossett had to

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,520
make students t-test to be able to do

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,280
this in the meeting of the t-test is you

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,440
get accurate statistical analysis with a

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,190
smaller sample let's drop cycle time so

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,810
does that sound familiar and you end up

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:13,920
coming up with really creative solution

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:16,170
at the audience figure out refrigeration

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,700
the burner pops and testings before they

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,019
went brewed make sure they were both

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,760
qualities of the beer came out

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,070
consistently in the way they wanted and

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,750
it's up a lot of wood chopping and water

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,110
carrying but you need operational

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,780
expense to do this to those guys the

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,850
part about guys the folks who are doing

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,830
the experimentation they need allowed

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,930
the raw materials and they need to be

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,540
able to burn through it as needed so

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,850
don't box of me and if you're not down

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,680
for that fight or you're not getting the

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,530
cooperation you need don't take the job

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,030
or go somewhere else there's no room for

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,000
bodily being with this it doesn't make

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,919
anybody's job easier I'm Chris Corriere

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,560
that's a link to the blog post this

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,060
ignite talk is based off of and I'll be

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,050
here on the day tomorrow if anybody
