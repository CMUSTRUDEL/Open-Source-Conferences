hi my name is Stephanie heart and today

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,990
I want to talk about your data and

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:11,849
handle dba's and data fit in dev ops my

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,190
background is a software development and

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,660
database development I've used Oracle

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,390
and sequel server in the past and this

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,330
is going to be biased around that but my

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,939
whole goal today is really to get us to

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,099
start thinking about the data and how

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,029
this fits in dev ops and also subscribe

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:33,360
the conversation with your DBA and I

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,190
purposely said your data because I want

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,559
us to start thinking about it being hard

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,980
at it even if you're not the DA is still

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,530
your data it's the business of data and

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,750
it's the critical data that's either

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,489
driving your application or that your

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,110
application is collecting that future

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,920
business decisions are going to be based

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,739
on so how does data and DDA's fit into

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,640
our theme here of inclusivity complex

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,899
systems and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,970
they and we really need to include the

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,850
database and the DBA as part of our

00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,420
discussion so the GPA is kind of a

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,070
special role within operations but we

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,660
can't forget about the data what good is

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,400
it we have a completely streamlined

00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,530
process and continuous delivery for our

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
application and then we have a manual

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,369
deployment for our database that's going

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,050
to be the bottleneck so we need to

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,659
include that as part of our complex

00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,900
system and as Dave said in this blog

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,720
that we can't man you manage these

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,070
manually I mean you tools in place so

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,470
there's some tools that can already

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,840
adopt from application development that

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,240
applies to the database so things like

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,160
your infrastructure automating the

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,929
installation of sequel server source

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,630
controlling your configurations you have

00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,390
a repeatable process and you create

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,250
multiple servers once that one source

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,770
control you need to get your database

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,929
into source control your database is

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,880
code your tables your functions or

00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:58,110
stored procedures especially your stored

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,310
procedures that they have business logic

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,890
in them in addition you want your static

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,229
data in source control so this is your

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,149
reference data your lookup tables

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,239
anything that you should be tracking

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,700
along that gasification and schema you

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,769
want a version and you need to be habit

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,630
as part of your deployment process so it

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:22,260
gets deployed to your other environments

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,269
introduction as a whole once it's in

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,160
source control you can't stop thinking

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,770
about continuous integration for your

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,470
deity

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,850
every time you make a change commit that

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,530
source control and automatically

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,110
building your database to validate those

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,840
scripts in the data source control

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,420
system and then you can actually unit

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,030
test your database just like a unit or

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,800
and unit you can get test result and

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,990
quick feedback on how your any of these

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,880
changes are impacting your test and you

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,490
can automate that and you want that

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,200
feedback to be really quick and then you

00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,060
have other kinds of automated testing

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,490
which is maybe like a nightly build or

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,680
ad hoc push of a button what you do

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,950
integration testing performance testing

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,760
load testing to give you more confidence

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,960
in your bill and in the database changes

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,840
once you have it source control what you

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,490
have CI your tests are confident you can

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,720
automate the deployment start thinking

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:18,940
about things like continuous delivery

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,500
and continuous deployment and you need

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,510
the confidence in this to be able to do

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,850
it again as a pusher line to go to

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,190
testing go to QA go to staging and

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,110
really make that repeatable and easy

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,490
especially heard complaint multiple

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,980
production environments or if you're

00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,170
doing a lot of releases in an agile girl

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,270
you might still want that manual

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,090
intervention on production before before

00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,350
pushing that button and finally that

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,760
brings me to empathy and understanding

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:48,750
the dba's concerns and how big work on

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,190
production system so we've heard that

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,260
developers all help you know making

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,060
great food and it came to the money to

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,830
release them as fast as possible that

00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,740
our end users

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,050
start getting value and the pvas are all

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,820
about the production the production

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,310
system and the passion of that

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,980
production system and this is really

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,540
where application and database start to

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,850
differ because when you just like

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,070
occupation you just overwrite what's on

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,540
corruption can't do that with your

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,760
database again it all comes back to your

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,730
data protecting meta you can't ever

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,610
write it you can't corrupt it jamie is

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,580
protected there's also situations where

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,010
your data is extremely sensitive so you

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,410
might not have access to your production

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,760
data and the first time you do is float

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,710
into production that may be the first

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,060
time you're actually testing it so the

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,430
better you can have a staging

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,430
environment to practice that deployment

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,580
beforehand it makes it makes the plumage

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,810
production master st also the DDA's of

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,450
the ones in the middle the night that I

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,070
got you a call it there's a problem so I

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,320
really like water like yeah let's give

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,730
the painters to the developers be see

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,210
how much they want to do a production

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,890
push them so again I hope this just kind

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,480
of gets you to start thinking about how

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,430
important data is and that can be

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,620
included in your doing processes and

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,540
just don't have a conversation with your

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,540
