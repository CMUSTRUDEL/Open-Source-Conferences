yes we talked to call them how I

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,519
co-operation closure so with this goes

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:17,010
uh as we had to state Pamela's everybody

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:20,580
hand go i won my name's Jacob Knox

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,080
engineer at simple some teams possible

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,330
for building infrastructure for the

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,859
other engineering teams it simple I'm

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,689
going to be talking about how our ops

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,519
team is using closure not a language

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,850
that you would particularly think of an

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,020
ops team in a bit of a misdirection

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,570
there this talk is not really about

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,829
closure it's more about sort of how we

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,170
use it to build these shared experiences

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,510
and use those shared experiences to

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,309
bridge this option dead gap that can

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,309
exist even in what we call a DevOps

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,289
organization so why did I mention

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,750
closure we have a lot of JDM this is

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,719
shared libraries common patterns so that

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,920
other teams are using soap to use a JDM

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,020
language like closure is a big

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,070
opportunity for insight into how other

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,510
teams work if I can sort of broadly

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,519
defined the problem this is the

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,740
generalization other teams need things

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,400
the cost of change is high and inside is

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,619
low this is sort of cross discipline

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,350
problem and so specifically in this

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,570
context i'm talking about engineers need

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,189
platform changes from ops and platform

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,650
being the infrastructure that supports

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,850
our business logic config management it

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,619
you know it can be kind of slow it's

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,509
still kind of young and so we have this

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,140
reactive versus preempted response to

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,060
needs and these are all barriers Tempe

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,340
so let's fix it I thought to myself one

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,810
day other teams are using the JDM I went

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,430
to my manager and I bonded on closure

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,360
anyway and he gave me the thumbs up to

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,780
experiment so I paired with another

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,910
engineer on our team in learning it for

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,760
few weeks and this sort of cool needed

00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,770
in writing my first service and I really

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,440
was able to step outside the ops box

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,630
here and be a consumer of our own

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,120
product and work using our service

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,640
libraries our CI system our

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,770
infrastructure etc and this would hand

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,560
in hand with op shipping into service

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,149
writing so you know the net realization

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,190
we have is deploying service is kind of

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,050
difficult and because of this context we

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,370
have around the platform the necessary

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,690
changes became much clearer to us and

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,100
this is a two-way street so one of the

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,260
awesome things have been watching other

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,120
engineers like PR back into the

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,470
infrastructure like PR like and fingers

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,150
for management or what have you and

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,040
we're starting conversations earlier

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,480
about you know giving feedback on what

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,150
works what doesn't work and where we

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,770
want to end up and as a team where we

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,900
ended up is we're still writing services

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,150
today primarily through this

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,970
well-defined platform interface that we

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,100
worked on with engineering and because

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,080
we work on it together there's this

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,480
shared ownership of the platform it's no

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,450
longer offices it's everyone's so

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,610
concreting stock mutation this empowers

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,680
people and allows us to define

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,709
interfaces which give us inclusivity and

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,380
anti complexity and the shared ownership

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,620
gives us empathy and inclusivity as well

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,090
as day this obviously isn't perfect we

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,590
saw the long ways to go and this is

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,239
either some teams to another just you

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,560
know our clients in particular like

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,019
we're still trying to figure out how to

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,060
work more cohesively and timing them

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,650
needs can be a challenge but this is

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,170
still a big improvement on what we had

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,630
before where changes were very difficult

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,489
in part because the objectives between

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,950
teams were very unclear and the workflow

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,790
between teams was very unclear I think

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,010
we all know these three words

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,630
frustration paying debt it's not that we

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,450
don't have them but we have much less of

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,799
it because of this work we get empathy

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,019
through an engineer's eating the same

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,299
dog food sharing the pain and the gain

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,680
of our work together and it's important

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,290
to have both because it should be a fun

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,200
and positive experience and having this

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,400
cross team collaboration

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,590
you know sort of builds up to

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,750
inclusivity so you know having

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,190
conversations about you know where we

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,450
what do we want to do how are we going

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,190
to develop these shared patterns

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,230
empowering other engineers to

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,030
participate you know like I said it's

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,300
not it's not opposites platform anymore

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,870
it's Engineering's and because of these

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,849
two things we have less complexity

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,530
shirring workflow is obviously not

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,840
having managing I'll manage all these

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,510
different workflows is simpler having it

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,620
easier to understand perspectives means

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,799
you can understand what people are

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,750
coming from so dearly art we inherited

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,220
the workflow of other teams we felt the

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,919
pain of deploying services became

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,510
customers of our own platform and the

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,970
result was positive changes that we

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:32,740
worked on with all of engineering so how

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,270
to get there now I create the space to

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,860
experiment that's how this started it

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,720
was an experiment you know ask yourself

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,870
what tools and languages other teams are

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:45,370
using step outside your team's point of

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,169
view and sort of box I guess and look at

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,229
where you can gain perspective across

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,700
engineering nicotine and so because the

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,950
goal is the gain other teams perspective

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,870
and so anything can do this and if you

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,850
do it'll it'll stop being about I think

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,560
ops and debs and all these individual

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,139
teams but engineers working together

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,300
towards this common goal so thank you I

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,870
i do have twitter and i do have an email

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,300
address simply icon / critters i'm sort

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,590
of obligated to plug that of course I'll

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,669
be here willing to talk about it is

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,669
thank you so much for listening

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,229
