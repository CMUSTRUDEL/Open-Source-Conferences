our next speaker is an ex-marine helping

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,179
sell a computer Keith he's also a father

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,730
speaking being a father so I have two

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,139
boys and there are four and five and one

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,059
of the games that we like to play is

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,300
about this this really skinny tall

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,859
individuals glasses like Red Hat but I

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,029
want everybody to know about a wall that

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:27,480
one so our next speaker is well know

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,050
who's getting set up right now and that

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:43,739
was my poor to the trying to tie its

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:45,379
parent yourself thank you what three

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,210
patients but also being fairly it's

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,910
fantastic to see so many so many friends

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,360
at over four or heads new friends this

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:59,570
is fantastic so I am the last thing

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:05,220
before lunch you have to get through me

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:07,020
to get so but I thought this is fun so

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,420
when you're giving a presentation you

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,100
you should tell us story and

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,229
unfortunately the thing I want to talk

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,150
about doesn't really lend itself well to

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,070
a single story that's right yeah it

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,290
would be a story with innumerable

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,960
possibilities it would be a story of

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:30,020
every team every person in every

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,240
possible conceivable time deep

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,740
it's a bastards asked understatement to

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,189
say that every person is different and I

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,189
assure you this letter

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,280
this is exponentially true for every

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,170
team now it's it's it's impossible to

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,869
tell every story I will talk with

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,100
possibilities and hope that some of them

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,659
resonate with you so welcome to so you

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,740
might be hired as a nation of change

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,409
here's your helmet so in order to get

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:11,870
the processes are getting hired as an

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:16,470
agent of change step 1 run fast run hard

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,599
there is no stunt - it's not for the

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,440
faint of heart or the in politic or

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,330
those who lack patience is stressful

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,209
frustrating and to be frankly quite

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,950
ain't some of these experiences have

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,950
even made me question my own worth

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:45,599
so if there is no step 2 ladies and

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:47,730
gentlemen much so as stories of the

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,940
successes and love of our culture spread

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,790
more companies want to jump start their

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,590
own DevOps shift now this might sound

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,230
appealing for a number of reasons why

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,890
you would want to take this job but I

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,329
assure you the path is from a peril so

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,209
what I want to provide you with the

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:09,780
perspective DevOps you are the safety

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,900
equipment so that your your sanity and

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:19,590
career satisfaction remain intact so

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,660
breathing I'm a geek come from

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,040
assistance background so I know every

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,200
possible way that you can break

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,760
something QED if you really care about

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,700
knowing some of them it's on LinkedIn

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,900
but I assure you I don't I'm told them

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,850
they look especially appropriate today

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,650
this is not normal and for that I

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,389
apologize I didn't know what the

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,120
audience would be is expecting that word

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:49,019
finance thought this would be dressed

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:59,130
down also you should be prepared to know

00:03:49,019 --> 00:04:01,200
that I love or anybody says anything so

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,150
this is not specific to any one company

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,269
that is collected from my cumulative

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,940
experiences and stories and Sherry's

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:14,669
from my friends readers as many stories

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,880
I've heard in experience this isn't

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,919
really it is make stories as I have

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,780
experience and this isn't really

00:04:19,919 --> 00:05:55,700
anything more than lessons from Andy

00:04:21,780 --> 00:06:00,710
so this is higher you could have the

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:03,270
actual so those were fantastic thank you

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,220
everything I could come up with on my

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,470
own

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,260
could be boiled down to two reasons

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,169
either they want to do more the same

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,539
including replacing the partner or then

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:19,560
looking to fill the need that they can't

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:24,570
do they can't serve right now how do

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:27,000
companies hire a new interviews there's

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,169
luck that's wrong and I really want to

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,849
focus on two things

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:34,520
and those two mobile crossword

00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:37,810
now interviews are skeptical

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:42,500
and off on schedule rigorously there so

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:45,110
long enough I see 30 minutes might tell

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,889
you that somebody's no but as an hour of

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,509
time to tell you that the ring yes is

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:58,479
that enough time for them to decide

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:58,479
whether they the second problem

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:07,000
everybody lies it's often not

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,130
intentional but what they're telling you

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,560
will not always come to be true from

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,169
your perspective between agreeing on

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,720
what terms mean to having an objective

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:20,199
view on qualities what they're saying so

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:25,789
you cannot how especially that an hour

00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:28,039
on a mutual understanding some things

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:32,659
are going to be overstated and so we're

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:40,280
going to be understand the good and this

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:43,810
is going to be hard for you to sort the

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,810
worst part is that won't be consistent

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,930
what does it mean when they say they

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,880
have some automation what about when

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:58,430
they say engineers are empowered to make

00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:02,750
decisions these will go about yes

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:05,210
selection sir but I've been told many

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,210
times that engineers are empowered but

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:12,110
the reality that I've seen in several

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,150
occurrences is that this is Tripper that

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,280
for all the trivial decisions they have

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,680
to be approved by management like there

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,479
there's a risk aversion such that you

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:27,380
can't break out the way you think you

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:29,030
should so uh asking how often asking

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,190
them during their interviews how often

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,839
they get to choose to pay down some of

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,630
their technical debt can be very telling

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:40,340
because that's a very not business

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:42,560
priority piece of work

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,660
you have to decide where the uncertainty

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:51,650
lies and if that's good enough for you

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:53,690
how much is your tolerance remember you

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,779
are interviewing them too

00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:02,120
they make the first acceptance by making

00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:02,690
you an offer you get to say no so on to

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,390
it

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:10,480
you're considering a role and during

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,480
interviews or discussions yes it's where

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:19,160
you're gonna want to pay attention to

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:23,150
how often you hear this and before you

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:26,000
might stop and ask them what do you mean

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,850
when you say DevOps discussions are

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,770
going to happen and that's a huge thing

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,230
is it is the business done less poorly

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,470
it warrants discussion don't shy away

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,240
from the sore spots and the things I

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,850
like to poke at are getting the

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,290
developers on the pager and having the

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:52,190
operations teams keeping developers for

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:57,410
botching axis so this is the Gartner

00:09:52,190 --> 00:10:01,490
hype cycle you're gonna want to compare

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:05,300
the DevOps per minute rate against this

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,050
chart and doing so you can roughly age a

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,630
team's

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,110
DevOps maturity and before you tweet

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:20,720
that no DevOps maturity is not a thing

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:22,460
stop yes so in your in your discussions

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,120
you want to figure out what role do they

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,920
want me to play the garment are you the

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:34,540
Evangelist

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:34,540
the fight Claire here's the thing

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:58,600
if they wanted this culture show that's

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,019
why we we want this culture shift we

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:13,750
keep hearing it but we don't know where

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:16,230
everybody wanted this so they might say

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,899
they've clean a voice to show the way

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:23,079
this is not one of the bunnies you need

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:25,240
to be the person with the treats now

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:29,889
this this person that they won't hire it

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:32,050
cannot be a cure influencer none of the

00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:36,930
bunnies are leaving the way that person

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,930
is a director in order to be successful

00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,980
you can't do all the things you cannot

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:47,889
change all the lines easier said than

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:52,540
done in anything in here is going to be

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:54,250
very appropriate and you want you to

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,680
hear something like well it's okay we

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,620
might we might you'd be an engineer you

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,779
just just don't get consensus just like

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,790
that easy

00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,870
the problem here is expectations once

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,880
they hire you

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:12,790
they think they've done this so then you

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,130
you do your onboarding and you'll cure

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,010
so great well we'll have you do meet

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:21,149
daily with all of the stakeholders to

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:23,800
discuss their needs in your progress

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,440
it might be reasonable for you to ask

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,449
them to describe a timeline of

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,579
expectations and goals which would be

00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,319
fabulous

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:37,569
too bad the work they need looks like

00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:38,889
this because in your interview they're

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:40,360
gonna talk about the office of things

00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,029
that they wanted elect engineers

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,740
deployment pipelines and dashboards but

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,009
in your due diligence you're gonna ask

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,920
about the boring foundational things

00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:55,480
like centralized look modern

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,100
instrumentation contextualise alerts how

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,990
do you ensure that machines on the same

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,560
who'll have the same

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,440
face do you even see how and how does

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:20,339
that work

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:24,140
how's your documentation why don't you

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,140
tell me about your agile transformation

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,770
incidentally this is a campground in

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,770
Pripyat Ukraine

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,890
do you require the test pass before code

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:47,100
is deployed our developers first

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:50,250
responders two pages how soon after

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,170
minimal Viable Product do you prioritize

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,279
and ensure that things aren't anti

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:58,380
fractured and highly event how long do

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,839
you have that how many people have ever

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,870
had a beta thing slip into production

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:10,320
this is business critical like in five

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:19,860
minutes so what happens when failure

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:22,589
occurs what do post-mortems look are

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,720
those problems identified in your

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,750
post-mortem prioritizes the most

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,300
important work it's broken proof that

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:34,740
this has been break things down why is

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:37,770
that prioritized what tools do you run

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:42,899
in-house versus what you pay for as a

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:44,690
service so the answer to these is not

00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,570
gonna be Kelly you know we've got stats

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,600
and our alerts first try some automated

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,070
offenses before wake somebody up and

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,070
everything's in config management or

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:16,199
most we've got this monitoring tool you

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:28,079
have to click around and to get new

00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:30,150
machines at being the responsible

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,550
professional that you are you're going

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,350
to tell them that continuously deliver

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,980
into production many times a day is

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:43,020
fantastic but you have a lot of

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,940
foundation order first driving at any

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:51,089
speed when you can't see through the

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:53,120
windscreen is reckless you can tell you

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,589
need to talk to the real stakeholders

00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:06,959
preferably before you really get in the

00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:09,029
door who are the people who really get

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,430
them in the room for an hour - you need

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:16,140
real talk

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:19,709
don't let it be an interview you're here

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,209
to get to know them and but this is the

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:24,209
easiest time to make uninformative

00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:28,620
judgments don't offer a solution to beer

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:30,510
you need to absorb also be cognizant of

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,170
your superpower you're coming in with

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,170
fresh eyes

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:55,320
remember just like Soylent Green DevOps

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:59,500
yeah they know what's hurting them but

00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,680
they can't help you to help them they're

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:07,449
too busy and they've always been too

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:11,550
busy and by now they even seal me out so

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,550
they're gonna depend on you to save them

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,250
they may have lost hope

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:17,410
because they're used to bring up

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,309
concerns and having them get overwritten

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:23,110
or disappointed they have projects to

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,390
improve their there on the or they're on

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,740
the schedule there on the budgets but

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,740
they spend all their time firefighting

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:39,460
this might be a sign Courtney is not

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:41,230
aligned with responsibilities so you're

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,590
going to want to get an idea what the

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,820
org chart looks like not only do you

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,059
want to find out if it's managed about

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:53,290
heavy like we've got say 30 engineers

00:17:49,059 --> 00:18:03,460
and you've got 25 managers or director

00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:04,900
distantly how far not only you want to

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,429
find out for this management maybe you

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,760
want to find out how far you want for

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:12,490
dealing with real decisions this is not

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,340
a power play I assure you this is to

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,020
help ensure that you are successful if

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,470
you have to get buy-in for every word

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,470
you say

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,270
this agent of change needs to be

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:32,070
empowered to direct change and it

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,650
doesn't mean if I would record but you

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:40,050
need to have a role that you can say

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:42,720
things and don't have to argument they

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,800
are explicitly this this company that

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,140
you're looking at like they are

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,130
explicitly looking for someone to undo

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,930
bad decisions not bad in a value

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,870
judgment like your horrible person and

00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,870
you should feel better but in retrospect

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,350
in hindsight or at least is no longer a

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:11,180
good idea to do this

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:11,180
I'm sure handing that too bad right

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,970
be wary if they want to hire if they

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:21,870
want change but they're hiring you to be

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:24,570
a leader if so you might actually prefer

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,990
people consultant so you hire an

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:31,280
employee versus hiring a consultant

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:33,300
infertile very vastly different paradise

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,830
employees are paid to do the work

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:40,440
they're told to do a consultant is paid

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,600
to give advice now as always the company

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,810
is free to ignore that advice and their

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,710
suggestions that's so you don't have to

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:58,710
live with the consequences of their bad

00:19:49,710 --> 00:20:00,690
decisions so let's pretend we should

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,510
really listen to me but let's say you've

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,880
taken the job and now you need to worry

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,520
yourself you need to figure out how big

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:16,980
the best really is so you need to show

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:19,320
them the great news the great news is

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,510
that they've done some stuff maybe

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,540
that's the stuff you would have done but

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,830
there's some stuff you can see how

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:30,350
things can be improved actually that's

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,350
pretty awesome self change that

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,310
but be careful about making suggestions

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,870
because here an hour you're gonna get

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:45,810
invites you have to be careful about the

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:47,670
change that you bring be careful about

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,830
the change you're going to bring these

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:52,140
been trying to introduce too much too

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,690
quickly you're going to find yourself on

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,960
the wrong end of an immune reaction from

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:04,530
the company you have the company eleven

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:12,180
immune response to hyper sensitized just

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:14,570
like any good as allergies so you're an

00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,010
outsider and you will be for some time

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,610
you need to reassure them that we are

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:24,150
there to help you're trying to make

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,890
things better but prepare to have

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,500
arguments

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,890
lots of not that you shouldn't be able

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,890
to defend your reasoning but they're

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,720
going to be defensive because you are in

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,650
fact challenging the work that they've

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,960
been doing you might have some

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,510
outlandish ideas but you have a target

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,510
you see some things that you can solve

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,250
as much as I love the scope and the

00:21:51,300 --> 00:22:01,410
sentiment behind it this does not

00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:04,890
actually work all that so I found that

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:07,380
it's harder in my personal experience to

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,200
to predict how well new products are

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,270
going to be received so here's a diet I

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,370
spent an hour to making a diagram

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,530
describing the life cycle of going for a

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:24,290
different employer who touches one when

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:24,290
and where buffets go or I set up a week

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:35,090
there there can be a joy that is out of

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:39,410
proportion to your expectations so hard

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:51,230
you go fantastic for my next act ears

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:52,730
long stache they seem under well but you

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,920
don't have to log into boxes to check

00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:00,320
their logs anymore they're collected all

00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:04,280
in one place you can get stats from your

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:11,540
logs you can get alerts and trigger

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:13,700
actions on them look from your logs its

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:20,690
config manage it's highly available it's

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:25,400
easily ceremony you might have a couple

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:30,680
feels right about here yeah and what you

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:45,740
have here is failure to and when you

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:47,090
have a failure to communicate some of

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,270
what I've described might sound

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:54,490
Machiavelli but we could have to realize

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:56,810
is that he broke the prince on a puff I

00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,700
wrote this presentation to help us

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:04,840
succeed in these transformations and

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,840
maintain our satisfaction I want us to

00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:16,900
so on Tuesday I'm sitting at work and

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm trying to get something why are you

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,250
yeah two days ago I'm in a moderate

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,830
state of freak out because this

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,730
presentation that we're standing here is

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:30,970
not coming together how I'd like this

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,970
before

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,370
and I realized that some of the

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,300
frustration that I've experienced in in

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:46,590
these roles and stories that I heard

00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:51,000
servants sometimes familiar I'm an

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:53,970
outsider I'm vastly outnumbered I have

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,370
radical ideas and there are a lot of

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,630
well-intentioned people who don't see

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:03,290
how they're hurting themselves and

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:06,390
others that despite everything I say

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:09,690
being in the team's best interest its

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,130
benign skeptically there's endless

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,870
discussion and argument and

00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:17,970
second-guessing that I feel like I'm not

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:29,070
being listened to it occurred to me that

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:32,810
this might be lips from where I sit in

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,450
might I like to call fighting privilege

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:40,530
it was a revelation

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:48,990
there may have been some messages so I'd

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:55,650
like to leave you with busy that's what

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:59,850
it was it this is really going through

00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:07,550
this experience is a fantastic way to

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:07,550
get dose about the like

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:20,830
so my personal parallel tale of two

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,830
peers it was the best of coffee it was

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:36,110
first time I never encountered a cure

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:55,790
was this one small office and there were

00:26:36,110 --> 00:27:02,200
rules you make your coffee if the water

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:02,200
gets so not everybody follow the rules

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,770
frustrations happen there are things

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:14,570
that behind closed doors

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:17,170
the next place like false manicure so

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,170
first

00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,590
so pretty soon as you might expect it at

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:42,960
all the bunch of people need to copy at

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:45,960
the same time so I witnessed they the

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,350
first person took their cup thing pop

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:54,690
but the room made coffee drip truth

00:27:49,350 --> 00:28:00,240
gurgle next person removes the cuff puts

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:06,419
their thing in not a single side to be

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:10,140
had it's easy to realize that your

00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:14,850
expectations frame your outlook and it's

00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,200
hard to do in a minute if I realize that

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,590
the old company that the roof was

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,780
arbitrating stupid them you know like

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,419
remove my cup I'll be a good citizen but

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,030
not really care there's been so much

00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:29,970
less angst at that stupid place about

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:33,720
this stupid tiny thing that thing's like

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:35,700
two seconds so try to be cognizant when

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,250
you're having one of those feels about

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,950
somebody else's they try to be in the

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:49,289
moment that your your framing your

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:52,530
expectations so in closing it's easy and

00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:53,789
likely even for the things that that I'm

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,919
describing the things that I've tried

00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:58,190
they may not work it's likely that they

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,260
won't they'll work differently for you

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,330
the hope is that by what we talked about

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,820
here can help you to have a great life

00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,940
and bring about the change that you want

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:14,090
to see in the world and if nothing else

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,090
I urge you to fail your way to success

00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,440
I'll also give you a bonus case

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:52,640
questions I was actually thrilled

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,930
because we didn't have to do with the

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,150
thing of you know you got the share of

00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:58,460
coffee pot and that one person every

00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,680
time always with them I left a shot

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,940
glass worth of coffee in so I was

00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:08,410
thrilled happier

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,410
