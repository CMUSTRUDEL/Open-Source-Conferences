since everyone I'm Jeff Wong my topic my

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:30,840
topic is challenges in translation team

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:36,970
for example Taiwan yeah and about me I'm

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:42,690
KD traditional Chinese translator yeah

00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:47,860
and cha-cha-cha colonies picture and

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,760
lyubov is also tradition traditional

00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,440
Chinese native language approach project

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,080
member and the

00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:08,890
TDF member and the also translates XFC

00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:10,150
and met yeah and next one this is my

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,720
community

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:22,569
it is localization Taiwan no ten and one

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:33,700
yeah and the that is that is our local

00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:35,639
and you can this is a lion pass it in in

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:42,310
Taiwan style yeah

00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:49,509
and this this is my this is our github

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:55,179
organization we can see each has 13

00:01:49,509 --> 00:02:04,829
members but not all active yeah only

00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:11,819
about two or three are active so yeah we

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:19,200
we are legs we relaxed of main power and

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:19,200
this is our Potti sauce site

00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:32,379
not so active but yeah just that okay

00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:35,379
finally we can we can talk about KDE

00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,379
yeah

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:51,440
first we can see our Elton and KDE we

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:56,180
can see lol tenant Arcadia okay yeah and

00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:02,540
the tenant our genome calcio we can see

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:09,280
that's not not so not so many difference

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:14,689
in its you iPads but genome genomes

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:22,189
you can upload translation file direct

00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:27,379
into turret there it's using web UI yeah

00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:32,510
and the next one we can see how to how

00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:38,530
to update our translation yeah we can

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:45,199
see like xfce and Matt they use

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:49,190
transfect translate is translation press

00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,699
phone based on web and ever as QT and

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:57,859
the eggs

00:03:49,699 --> 00:04:00,609
eh de use puto it's it can it can host

00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:07,639
yourself

00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:11,720
yeah and the next one we are KD Taiwan

00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:18,859
and the that is KDE China they use quad

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:26,270
in managing the translation yeah

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:31,810
recently but yeah so they use called the

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:37,060
input they they still need some

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:45,240
process to to make to make sure

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:49,150
translation file to let Katie use and

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:56,669
this is web lat

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:59,290
it's also like it's is such as like puto

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:05,740
yeah you can you

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:06,690
you also can host yourself in the next

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:13,510
one

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:19,020
Hotspur Institute is up means yeah you

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:24,370
know and okay D yeah again genome has

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:30,729
you can see a l10n touch number out they

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:36,340
have every venture version in different

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:43,270
branch you can see just a three three

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:47,080
points 25 22 and 24 yeah in different

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:54,220
branch then you can you can see its burn

00:05:47,080 --> 00:06:02,669
she heads yeah like like like this but

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:07,419
KDE we just have trunk and stable and

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:12,610
with recently we have our TS mountain

00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:15,760
support wrench but I think it is not

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:21,330
clear of difference group like

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:28,200
frameworks we know it is use trunk

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:33,550
wrench and the applications we use both

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:39,300
trunk and stable path trunk but wrongful

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,300
mr. branch in get and stay PO for

00:06:39,909 --> 00:07:00,149
like now it should be 17 17 points

00:06:49,659 --> 00:07:09,249
Oh 504 yeah it should be in a plasma

00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:12,039
plasma use all these branches and you

00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:17,139
know we even have a playground and s

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:22,259
track here but we don't know how up

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:25,419
string will use them and use what branch

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:30,069
because we have trunk we have stable we

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:34,209
have long-term support but in different

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,749
group we use different branch and it's

00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:43,959
nuts

00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:48,689
I don't know conclusions I think we

00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:59,499
should at least make a web UI like

00:07:48,689 --> 00:08:02,559
genome or XFC or math or LS QT yeah we

00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:08,619
can direct use web UI to upload

00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:14,429
translation and it is more it is easier

00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:18,759
for beginners and furthermore we can

00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:22,769
even switch to the web let's end up put

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:30,309
or puto yeah you can you can host these

00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:36,909
you can host it yourself no no it should

00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:41,560
be process but I think we we we can we

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:44,969
can use them and we can make translators

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,969
life easier

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:54,190
famous thanks for your listening

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:56,510
[Applause]

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,840
thanks Jeff we have time for just one

00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,840
question

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:09,890
any question just it's a comment because

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:15,470
the some of the topics were touched in

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:17,330
my talk previously so the about which

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,480
branch is started by what I understand

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,550
it can be confusing sometimes we send

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,210
out the email which says hey we move at

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,870
this branch to track this these master

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,520
master or applications or whatever it is

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,940
one solution for that is to use summit

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,310
which puts together all the branches in

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,020
one file so you just have one branch to

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,480
translate and you don't have to care

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,970
which one about the web UI and about you

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,560
know even in my one of my slides I said

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,510
one of the possible solution for our

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,820
website it was which two down that lies

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,470
which is the infrastructure is back

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,720
gnome and about

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,820
butall or rather another tool has

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,530
discussed it many times there is a list

00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,510
of requirements that must be fulfilled

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,790
so and there is a shortage of manpower

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,860
so when someone will come out with a

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,240
working demo which works in our

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,760
environment then it's fine

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:14,620
it will be set up and working but we

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,620
