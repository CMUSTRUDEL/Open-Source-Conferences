Title: Antonio Larrosa - The KDE Community and Its Ecosystem - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	The KDE Community is large and diverse. It encompasses persons with different cultures and different views on many topics but still all share a common goal on the KDE project.

At the same time, the KDE community is not alone in the digital world. There are other communities around us which may have different goals but also may share some of our ideas. How can we take advantage of this? Which are those communities? How can we collaborate more with those other communities and let them collaborate with us too?

Thank You Patrick okay so I think maybe

00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:56,010
most of you know me but just in case I'm

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,670
Antonio LaRussa and I have prepared a

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:05,010
small slide here to introduce myself

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:08,250
yes I'm Kelly developer since the 97

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,000
that's been a long time ago I've made

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,610
I've helped it in any way I can to Kelly

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,360
during those times when we were very few

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,420
people and from 98 or something like

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,610
that until 2000 something I made

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,220
something like 100 conferences around

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,840
Spain in all kind of events here mostly

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,230
at universities since 2013

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,830
I've been a developer currently I'm at

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:41,250
the working of the flea desktop team if

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:45,120
you know as Salinas enterprise currently

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,460
doesn't have the KDE desktop included so

00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,570
it's not easy it's not direct to

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,640
instantly but as part of my job has been

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,840
I've been creating care packages for

00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,990
sleep and there is now a way to for

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,230
heavy users on Salinas and applies to to

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:08,690
use carries I've been the president of

00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:12,810
Korea spaniel since last year okay this

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:17,909
is my first conference the first time I

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,600
went to a KD developer group and you can

00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:23,970
see that we were very down there and the

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,420
guy next to the column

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,690
and you can see also here that that we

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,730
were very few people we were in this

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,460
picture I think we are something like 50

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,740
something and of course a few developers

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,690
that couldn't come to taniyama this

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,660
habitat in inner London in the

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,520
University of London next to new Mac and

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,190
there are few developers that couldn't

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:52,140
come like Sita from India like Roberto

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:56,370
from Argentina like away from Namibia

00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:02,700
and probably forgot some others but we

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:05,310
were see very few people see if we can

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,380
compare that with this picture from a

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,760
couple of years ago we can see that we

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:15,270
are quite a lot more sorry no this is

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:21,000
from a greeny greeny we can see that

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:23,100
yeah we are grown a lot we have grown

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,260
quite a lot in the diversity and we are

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,360
very different people all around the

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,420
world now we can see here another

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,360
picture of the community in India this

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,959
is from cons kadhi in I think that's

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,720
from this year last year okay sorry

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,880
that's from last year but we can see

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,890
that we have grown a lot and for example

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,870
when we are started there were not such

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,870
a community in India at all right I

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,150
think there was one person only yeah

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,920
we have been growing in all kind on all

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,070
places around the world

00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,090
this is from the 20th event of the kadhi

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:03,510
anniversary in Beijing in China and we

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,670
can see here that we've grown both in

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,860
number of developers but also in

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,690
diversity we are come with it from

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,230
different cultures we have different

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,780
ways of thinking that requires different

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,299
skills now to communicate between each

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,430
other then we need it when we have

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,640
started and this is something important

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,830
that I think that we have to keep in

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,900
mind and I think that we are keeping

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,860
that in mind and Kelly is great for that

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,300
but it's important to remember that it's

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,220
important for everyone to be comfortable

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,190
here that we have

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,990
can a code of conduct and the code of

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,210
conduct is not something big that you

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,850
have to really like like a book but is

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:49,060
actually a few pages long and you can

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,120
read it but that webpage it's quite

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,540
short and it's it's summarize it by

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,570
these points okay the first one is be

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,030
considerate do you have to keep in mind

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,520
that when you are doing some change when

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,770
you are taking some decision that

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,730
decision affects others and you have to

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,810
keep in mind that that decision I mean

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,320
there's other people that are affected

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,450
by your decisions but they can be you

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,840
cannot like it and you have to think

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:24,010
about that thoughtfully second point is

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,430
be respectful of course there is no we

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:32,920
don't tolerate any kind of violent

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:36,750
discussion or or how I want works we

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:44,800
don't tolerate any kind of sexual or

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:46,510
religion discussion at all so far I

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,669
think we have never had any problem with

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,580
that and that's great that's what means

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,669
we are doing good and we should keep

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,940
doing that the third point is to be

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,860
collaborative yeah that's very important

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,050
in all kind of free software communities

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,180
that's the basic that's the core of of

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,680
the free software communities to

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,350
collaborate with other people and to

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,290
share everything that we know and to be

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,270
there for other people that need or hats

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,730
yeah that's something I think that is

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,850
shown in the previous the previous

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,890
pictures if we if we have been growing a

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,020
lot then that's because we have been

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,140
collaborating well with all those people

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,870
that are in this in those pictures the

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,220
pragmatics is also an important point

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,720
when there are different solutions for

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,570
any kind of problem you have to take the

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,000
most pragmatic solution maybe it's not

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,090
the best theoretical solution but we

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,169
have to be to be real and to find

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,700
solution that actually work okay and

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,970
then of course we have to support others

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,240
in the community and get support

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,760
others in the in the community that's

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,630
basically a way of collaborating with

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,640
other people and you know if you feel

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,940
that somebody else is if you see

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,680
somebody that needs some help or maybe

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,690
you see some discussion that you are not

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,670
part of but you can see that there's

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,320
been a discussion going on then there's

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,020
a community working group that you can

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:20,570
contact and they will probably take care

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:24,770
of that so those are very important

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,910
points a way of working on that it's not

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:31,460
exactly summarizing but it's something

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,960
that can be improved in order to help

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,870
with all those previous points is

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,950
working on empathy and last year at the

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,810
academy we had a whole keynote only

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,170
talking about empathy and I think it was

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,200
very good and if you have some time I

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,120
didn't put the URL here but you can

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,990
search for it on the on the web and

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,910
watch it because it's very good you know

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,480
empathy is very important for us because

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,390
for example when somebody new approaches

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,970
us and tries to submit a patch for us

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,330
and the patch is rejected with no that

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,669
won't work

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,180
then this person might get discouraged

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,070
and I have not seen that happening but I

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,650
have seen things that could be improved

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:19,700
in that way and we could use more kind

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,300
in work and try to same instead of no

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,419
that won't work

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,220
please we can say for example that's a

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,640
great solution but I think it could be

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,560
improved this way and maybe you could

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:34,010
try this and that and submit it again

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,740
please you think kind of work is

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,020
important for new people to get started

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,440
in your community and this is quite

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:45,530
important also empathy is an important

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,420
word because I think that most people in

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,839
this room actually at some point in time

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,560
thought I would like to be like a Spock

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:58,700
who didn't think of that like that

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,610
okay few people see but actually what

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:05,480
happen sorry

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:09,470
actually everybody has feelings at the

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:18,769
end and we cannot we cannot work around

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:34,040
that and if I said the buttons as I said

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:38,269
everyone has feeling and we should try

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,370
not to not to hurt anyone do you have to

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,510
also to keep in mind that as I said

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,279
before we all come from different

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,589
cultures from different parts of the

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,290
world and maybe something that we say

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,750
that we are easy to say and we are

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,540
common with that and you don't care is

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,089
sounds very a bit bad that what we are

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,279
used to say some things maybe for other

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,610
cultures is not so common and maybe they

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:04,760
find something violent or if they find

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:09,610
something wrong yeah we have to keep in

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:14,829
mind because for example it's a kind of

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,829
poll how many of you come from Europe

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,130
how many are how come come from UK

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:36,210
or yeah I mean the continent not the

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:38,970
political political thing how many of

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:44,280
you come from the America North and

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:46,350
South America okay a few how many of you

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,200
come from Asia that meet with India and

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,830
China okay

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,880
quite a lot happy that's great from

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,510
Australia

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,260
is there anyone from there or New

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:05,400
Zealand you know okay so we have place

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:08,730
to grow we have we can maybe do some

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,530
events there or something okay so so far

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,470
I've been talking about our community

00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:19,740
but our ecosystem also includes other

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:21,960
communities around us and yeah we are

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,040
Kerry of course I think you already know

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:28,320
that an erroneous we have many

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,350
distributions of course I have only put

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,930
a few of them there are many more I

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,760
don't think I don't have to say that and

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,980
sorry if your distribution is not there

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,740
I don't have a space in it even if I use

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,050
it 20 slides to write all the

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,040
distributions but yeah I'm sorry if

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,190
George is not there but as I said we

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,250
have distributions that are working on

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,590
KDE somehow and we have we are

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,130
generating software for them then

00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:02,130
there's also the cute company the cute

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,540
community that is around us and it's

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,700
generating a lot of software that we use

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,700
and at the same time there are many key

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:13,290
developers contributing to too cute we

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,090
have the genome community as you see in

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,280
many of those cases not only you know

00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,700
but many of those cases the communities

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,370
have different goals from that from us

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,990
but we can work with them and we have to

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,910
work with them and we have to

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,730
collaborate with them and in the case of

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:32,420
genome is especially important because

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:37,020
some people may may think that they are

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,820
the enemy or something like that but

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,160
actually we have to work with them and

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,960
call

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,800
as we have been doing in the free

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,750
desktop war probes and I think that's

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,540
important to continue this collaboration

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,910
and continue collaborating with them we

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,150
have also other desktops except CA and

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,210
as before I cannot write every one of

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:02,350
them but yeah we have the new community

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,700
then X or Whalen developers we are using

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,720
them at some point we have to

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:10,420
collaborate with them then we have other

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,880
communities that we don't actually use

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,950
directly the code that they develop but

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,250
we use the data that they provide for us

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:21,970
in this case Wikimedia OpenStreetMap

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,800
like musicbrainz and meta brains we have

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,000
the fruits of your foundation but I

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,090
think the liberal of his document

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,070
foundation the open source initiative

00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:37,000
the physical nation in Europe there are

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:39,400
many many communities around us that at

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,320
some point in time we have to talk to

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,050
them we have to communicate with them

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,600
and then they are so individual

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,700
developers that are in the home working

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,790
at some point maybe they contribute a

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,640
patch maybe at some point they they

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,410
start collaborating with us maybe they

00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,540
are working another application that

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,360
just uses some Cavey library and they

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,070
are not really an actual part of the

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,140
Acadia community but they are using the

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,420
calories and at some point we have to

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,490
talk to them and this means as you see

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:13,330
quite a lot of communities this is only

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,860
a small representation and yeah we have

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,140
to talk to all of them we have to keep

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:21,130
in mind that all of them have different

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:24,610
goals in some cases they may clash with

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,860
us and some on some other cases we can

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,600
actually collaborate and work together

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,600
in order to benefit each other

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,380
this means something that I want to

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,950
share with share with you with this

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,260
slide which is that this is a picture of

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,660
one of the bars in my city in Malaga and

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,670
you can see here that many people like

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,339
to drink coffee in different ways this

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,040
is the different names that are given to

00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,910
our glass of coffee depending on the

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,310
proportion between

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,260
coffee and milk and you can see that we

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,870
give different names so that everyone

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,730
can come to the bar and asked the waiter

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,070
directly for what he wants so in the

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,980
same way people work with in different

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,920
very different ways even if they use the

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,560
same tools this is a slide I took a

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,240
picture I took from a paper that I found

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:20,320
while researching for the keynote if

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:23,170
kind of old paper from 2012 but it's

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,110
very clear here that they analyze it how

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,630
people use Bugzilla okay and in this

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,990
case we can see in each of those graphs

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:39,970
its note each point is one developer or

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:46,120
one user axilla and each edge is how do

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:48,250
you say a collaboration relationship

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,320
between one developer one user and

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,040
another okay and you can see here that

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,380
in Gen 2 for example everything is is

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,630
mostly together in one one section but

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,210
in Kelley we have different clusters

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,180
with different working groups that work

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,430
together but mostly separate from each

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,890
other and in actives and especially in

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,690
that means there is a still a completely

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,720
different way and each developer

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,660
practically works along there and talks

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,350
only to a very few people so this means

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,990
that even if if all those projects that

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,090
I showed here use the same tools we use

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,700
it in different ways and for example if

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,010
you have to collaborate with the nominal

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,010
with some other with Whalen or with

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,590
exhaust and you want to contribute a

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,840
patch they will probably need different

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,360
requirements that we do and if for

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,610
example instead of requiring to submit

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,460
patches even fabricator they may prefer

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,260
to receive patches using github or they

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,630
may prefer using mailing lists and we

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,330
have to keep that in mind in order to to

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:56,560
contribute them to collaborate with each

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,100
other okay and I will I would like to

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,800
give a small example of

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,790
that kind of contribution was happening

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,350
with plasma long-term support and with

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,290
the plasma developers and the Susa

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,410
developers in which this case I

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:16,980
represented and that's the reason I knew

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,190
this this collaboration a bit more with

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,430
more detail and I wanted to show you

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,740
what happened here last year

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,990
openSUSE leap for the 2.2 had a release

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,700
date of schedule that was happening very

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:36,540
close to the release date of plasma 80s

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:40,800
5.8 LTS this was a problem because yeah

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:44,670
we couldn't get plasma 5.8 into leap and

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,120
we at we I mean I'm not talking about we

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:50,430
I think we in openSUSE we wanted to

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,630
include the latest kv version the latest

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:56,160
plasma version so we thought the plasma

00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,370
developers and the convince developers

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,920
talked and we decided to help each other

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,250
by moving or less carriers and the

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,950
openSUSE release manager decided to to

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,980
delay the release date a few weeks and

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:14,190
the plasma developers decided to advance

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,230
a few weeks the release date so there

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,410
was time to package everything for

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,320
openSUSE this is important because a

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,740
plasma 5.8 was released on october and

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,370
just one month later we had all the

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,080
packages packaged it tested and

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,420
introduce it in the into the

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,500
distribution and in fact we not only

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:40,530
introduced it 5.8 but 5.82 which was

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,640
already available there and that was our

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:46,380
good successful successfully story and

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,080
yeah everyone I think everyone in

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:54,780
openSUSE was very very happy with that

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:57,140
and also on a continuation of that they

00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,240
open through solid 15 a schedule is

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,210
happening next year around March we

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,980
don't have a specific date yet but some

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,930
weeks ago we

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,930
one of the plasmid developer meetings

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,880
yeah we talked there about that because

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:19,650
we would like to have another question

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,350
of plasma LTS there we requested to have

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:25,050
fun LTS release available there for that

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:28,140
because in other case for for open to

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:31,680
sleep we actually needed

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,530
LTS wrist and the only LTS release ever

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,610
we had was two years old when one of the

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:42,110
15 was it's going to be released so this

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:46,340
meant that we requested to have the

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:49,800
plasma of a new plasma release and the

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,350
plasma developers delivered quite work

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,740
so I would like to thank all the plasma

00:19:52,350 --> 00:20:03,380
developers especially a Jonathan riddle

00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:03,380
Marko's sorry Marco Martin and also yeah

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:14,640
probably sleeping service because you

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,550
made it possible you will going to make

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,750
possible but we have a new calibration

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:26,460
on openSUSE leap and that's great ok so

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:31,680
as an example of collaboration between

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:34,410
communities we kv realized that we need

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,890
no no i'll change it again to say we

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:41,030
ascend weekly okay well before that

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:45,360
before that I forgot something and yeah

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:47,730
it was nothing important because don't

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,570
less with the community guy from

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:54,450
openSUSE brought me something so that we

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,030
can show that we happy with the heavy

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,710
changes that you made for us and I'm

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,370
going to throw this away and see who is

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,370
awake ok

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:19,989
okay I nearly forgot so I was talking

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:22,489
about the Kelly advice report which is

00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:25,279
which is something that can be created

00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:28,190
in order to hear from from the

00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,809
communities around us and I think that

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,239
this is very important and I think that

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,210
this has achieved a lot and I hope that

00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:38,690
it continues achieving things because

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:42,499
it's important that all all communities

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,450
here desire the communities that mostly

00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:47,349
care about Kelly and the committee's

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,940
that Carrie also want to hear from and

00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:52,700
you know that they carry every board

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,759
tries to well you know how it works

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,849
maybe I should explain a bit how it

00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:04,340
works the Caleb provides a dedicated

00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:05,899
contact person from TV so that each of

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,080
these projects that are part of the

00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:12,109
misreport have representatives that can

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,970
contact us that contact person at any

00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:15,799
point in time if they have a problem of

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,729
they have a question and in this case

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:25,570
for example it was a very David Emerson

00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:28,220
was very very helpful with that because

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,909
in my case I'm the recipe for Susie and

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,710
we talked a lot about these plasma

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:36,919
changes that we needed that at openSUSE

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,259
so I think that it has worked well at

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,649
least for for us

00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:45,109
and then we also have regular meetings

00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:49,700
the regular meetings using video

00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:51,859
conferences I don't remember the stage

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,419
of time between each of the meetings in

00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,869
something like six months if I'm not

00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:59,690
wrong but yeah something like that

00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:02,179
and in those regular meetings with all

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,599
the contact persons and representatives

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:07,279
together and we can talk together and

00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,489
communicate with in between each other

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:14,989
and there are all needs and about our

00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:16,669
requests and everything so apart from

00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:18,789
our community and the community around

00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,979
us there are also other people on

00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,829
around the world many people have done

00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:26,259
I'm not part of any community and we

00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:28,989
have to reach them and we have to get

00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:30,969
them together with us because we have a

00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:33,039
vision that is to have a world in which

00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:35,859
everyone has control over the digital

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,999
life and enjoys freedom and privacy and

00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:41,260
for that we need to reach everyone so

00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:43,000
thank you

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,860
[Applause]

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,060
[Music]

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,960
[Applause]

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,720
[Music]

00:23:45,960 --> 00:24:08,669
[Applause]

00:23:50,720 --> 00:24:11,270
if not you questions so Antonio the the

00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:13,890
picture of the Bugzilla network graph

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:17,700
there were three main centers of

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:21,240
activity and it was 2011 yes what are

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,630
the sense what are the the main points

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:29,190
there do you know the main points do you

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:31,230
mean the the black dots yes the talk the

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,080
well connected pieces in the in this

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:37,230
beautiful Caitie connector connect graph

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,020
you mean the clusters right yes yes I

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,390
don't know because I haven't made the

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,990
paper but I can tell you that I forgot

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,820
to mention that this is over a time

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,779
period of four months if I'm not wrong

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,720
this is only the the relationships

00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:57,840
between persons in a four months period

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,140
okay and you consider the number of

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,899
persons participating in in pasilla and

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,850
relationships but I'm not sure exactly

00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:08,370
which of this points represent which of

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,740
these groups represent I guess I'm not

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:14,510
sure but I guess the big one is probably

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,510
plasma but

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,720
it's him

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:28,730
maybe maybe spin yes maybe we can

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,780
contact the day offers and ask them and

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,660
they probably have they're still delayed

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,690
my question probably was the same

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:44,240
I couldn't hear his question but the

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:47,960
question is mine is if you know because

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,380
I understood that it is not your work by

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,630
the way

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,020
if you know how do they measure that I

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,250
mean how can you keep track of you know

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,810
relationships and so on

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,300
I don't know males or there is an

00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:02,810
instrument that is able to do you know

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,330
how no this is only on Box ela and I'm

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,280
not sure I don't think they have

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:14,240
internally on but this Bugzilla platform

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:15,950
so yeah sorry silly question I just in

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,340
case by the way but what he said is that

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,680
maybe it's not class now but pin like me

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:26,570
I think one of them must be Amarok I

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:29,180
reckon one the racism rock from so my

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,580
question was other other minutes from

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,560
the advisory board meetings that I have

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,590
maybe missed or can you tell me what

00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:40,220
sort of things I discussed there I'm not

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:45,200
sure but I think somebody asked a few

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,280
weeks ago about that salsa and I'm not

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,480
sure if they are available

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:53,180
I guess they should be at some point

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,660
sorry basically we discuss about the

00:26:53,180 --> 00:27:03,260
needs of all of those numbers and for

00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:05,210
example in my case I don't think I'm I I

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,300
don't think I was anything wrong if I

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,440
say that in my case I told everyone

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:15,340
about the needs of Sousa and about the

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,070
requirements for this sushi releases and

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,780
basically in my case I told them that

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,610
told everyone so that we knew that we

00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,670
can contact the plasma developers and

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:30,970
that it was working well

00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:33,430
and what kind of things yeah yeah but

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,840
for example Canonical's also there and I

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,120
think it's important that they know that

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,730
they can contact us if they need some

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,900
different candy and you know it's

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,020
important that everyone sees the

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,090
relationship between each other in your

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,630
opinion what can we do to improve the

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:52,660
relation between KD and the rest of the

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:55,890
of the distros assuming that the distros

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:59,110
have people that care about KD but

00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,970
traditionally it looks like that we

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,150
haven't done a great job about I mean we

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,450
have a success story as you mentioned

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,910
how can we replicate that to others I

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:14,140
think that's the question that everyone

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:17,080
is asking themselves I don't have a real

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,390
answer for that I mean in my case I can

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,170
talk about Suzanne in there it's

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,930
difficult to get KD into the Lee desktop

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:31,570
but for for lip it's the default desktop

00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:34,510
so the requirements so far are been

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,420
fulfilled the release manager is quite

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:40,300
happy with wizkid but with plasma as the

00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,890
main as the default desktop I don't

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,140
think there's any any plan to change

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,360
that in order to change all the

00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,070
distributions to use carry maybe we

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:54,730
should reach them and try to help them

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:56,500
create packages I don't know hey I just

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,290
want to say that for the research

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,720
questions regarding connectivity and

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:07,320
things like that you should talk to me

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,320
or Kevin because we've done that stuff

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,400
I don't me again so I saw some worrying

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:25,150
comments from one of your mailing lists

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,039
that somebody in Sousa thought that KDE

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,049
had decided their preferred distro

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,970
because they they were all going with

00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:38,890
Kitty nyan now and as the Katie neon

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:40,630
developer I I think this is a well this

00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,370
is of the nonsense and it's an important

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,230
say because Katie neon is like two or

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,940
three of us starting new projects I'm

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,120
starting with KDE Robin

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,860
Katie starting the saying oh this is the

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,169
project we're going with it's just two

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,630
or three of us starting at with KDE so I

00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:58,179
wonder if does the idea still exists

00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:02,500
within Suzy and other distros and is a

00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:03,940
problem it's it's difficult to talk

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,950
about the whole community of the whole

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,500
audience is a community I think that

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,590
person's individual persons that maybe

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:15,340
they're not fine with Kelly having a

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:17,140
special place for noon but in general I

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,580
don't think there is any problem I mean

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,179
there are some people that have

00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,860
expressed myself have told me that that

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:27,130
they have a problem with that and it

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:30,279
looks like Kelly is yeah having a

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:33,340
special place a special name for noon

00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,320
and putting it's too much I don't I

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,490
haven't seen that and I don't think it's

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:42,429
true but yeah there will be only always

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,090
persons that that think different from

00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:48,490
you and you have to take with that and

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,809
live with that but in general I don't

00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,850
think there's any problem from the

00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:53,850
openSUSE community with respect to noon

00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,360
and we talked a lot about distros but

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:06,149
your other head is president of Katies

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:11,710
hispana Katie espana is clearly a

00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:14,980
successful thing for Katie to have what

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:18,549
do you think Katie can and should do to

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:23,549
to help Katie espana more but also other

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:23,549
local groups like it well

00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:30,030
right now I mean we are generating a lot

00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,920
of events and we are going to a lot of

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,680
events in part thanks to Balthazar who

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:39,450
is quite active in that regard

00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,340
and yes so far I think that probably the

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,220
most the easiest way to collaborate with

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,140
us is economically but I don't think

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,610
that we are right now in a position that

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,380
we need economic support from so I don't

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:56,130
think there's any problem with that in

00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,220
fact what we have we are kind of making

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,620
again our numbers on the treasurer

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,510
numbers maybe in the future but so far I

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,700
mean I don't think there is any any

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:09,680
special support that we need from from

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:13,490
kediri any case thank you for the help

00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:17,940
my question is more towards development

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:22,170
for the president to ask how's the

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,870
effort of integrating KD frameworks back

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,090
into cute going and how much of KD

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:35,610
frameworks is left that's probably a

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:39,420
question for David yeah so indeed when

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,430
we had the the meeting in Ronda in 2011

00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,280
that that started the whole frameworks

00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:46,260
in fact one of the very radical ideas

00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,240
that came out at the time was let's take

00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,640
all of KD libs as it was called at the

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,280
time and put it into cute and of course

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,050
that's not exactly what happened but it

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,480
gave us a bit of a direction which was

00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,430
let's try to put into it what actually

00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,140
makes sense there and there was a large

00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,360
number of classes that appeared in cute

00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,220
because you know there is no reason for

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,990
Katy to be the only ones who can create

00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,260
temporary directories or stuff like that

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:12,660
right that's very general needs so this

00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,930
actually went into cute but everything

00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:18,090
else is you know entire technologies on

00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:21,120
top of cute and that is just too much

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,010
for to tea itself so all of that is what

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,690
created KD frameworks which is a you

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,230
know a whole set of atoms on top of cute

00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:30,240
like many other people do as well so I'm

00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,530
quite happy with the result which is we

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,480
managed to boot into cute what makes

00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:36,980
sense there and to keep the rest as a

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,980
separate set of libraries

00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,960
so we don't have any more time for

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:47,589
questions let's give a hand okay

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,589
