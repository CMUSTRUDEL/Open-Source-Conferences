Title: Antonio Larrosa - The KDE Community and Its Ecosystem - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	The KDE Community is large and diverse. It encompasses persons with different cultures and different views on many topics but still all share a common goal on the KDE project.

At the same time, the KDE community is not alone in the digital world. There are other communities around us which may have different goals but also may share some of our ideas. How can we take advantage of this? Which are those communities? How can we collaborate more with those other communities and let them collaborate with us too?
