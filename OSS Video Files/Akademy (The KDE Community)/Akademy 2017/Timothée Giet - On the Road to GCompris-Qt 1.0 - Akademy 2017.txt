Title: Timoth√©e Giet - On the Road to GCompris-Qt 1.0 - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	This talk is about the recent activity in GCompris, the issues we faced, and how the community can join us.

During the last year a lot of things happened in GCompris. We finally officially shipped the new Qt-based version instead of the old one, and people are mostly happy with it.

In this talk, I'd like to show the progress we made, and some shiny new activities. I'll also talk about the few issues that some users have been facing with the new version compared to the old one. We found workarounds for some issues, but a few are inevitable.

We are slowly getting closer to 1.0, but there is still some big work to do. I'll try to summarize the remaining tasks, and point to the parts where the community can help.
