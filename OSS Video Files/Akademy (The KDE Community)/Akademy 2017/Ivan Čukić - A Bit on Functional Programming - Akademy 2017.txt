Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Functional programming is often said to be necessary in multi-threaded environments, but that is only one part of the story. Avoiding mutation helps avoid explicit synchronization of concurrent processes, but it can also be helpful in other circumstances.

This talk will cover a selection of topics related to functional programming, and how it can improve our day-to-day work, make our code safer, cleaner and more correct.
