Title: Arnav Dhamija - An Introduction to the KIO Library - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	The KDE Input Output (KIO) library in KDE is an integral part to KDE Frameworks 5 and provides a uniform wrapper API for accessing data from a number of different protcols such as protocols for files, ssh, https, samba shares, ftp, and network file systems. Several KDE applications use the KIO library such as Dolphin and KDE Connect use this API extensively for file management operations.

My talk will be an introduction to KIO library in KDE. I will explain the need for KIO, how KIO works, KIO slaves, and how to develop for the same. I will also discuss some recent developments in the KIO world. If time permits, I will also take questions from the audience.

My talk will be an introduction to the KIO library used in several KDE Applications. I will start with a brief introduction to the uses of KIO and how it is applied in several KDE applications such as Dolphin and Plasma Plasmoids. After this, I will demonstrate some examples of the KIO abstraction layer in action using kioclient and with some KDE applications. I will also talk about how KDE applications tap into KIO's functionality to execute the same file management operation (e.g. move, copy, delete), across a number of different protocols without needing to code separately for each protocol.

Following this, I will talk about how KIO slaves complete the KIO abstraction layer and how KIO slaves can be written to accomplish a number of nifty use cases (such as my kio-stash GSoC project and the Google Drive KIO slave). I will talk briefly about how to develop a simple KIO slave using the KIO slave base classes such as SlaveBase and ForwardingSlaveBase. After this, if time permits, I will take some questions from the audience.
