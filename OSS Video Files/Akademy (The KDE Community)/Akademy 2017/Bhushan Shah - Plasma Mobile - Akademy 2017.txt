Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Plasma Mobile offer a Free (as in Freedom and beer), user-friendly, privacy-enabling and customizable platform for mobile devices. This talk aims to discuss and demonstrate the recent developments of Plasma Mobile project

In course of one year, lots of underlying stack for Plasma Mobile changed, lots of new developments happened on user-facing side of the Plasma Mobile.

We also integrated Plasma Mobile to newer Android Marshmallow based devices like Nexus 5X.

the next speaker is bhishan Shah and

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,880
he's going

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,620
mobile the most

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,050
operating system for mobile phones and

00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:29,490
the most open one so give a warm welcome

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:32,700
to Bouchon thank you again so I will

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:39,379
talk about plasma miles we introduced

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:44,250
plasma while in Academy 2015 at the

00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:47,010
Karuna and since then we have been

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:53,250
slowly slowly moving towards open mobile

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:59,970
platform so and we also finalized the

00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:02,820
reason in 2016 so that that was about

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,680
full that vision will provide a full

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,890
control over your information and

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,400
communication and it's also inclusive to

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,680
third-party software and plasma while

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,640
also aims to provide seamless cross

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,049
device experience like if you have your

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,270
mobile your mobile device can be you you

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,090
can use similar same software onto your

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,850
mobile device and you are also on your

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:36,409
desktop device so also plasma mobile

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:40,649
aims to follow the open standards so I

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:43,310
am here to talk about what's going on in

00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:47,189
class mobile project in general and

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:54,060
where are we toward towards this reason

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:58,530
V we have so for the year 2017 we have

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:01,909
had several achievements for like for

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:08,140
instance we got a first

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:11,720
and marshmallow or Android 6h deviceport

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:15,370
this basically previously all the

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,670
supported devices based on Android file

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:29,420
for example Nexus 5 and one plus one but

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:32,150
in 2017 seventeen reported it to Nexus

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,510
5x which is which comes pre-installed

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,019
with Android marshmallow and we also

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:43,430
released kirigami 2 which is a set of

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:46,099
cute quick controls 2 components which

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,819
allows you to create applications for

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,930
plasma mobile and also for the plasma

00:02:49,819 --> 00:03:00,440
desktop which are both convergent and

00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:05,870
can work on both devices seamlessly also

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:09,739
one more important one more important

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,620
project we started or joined was project

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:16,549
helium I will talk about it in next

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:19,090
slides project helium brought us some

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:24,739
more officially and unofficially

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:26,959
supported device ports so and this also

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,669
protests some potential new devices

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,130
where plasma by can be easily supported

00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:40,160
but some but we haven't tried actually

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:45,889
running a plasma bite on them so let me

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:48,590
talk about project on iam so few months

00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:53,569
ago canonical stopped developing the

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:56,870
Ubuntu touch at that time community

00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:02,450
members of Cuba force decided that they

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,849
will not they don't agree with the they

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,090
don't agree with the decision made by

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:11,720
canonical and they will continue the

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:13,260
Ubuntu touch as always and this UB ports

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,479
team decided that they

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,639
maintain the you people to touch so in

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,139
one of their initial meetings that is

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:29,760
they also thought that it's a good idea

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:32,400
that the other communities who are

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,460
working towards the same goal which is

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,389
the reusing the Android binary blocks on

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,660
your on on the mobile devices we should

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:46,110
collaborate with them for such

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,949
communities where shelf issue is selfish

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,070
ways and more plasma ball in a mobile

00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:57,389
you know ace and as such communities

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,729
this idea was present a truck then I

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,479
discussed this idea with Maya scripts

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:06,720
card and we decided that we should do

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,840
something like this together we

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,570
initially started it with a Google

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,580
document and a telegram group in a

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:20,700
Google document people people documented

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,110
with various ideas on which factors we

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,750
should collaborate with and and which

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,169
parts should be unified between this

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:36,690
different projects this Google document

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:41,400
was of 11 to 12 pages long and we kept

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:44,610
refining those ideas flow every day and

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,240
we also had a telegram group to Harlem

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:52,830
where we discussed those ideas everyone

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,930
came and gave their new ideas and there

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,840
were several projects members from

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,520
several projects coming and giving us

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,349
feedback on their ideas

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,160
after that we started we decided that

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:10,710
people to use Nexus 5 as a reference

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,039
device and which helped something

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,460
working so project volume and aims to

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,890
provide a common

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:24,480
common android-based which you can use

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:29,280
which you can use to reuse the android

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,680
drivers and Android binary blobs so we

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,930
started with the Nexus 5 as a reference

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,030
root filesystem at reference device and

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,300
we we had a reference root filesystem

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,240
which allowed us to run various stage

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,900
the which can make sure that device

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,240
functions properly and we are we can

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,070
reuse of all the Android binary blobs

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:57,450
and after that I also ported plasma

00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:01,350
mobile to use the same hollien base we

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:05,940
and later on we also started working on

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:08,340
Halim 7.1 which I which I believe

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,150
currently just selfish ways and Harlem

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:15,120
community are the only one suite which

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,510
are working on Android seven base port

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:24,210
so Android seventh base port allows us

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:28,230
to allows us to D now allows us to have

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:32,360
a open mobile open mobile operating

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:35,520
systems on the really new devices but

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,960
progressing such projects had to rely on

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:43,880
older devices but with under seven based

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,100
port this is not this is not understand

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,630
baseball Android seven based port where

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:55,800
this is not reality anymore so this is

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:59,580
the picture of plasma mobile running on

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,170
on Nexus 5 or you peapods

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,240
touch 1604 or running on the Nexus 5 and

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,240
trans Mobile on Sat phone to or using

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,030
same alien base

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,600
so important bit about this is that

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,610
device you see over that flat phone - no

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,670
one from Kady community had to actually

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,890
poor to the cell phone to the big

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:28,260
because harlem base was already working

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,980
that we can judge tree just put our root

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,280
filesystem

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,729
on

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:39,630
top of the Hylian based and we caught it

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:43,200
working it just worked so this allowed

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:46,860
us some new devices for example Nexus 5

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,970
Nexus 5 X 1 plus 1 flat phone - and

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,220
Nexus 7 2013 GSM what idea this other

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,220
devices - on which plasma overlays

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,950
actually paste it there are other some

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,480
community ports but those are not

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:07,170
functional yet and this also allows us

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:14,220
to some potential new devices for

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:17,400
example for example 1 + 2 3 X + 5 we put

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,839
that code names also Nexus 6 and Nexus 6

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:26,490
v 6 P and there are many more other

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:29,339
devices but on which community is

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:33,839
working to port and have Halim running

00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,510
on on those devices so there are too

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,280
many devices so hi Liam community is

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:45,000
actively working on porting those

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:47,550
devices so so far I talked about

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,970
everything cooked every good things that

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:56,610
have happened about plasma movement but

00:09:50,970 --> 00:10:01,440
the question is that is not everything

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:05,730
that is a good there are several points

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:09,500
where plasma wellnitz so and its

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:13,920
improvement the one part is quality and

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:17,190
testings so so far it said we had a

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,500
really look we we had a two or three

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:25,170
devices supported by the plasma mobile

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:27,720
so people who had no no specific people

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,100
here without the specific devices we're

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:36,000
not able to teach that those and as a

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,530
result we had no no such book reports or

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,120
no such testing or Quality Assurance

00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:45,750
processes so this is the place

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,240
but we need a needed improvement and it

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,150
also will need a help

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,029
we will also also currently there are

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,790
two less applications supported by the

00:10:54,029 --> 00:11:00,960
plasma mobile in theory plasma mobile is

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,779
adjusted gnu/linux system so you can run

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,420
any gnu/linux application on your plasma

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,820
over but still we are missing that touch

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:13,400
optimized the applications which can

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,400
work nicely on the mobile devices

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:20,160
another problem is 9 powered partly this

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,070
issue is solved by project hollien that

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,850
we offloaded the work of porting 2

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:30,180
devices to putting devices to helium

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,029
project and so we can focus on the

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:38,640
actual user interface and improvements

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:40,710
on plasma side there are also other

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,000
external effect factors affecting the

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:50,040
blood plasma my projects the Android

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
devices or the devices have really old

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,860
version of kernels so and the really old

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,970
version of kernel is a security

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:04,560
nightmare because no one makes sure that

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:09,660
the make sure that those devices have a

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:13,500
security fixes big backported and also

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:16,620
the devices are getting harder to hard

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,140
hard and hard to think of some devices

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,320
have a totally locked bootloader which

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,420
you cannot really unlock and so you are

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,050
stuck with whatever is provided by the

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,050
back vendor also entered have started

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,050
doing forced encryption on system and

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:40,260
data partition which you cannot work

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:43,740
work around easily so these are the

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,260
issues and also for example now this

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,450
devices even if we they have open-source

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,660
kernel they require a closed source

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,870
support support what support files

00:12:51,660 --> 00:13:00,510
through function

00:12:52,870 --> 00:13:03,970
for full extent and those prove source

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:07,720
cool source blackboard support project

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,700
is basically you it's a basically walled

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,290
garden you don't really know what's

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:17,260
happening inside and for example more in

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,300
front that is a open is the operating

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,850
system in itself you don't really know

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,890
what it's doing when you actually call

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,770
is it recording your data is it

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:29,920
recording your metadata you don't really

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:35,920
know and there is a no way to reverse

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:40,150
engineer those easily so is everything

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,930
about external factors wrong I'd say no

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:47,200
there are some quote external factors

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,870
affecting the plasma mult project for

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,779
example there is a new project called

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:57,910
proof market voice push market oasis

00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,630
fish market always have a cool which is

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:05,140
aiming for 10 year life cycle for

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:08,470
smartphone push market away this project

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,620
was started by oliver switched it aims

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,110
for 10 year life cycle of the phones it

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,200
uses alpine linux as a minimal base

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,930
because our binding axes of famers to be

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,850
used on embedded devices because it's a

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:26,339
really small you can have a base

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:29,589
installation as small as 6 to 7 m bees

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,920
if so using western as a reference you

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:36,100
user interface and it wants to use a

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:41,920
class mountain while as a estep user

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:45,360
interface just before yesterday part

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,980
rivers with nick known as pure try out

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,529
package the plasma while on the post

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,200
market was which is a really great work

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:57,339
he basically started when we started

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,740
when i started my academic travel and he

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,410
have finished to build all the KD

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,710
frameworks plasma and trans mobile

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:10,530
components in a just a few days

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:13,110
which is really great but it is they

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:17,960
haven't actually tried to do run it but

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:21,150
it's a packaging is a really huge one

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,180
also there are projects to have open

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:28,290
devices for example open devices program

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:31,260
by SUNY that they aim to have a closed

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,040
source both support pro one support

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:38,010
parts the main like into mainline kernel

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,670
SUNY is also Sonia is also working on

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:47,070
effort to support devices with mainline

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:49,140
kernel for also qualcomm is working on

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,660
having a mainline kernel working on

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,550
their devices there are few devices

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:58,290
which already supports my mainline

00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:03,390
kernel and also fairphone is one of the

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:06,750
open devices which is some which which

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,240
is open as open as it can be in both

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,240
hardware and software terms and there

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,300
are also rumors that purism is launching

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,700
a linux phone which will be open in

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:24,720
depth open we don't really know it's

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:28,320
just a rumor at this point so the sense

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,420
of is a conclusion so journey towards

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,050
open mobile platform is in this is

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,040
actually hard yeah but we are not the

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,250
only same only ones on the same path

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,400
there is a community like Cuba pours

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,260
shellfish way smaller Nemo boiled and we

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,960
should work we as a community should

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:54,060
work together to have a open mobile

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,160
platform and yes that that's the

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,180
conclusion of my talk if you have any

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,180
questions let me know

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:08,130
[Applause]

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:22,340
so members of which other projects are

00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:27,140
currently in helium currently you be

00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:31,670
ports Nemo while plasma mobile extra do

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:34,310
is sand that is also independent project

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,920
called gnu/linux support those

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:45,650
developers are part of the Hylian

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:50,510
project and also people from shellfish

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:52,220
whose community are present there is it

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:57,830
possible to install cousin mobile on

00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:01,820
yellow phone depends Jolla phone doesn't

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,640
actually have ender - I'm not really

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,940
sure that Jolla phone have android parts

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,480
open source it's a problem with it's a

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,640
similar problem as official Ubuntu touch

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,250
devices well they don't have actually

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,120
Android parts open source they have just

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:23,330
have a kernel open source so it's if

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,130
someone manages to port like let's say a

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,860
lineage OS for signers and more to those

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:32,570
devices it should be possible in theory

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:35,140
but we don't really know either

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,140
questions

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,900
yes um I was wondering what is currently

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:51,350
working on the reference device for

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:56,840
example the Nexus 5x does a phone stack

00:18:51,350 --> 00:19:00,290
work message is the Camejo currently we

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,410
have basic functions working for example

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:06,650
it's not Nexus 5x let's try it

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:10,340
and because Nexus 5x port is really just

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:13,330
of week or two weeks old but because we

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,270
migrated to end of seven based ports so

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:22,400
for Nexus 5 we currently have audio

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:25,720
calls and Wi-Fi and basic functions

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,380
working but it's not as polished as

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,380
users might expect

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:55,720
so about the manpower bit you mentioned

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:58,180
before it's clear or seems to be clear

00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,050
that like the manpower we have is very

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,350
busy at the moment

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,030
so we should try to get me my manpower

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,880
how do we do how do you think we can

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,710
keep having mobile phones is things like

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,140
people are excited about mobile phones

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,440
so yeah hope it seems it shouldn't be

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,380
that hard getting new people but it

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:23,200
seems it is so do we have a plan to try

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:25,740
to bring new people in so I can tell you

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,400
how to get involved into plus boom one

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,980
so for plasma ball porting your work is

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,320
now offloaded to Harlem projects so if

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,460
you want to put it to your devices then

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,700
it's the project column to where you

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:47,170
should go if you want to help in

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,990
packaging Cosmo coils and and we have

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,650
kept the packaging out of the carry out

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,710
of the carry bit repository for obvious

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,930
reasons because we don't want to limit

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,930
our limit the distributions that kind

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,910
package plus mobile so if you want to

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:08,080
package a plasma while there is a plasma

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:10,600
foam packaging github repository if you

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,420
want to work on actual shells then there

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,390
is a plasma form components repository

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:20,530
on carry get where you can improve and

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,960
work on shell that cell package is also

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,540
functional on the let's say desktop so

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,850
you can run it in embed it more on the

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,820
desktop and have to easily do

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:34,960
development easily if you want to work

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,530
on HW composer backend and have the

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:43,420
device has the hardware parts working

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:45,220
then you can you traffic's and hardware

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,760
parts if you want to get them working

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,130
then the Queen Wayland and queen valina

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,860
and other plasma rapid repositories are

00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,730
also part so basically if you want to

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,440
contribute

00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,430
if you want but are contributing to

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,500
plasma than you are also contributing to

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,990
plasma mobile if you have applications

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,510
that application that is working on

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,660
plasma desktop and you if you want to

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,360
run it on cross or mobile then it's also

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:18,440
easier with that you're going to also

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,170
try it on your device or maybe on your

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,550
test off with it with a different form

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:27,350
factor switch it will also help if we

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,350
can get to some base applications

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:33,260
working so basically if you if you think

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,440
you can help with anything of our tasks

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:44,210
then I have a fabricator board where I

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:47,570
document the stars and and - and the

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:51,080
plasma and you can ask us in plasma

00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,430
table or plasma IRC channel now one of

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,220
the things that you could do is if

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:58,910
you're developing a new application or

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,010
rewriting the UI of an application take

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,500
into account to have it work on on

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:07,370
mobile one of the things that is really

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,020
easy is to use the kirigami framework

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,620
which already gives you most of the

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,050
tools by default it makes it completely

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,950
effortless to get at least the the

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,430
navigational bits working on different

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,580
screen sizes and different input methods

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,870
and if you use that as a base it is

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,690
actually pretty easy to have

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:31,700
applications not just work on the

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,060
desktop use cases if that's your primary

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:39,430
goal but to kind of port or have them

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,430
work on on plasma mobile as well

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:54,920
thank you wait you're here to clap again

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:58,850
okay well this is not technically a

00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,980
question but nobody but I am but where I

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,080
eat is a comment so based it on my

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,680
experience so it is on various Android

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,540
phones well the device system where the

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,790
device is where you have presented on

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,930
the supported ones I'm not mostly basing

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:16,610
on the core competence it tips and which

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,320
has quite a similar pilot quite a

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,930
similar structure like crab and crab

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,660
cakes and communication modern and CPU

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,460
cores and so on but if you want to if

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,710
you want to reach them more more and

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,140
more Android devices like the device is

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,810
using Samsung chips or Miata Koha way

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,190
and so on then you might it then you

00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,320
might find a find that there are

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:39,800
mysterious hardware box or mysterious

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,230
GPO box which might not be in which

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,660
might not be abstracted by the Hylian

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,430
project and which which might even need

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,310
to be there dealt by the plasma mobile

00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,770
itself from what from what I what I am

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:54,680
understanding currently as far as I know

00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:57,830
the Cayman has has various workarounds

00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:01,220
for the various reviews like Nvidia or a

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,840
or AMD and so on and if you are at and

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,360
trying and trying to expanding the

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,330
support own that is known for condemn

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,250
Isis then you might need to think about

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:17,720
about walk-arounds power persecutors or

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:19,780
Android devices and so on yes so one of

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,910
the things which number one was

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,100
yesterday someone managed to get basic

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,280
graphics working on first cells and

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:32,870
devices on the in the Hylian project

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,470
channel also qualcomm devices don't

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,680
really make it easy if you go for not

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:43,420
long nexus devices basically there is a

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,420
I can show you code actually

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,420
occasionally

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,130
[Music]

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:48,460
so here's a crazy code for example some

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,360
qualcomm devices

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:58,059
despite leap hardware being open api

00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:02,559
which which you should not break some

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:08,320
qualcomm tech devices decides that they

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:10,870
should add this no value and modify the

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,530
existing structure of the code so those

00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:16,660
two verses break the ABI of the ABI of

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,179
the everything for example green Wayland

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,190
or leap high-risk so you have to have

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,890
different root filesystem for those

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:27,100
devices so this is this is the one of

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,950
the packaging problems which I am

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,080
currently stumbling upon to solve so

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,780
basically every device wants to be

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,169
special so this is also yes this is also

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:47,169
one of the major issue in the according

00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:49,210
to this mobile devices for A+ for mobile

00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:53,640
have you already thought about other

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:58,960
form factors like running it on 10-inch

00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:03,610
tablets is it packaged for x86

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,900
compatible stops we don't have currently

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:10,290
actually yes we do have some ISO files

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,780
for running it on basically you can just

00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:17,080
use it it has a live CD on your desktop

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,960
as well so yes we do have a MD 64

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,260
packages but we also need 32-bit

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,140
packages because some devices have just

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:29,309
32-bit supported support for on this

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,309
devices so yeah

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,630
so to recap services comment appeals

00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,880
kirigami framework in real work on

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:49,610
mobile phones tablets and desktop

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:55,640
because you don't have a mic any more

00:28:49,610 --> 00:29:01,260
questions if not let's give a hand

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:04,349
[Applause]

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,349
[Music]

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:23,120
so we have a plasma ball for on 24th

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:25,070
July at 11:30 a.m. and it's in room 2.3

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,470
so if you have any ideas or wants to

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,980
discuss about class mobile then feel

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,980
