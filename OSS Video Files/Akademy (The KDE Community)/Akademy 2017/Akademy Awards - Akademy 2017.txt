00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:33,410
exciting part are you sure well can the

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,820
last year oh well I don't have slides

00:00:33,410 --> 00:01:05,100

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:13,350
application award we discussed it at

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,049
length and is that worth is going to go

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,900
for two plasma and we wanted to make a

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,270
special mention to Caillou va's work for

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,030
pushing plasma boundaries every day and

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,780
he is dedicated to the project Caillou

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:38,269

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:38,269
[Applause]

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,560
yeah and the next thing we want to do is

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,780
there are a lot of people that did a lot

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,450
of things in the past especially in DAV

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,630
which wasn't that publicly noticed by

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,400
everybody and therefore we proposed for

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,190
the non complication confusion of vodka

00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,080
near Omaha which did a great job in the

00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,270
past as president TV for a lot of years

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,110
and a lot of other things at Sousa and

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:12,650
later openSUSE and yeah clap a bit

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:16,580
unfortunately to appear so the last word

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:20,780
is Julia Ward and usually it's also an

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:23,300
award to yeah people who not maybe not

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,410
directly working on applications or so

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:31,240
and in fact we were discussing this also

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:34,760
a lot in this year this year's a award

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,519
goes to Martin coronoid and Olaf Schmidt

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:45,820
receiver for the work on the KDF acute

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:49,310
foundation and maybe maybe maybe maybe

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,500
just one additional word about this

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,180
because KD if recued foundation maybe

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,530
not everyone knows about this is an

00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,650
entity that is set up between cute so

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,930
cute software company and M KDE and it

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,890
more or less allow us or we agree

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:09,890
together about the licensing terms for

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,830
the cute releases and to get the best

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,049
out of the well cute for the free

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,980
software community but also for a cute

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:20,720
offer company for their products so this

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,380
is really important because image and

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,660
enjoys that M cute is also free for us

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,370
in the years to come and that's actually

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:34,690
why we thought this might be a very good

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:37,400
idea but this wasn't the last award

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,549
because we were here because they were

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,770
here before organizing Academy it was

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,900
it's a lot of work every year so it's

00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,940
Millea Rubin and all of the local team

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,340

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,340
but you always also get an award

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:36,110

what most I love of your job as I said

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,650
was think they didn't like it because I

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,419

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:24,139
