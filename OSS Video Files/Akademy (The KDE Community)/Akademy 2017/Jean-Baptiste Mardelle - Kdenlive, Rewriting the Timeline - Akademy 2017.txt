Title: Jean-Baptiste Mardelle - Kdenlive, Rewriting the Timeline - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	In 2017, we started a rewrite of some core parts of the Kdenlive video editor. This presentations will be an opportunity to get some details on the process and see a demonstration of the upcoming Kdenlive 17.08.

The most visible change that will happen for Kdenlive 17.08 is a switch to QML for many parts of the UI. The timeline, where most interaction happens, now benefits from a more polished look, with enhanced user interaction that will be demonstrated during the presentation. This will also be an opportunity to present the huge work that was done recently to improve the stability and maintainability of the code.

okay so I'm ready to start so I'm Jon

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,330
batiste Medel I'm the maintainer of

00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:25,470
kdenlive the video editing application

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:30,149
using the KDE environment and my talk is

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,439
about rewriting the timeline so first

00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,739
time I'm going to give you some

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:40,170
background information on why we had to

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:50,340
rewrite the timeline and what we what we

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:53,910
did this year in 2017 so the Akkadian

00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:01,260
life project started around 2005 and

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:04,189
this was the first kd3 release so it was

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:11,100
a very basic application at that time

00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:21,829
then in 2008 was the first KD port so we

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:25,200
switch to the KD for libraries in 2010

00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:28,880
new new contributors came in before it

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,209
was mostly mostly me and we added new

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:38,880
new features like stop-motion widget

00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:49,139
color scopes and and many new features

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:52,979
came in at that year then in 2011 we

00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:55,139
came closer to the KD community I went

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,990
to the first to my first random eating

00:01:55,139 --> 00:02:00,689
well KD developers meet and we switch

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:06,090
the code from SourceForge tool to the

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:09,750
KDE servers in 2007 there was a first

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,260
rewrite attempt because as you can see

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,040
on the image the code was just piling up

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,430
and becoming a bit difficult to manage

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,430
in

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:28,280
2013 the project had a big growth so it

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:38,200
became more and more complex to to

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:40,810
manage in 2014

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,849
there was a first discussions about

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,950
rewriting part of the fkd in LA because

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:50,780
it became so complex that it was hard to

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:59,810
to manage on that same year we started

00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:01,599
to port 2 KD frameworks 5 in 2015 will

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:07,329
release for the first

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:13,720
kkd frameworks 5 version we also had a

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:16,519
first UI review with a KD vdg group and

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,950
we started and was a very important

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,540
thing for the community the kdenlive

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:27,769
cafe so we started in December 2015 a

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:30,709
monthly cafe IRC cafee were users on

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:39,139
developers MIT and ever since that every

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:44,209
month we have had this discussion so

00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:46,730
that was a 2015 2016 we focused on the

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:50,870
community we had some new people coming

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:55,519
in with redesigned the website and we

00:03:50,870 --> 00:04:02,299
tried to also to refocus on our target

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:04,510
user group sorry to have because we we

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,680
wanted to make carrying life useful for

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,560
professional or semi-professional video

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,200
details so we tried to refocus on decent

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,299
to really try to listen to our target

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,780
users to improve the application and

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:21,590
also in the in the years before we added

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:24,250
lots of stuff kind of we were trying to

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:28,250
do everything in one application so we

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,360
in 2016 were he focused to try to do

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:38,699
video editing only but try to do it

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:40,990
good and so in 2017

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,349
almost five years after thinking about

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:49,080
writing large parts of cave in life we

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:49,080
finally started this big big high right

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:59,349
okay because it became obvious that if

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,370
we wanted to add new features to - also

00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:05,500
- to make advanced features usable for

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,389
professional editors it was impossible

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,310
to continue like this adding new

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,509
features only meant that we added new

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,509
bugs and it was unfixable

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:39,490
so the first refactoring attempt in 2014

00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:43,150
was mostly unsuccessful because we tried

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:46,180
to revolt separate code and it was later

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,580
we realized it was almost impossible to

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:54,669
learn to merge the refactoring so in

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,289
2017 we had the big chance of having a

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,490
new developer who stepped in who is

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:02,710
really who is interested in code our

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:06,430
architecture so he did a lot of code

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:10,060
cleanup and completely redesigned the

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,789
architecture to make it better so if we

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,360
have a quick look at before the

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,620
refactoring I'm going to show you so the

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,229
circles show you the files that

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,900
constitute Kadeem life timeline so we

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,000
had a custom track view class depending

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,219
on another class or another class and it

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,690
was all a big big mix so it was very

00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,940
hard to change something without

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,770
breaking other parts and also in yellow

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:41,589
you have the UI parts on in blue the

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,620
library parts and you can see that it

00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:47,620
was very mixed up so it was very

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:52,180
problematic to make a change and this

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:55,449
was a time man and there is also the

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,930
project bin the effect stack and the

00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:02,350
monitor stuff on all that was completely

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,169
mixed up so we were really blocked and

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,600
for a long time we postponed this

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:12,490
disregards because it was really not fun

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,320
thing to do so now in as of today the

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,449
timeline looks a bit like this so it's

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,940
rather simplified but you can see that

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:23,500
there are much less interdependencies

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:27,190
and UI code in in yellow is is much

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:33,910
nicely separated from the from the other

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:35,949
parts of the code so for this

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,320
refactoring first thing was that we

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:41,740
redesigned the architecture and also we

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,370
switched the code responsible for that

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,740
that came in life timeline to QML so

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,580
this also helped us as we switch to a

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,940
model view structure this also helped us

00:07:51,580 --> 00:08:02,349
to to better separate parts of the of

00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:05,620
the code so then you can see a quick

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,740
comparison of what it was in January and

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,250
what it is in July so it was a it's it's

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:21,430
simplified that it was really huge work

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:25,660
that we did we did so now in this switch

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:28,150
to qml I'm going to show you we switched

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,270
several parts of the UI but not the

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,330
whole application so currently kdenlive

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,159
it's a mixed application we have parts

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:41,080
with QA jets and parts with whis q'l

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,290
mostly because it's as it's a quite

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,580
complex application I don't think it

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,830
would be completely feasible feasible to

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,380
to completely switch to channel so

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:57,010
currently we are with we're doing what

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,630
we think is best for the

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,080
so you see in highlighted in your head a

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:07,100
surpass that now use qml so the effect

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,680
list is using QL the monitor of you is

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:18,520
also using a key ml overlay on now the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:20,270
timeline is a composed of qml okay now

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,430
I'm going to show you a quick

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,580
demonstration video demonstration of the

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,610
timeline in inaction oh sorry just

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,850
before one of the advantage of switching

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,310
to qml is that the display code for the

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,800
timeline is completely separated in some

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,830
qml files if some of you have already

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,360
used it so it's kind of JavaScript you

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,090
can easily customize the look of the

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,910
timeline so just by editing a few lines

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:50,780
of the UI you can have a completely

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:54,110
different look this is just what I I did

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:57,020
yesterday night in a in a few in my

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,810
spare time to test but it also means

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:04,730
that in some future we might be able to

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:12,080
to move to for example touch UI or

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:13,760
things like this okay and after this I'm

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,180
going to show you a quick video

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,450
demonstration of the the timeline so

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,910
this is a new version using QML so

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,960
basically for those of you who have used

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,570
kdenlive

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:32,780
you won't notice much changes so this

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:37,190
was the first one of the first goal was

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:40,010
to try to get same same features in in

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,380
the new in the new code so you will see

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:45,490
I will highlight you a few of the

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:49,970
changes but it's not completely

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:52,900
different now that we're reaching an

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:57,650
almost stable status we also want to

00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:04,250
involve users in in parts of changing

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:07,730
the UI to improve the workflow ok so you

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,420
can drag a clip in the timeline as it

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,459
was as it was before

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:18,249
you can resize a clip and you can see on

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:23,290
the right side side there's a small info

00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:27,490
displaying the length of the size change

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:32,079
so QL allows us to to add more

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:37,970
interactive cues to the to the timeline

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:43,040
you can mute a hide video or lock lock

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,800
the tracks all of this was possible

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,660
before but now the the look is a bit

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,879
nicer on you have some feedback if you

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:58,999
try to click on lock track so lock icon

00:11:49,879 --> 00:12:00,860
also pulses one of the new feature also

00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:04,009
is that you can resize tracks which was

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:08,779
not possible before in the cue graphics

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:14,360
view interface and you can compact or

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:19,040
expand the video tracks and last is the

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,129
video fades that can be adjusted it's

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,339
quite similar to what it was before but

00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:33,290
it will allow us to to have a better

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:36,259
customization of the UI okay so okay now

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,720
one of the problem we've been having in

00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,819
killing I've seen other applications is

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,199
that we depend on a lot of libraries

00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:49,550
that are usually not easily available on

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:54,079
these trolls or they have some some

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:57,110
older persons so we really we're trying

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,559
to use I heard it in several Talk's

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,639
today already to switch to them

00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:09,009
containerized formats like app image and

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:13,850
we're currently setting setting up KDE

00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:15,470
see I instance to be to build up images

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,519
of kdenlive of the development version

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:21,470
so that users can then get nightly

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,410
Buell's of the

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:28,220
of the last version as an app image to

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:32,199
easily test the latest changes so

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:36,470
hopefully this is a PhD I should be

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:40,310
working in about two or three or three

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,889
weeks so we hope we have many users that

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:46,220
follow closely the development of Korean

00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:49,519
life so it will allow them to to improve

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:55,639
testing and have us so that we can have

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:57,620
some better feedback and in September

00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,899
and also going to attend the Honda and

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,839
I'm hoping to push also for the

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:06,170
flat-pack and snapper formats so now

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,259
what what this refactoring will imply

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:16,360
for users one of the most important

00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:20,350
things that user want is stability so

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,879
one part of the code artistic

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:28,880
architectural change is that we

00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:30,470
separated the libraries of UI and Nicola

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,680
Korean who is working on this

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:38,620
refactoring added some tests and also

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:41,569
use some facing so that we can make sure

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,889
better than before that there are no

00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:49,130
regulations in the code so it should be

00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:50,839
it's one of the one of the motivation

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,380
for this charactering was to get an

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,380
improved stability

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:06,920
then one one thing that that we wanted

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,240
to achieve is advanced video editing as

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,500
I mentioned our target user group is a

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,339
professional or semi-professional video

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:19,300
editors and for this you need some

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,950
advanced editing functions a bit like

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,459
what you have in text editors like

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,160
overwrite mode or things like this so I

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,410
just illustrate of the a few of the

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,459
features that we plan to introduce that

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:39,019
was partly added before in kdenlive it

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:42,740
was so buggy because of the structure of

00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:45,470
the code so for example if you have a

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:50,660
video of a cat and want to add chicken

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:54,019
in between with that once editing you

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:57,860
can just move the clip over the other

00:15:54,019 --> 00:16:00,860
video and it will just work you don't

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:10,399
have to cut the start cut the end delete

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:13,279
understand add it ok one other thing if

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,459
you have a clip that is a big - too long

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,760
you want to cut a part you don't have to

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:27,100
also set start select the end and cut

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:27,100
you can just in one shortcut resize it

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,930
we also working on the transition

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,279
workflow currently currently in Kitty

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,500
now if you want to make a transition

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,450
between two Clips you have to put one

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,089
clip on top of the other

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:45,949
then add the transition and then the

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:49,399
transition will take place in the in the

00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:51,589
new workflow it's called a feature

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,620
called same track transition that most

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:59,269
many professional editors have you just

00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:02,060
overlap the two the two clips and the

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,170
transition will take place on the

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,459
availab

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:11,300
overlap length so the these features are

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,789
really necessary for some a professional

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,220
video editors

00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:18,740
we also planning to work on the effects

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,110
workflow currently if you want to add a

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,899
clip an effect to a clip in kdenlive you

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,809
have to search the effect list find the

00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:29,629
effect you want and then drag the effect

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:33,139
on the clip then you have the effects

00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:36,529
actual showing up and you can adjust the

00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:38,690
effect so it it requires quite a lot of

00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:42,610
steps especially because we have lots of

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,350
effects in killing life so in the new

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,389
version that we are building you will

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,869
have a built-in effects touch with the

00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:53,179
most popular venues options like

00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:55,730
contrast or color balance and you can

00:17:53,179 --> 00:18:04,220
directly adjust it without having to

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:08,450
search in in in an ethicist and I think

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:11,899
last feature I want to show is sequence

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:15,200
nesting so if you have if you have a

00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:17,419
sequence of several clips that you want

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,149
to use on you you like you can kind of

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:26,230
compact it to make it one clip and then

00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:30,470
you can add effects to this cut it

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,999
resize it and then expand it again so

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:41,869
kind of useful feature

00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:44,299
so since as I mentioned since about two

00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:48,049
years we also really refocused on the

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:49,940
community we have this monthly giving

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,350
live cafes where we discussed the

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,350
features that we are implementing

00:18:53,590 --> 00:19:01,179
because it life is also made by a lot of

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,649
people there is a Massimo who is a

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,809
professional editor who is giving us

00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:08,389
feedback on how to implement features

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:11,990
how they work in other video editing

00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:16,149
software's and how we can implement it

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:21,500
in our own way we have a farad who is

00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:23,840
who did last year a new logo new website

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,490
and we is managing communication so we

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,800
are trying also to

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:32,240
to improve our communication to the

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,630
media's and to the our users and we have

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:50,660
also Harold has been doing some great

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:52,700
tutorials in in Katy in life so one more

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:59,330
thing about this refactoring is just we

00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:02,330
plan to release it as kdn live 1712

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,809
so in December this year so with the

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:08,090
introduction of this the apimage

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:11,960
automation we have - we hope to have a

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:16,520
good testing period between September

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:25,250
and December - to debug and only improve

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:28,240
the application ok so I I think I I said

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,750
most of the things I had to I wanted to

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:36,890
to put in this presentation I don't know

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:41,070
if any of you have questions or you can

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:47,649
otherwise always come come by me later

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:51,019
[Applause]

00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:53,960
can you mention a few things that giving

00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:57,500
life is planning to implement one year

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,649
down the line in 2008 18 is the next

00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,980
year so what's going mm anything going

00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:07,610
to look like for killing life okay yeah

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:11,480
so for a longer time I think some of the

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:15,320
features I showed in in the presentation

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:20,600
maybe won't make it for the end of year

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:24,289
release so for example I think nested

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:28,340
sequences probably won't make it will be

00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:30,940
from next year otherwise features that

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,659
have been requested that we plan to

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,710
implement later

00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:40,909
for example improve the audio workflow

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:48,019
with audio mixer tool to allow better

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:52,549
adjusting of audio well we have a very

00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:54,769
long list of wanted features it and

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:58,779
maybe it pushes because I we started

00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:04,090
over factoring in in January and first I

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:06,919
thought we would make it for caving live

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:11,059
1708 so I thought we would be ready in

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,100
August and we realized it would be

00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,649
impossible so it always takes a bit

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:19,730
longer than we than we think also it

00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:22,870
will depend on if you knew developers

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,870
that you know or not

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:31,909
yeah most one of the thing we wanted

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:34,940
also to have another you I have you to

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:42,549
adjust the workflow so DTV it really

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:42,549
fits our users needs any more questions

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,250
I'm sorry

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,040
hello

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,020
well then on what what is really a

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,310
flagship application of KD and I think

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,920
should get a lot more coverage than it

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,660
does I have some silly questions one of

00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,170
which is where the tutorials that you

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,030
mentioned one is why the dark theme

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,790
why do artists somehow would like to

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,200
have everything black and another one is

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,890
why the silly name or what does that

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,540
what does the name mean okay so for the

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,120
dark team

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,870
it was a very frequent request one from

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,480
users it appeals that most video editors

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:32,290
most most photo editors use dark teams

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,860
to to work on image because it that way

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:39,070
the interface gets less in the way of

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,640
the image so it was a very much

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,890
requested feature but this can be it's

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,370
configurable so you can switch back to

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:51,610
the default desktop team if you want and

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:54,850
for the silly name question I'm not

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:57,480
responsible for it because I I started

00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:02,690
when I started you can to get imply

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:06,259
implied so name was already given

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:08,210
so I don't really know the the the

00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:10,909
origin of this of this name but I know

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,940
it's really hard to pronounce at least

00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:17,809
in French people already never know how

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:20,210
to pronounce it and now I yeah we have

00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:26,389
the website on all so it's a bit

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:29,139
complicated to change the name now the

00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:29,139
tutorials Oh

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:35,269
on the website you have a toolbox

00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:47,479
section sorry the toolbox section where

00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:52,399
you can find the tutorials are you aware

00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:55,759
that on open soos a tumbleweed cutting

00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:59,869
life isn't working at the moment no I

00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:02,479
have not followed the perfect with some

00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:05,119
new libraries that have been installed

00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:05,899
with Katy like that and it's not working

00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,599
at all

00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:10,669
it doesn't work at all no from the

00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:15,139
official repository from the fusion of

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:17,989
Austria no I was not aware of it so yeah

00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:20,330
we try we hoping to push this continue

00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:23,629
rised formats too so that at least users

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,820
can test if there is a way to make it

00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:30,889
work on the system and then go back to

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:33,259
the distribution to tell them that they

00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:40,249
should be working so I think it's the

00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:43,879
best we can do is to life those no I I

00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:47,479
understand there so I think yeah it has

00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:51,099
to be communicated to the cement package

00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:53,899
maintainer so I we don't really have a I

00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:56,720
just one last question it's about the

00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:59,269
time it took for the complex

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,729
simplification of the model how many

00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:03,710
people were involved in this because it

00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:05,869
looks very it started from very complex

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,759
model and then you came up with a very

00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:10,639
simple model it looks very nice it's a

00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:14,499
great effort yes so how many people

00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:14,499
worked on it it was a

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,400
sometimes surprising because we were

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,770
only very few people so we had made

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,400
mostly two people mostly Nicola kya

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:30,030
who's done the architectural overhaul

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,000
and I helped him to work on it so it was

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:38,070
very very intense work for several

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,030
months I hope there are no more

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:46,849
questions thanks John Baptist

00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,849
