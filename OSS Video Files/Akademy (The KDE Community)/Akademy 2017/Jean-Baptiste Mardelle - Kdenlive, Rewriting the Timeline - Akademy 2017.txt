Title: Jean-Baptiste Mardelle - Kdenlive, Rewriting the Timeline - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	In 2017, we started a rewrite of some core parts of the Kdenlive video editor. This presentations will be an opportunity to get some details on the process and see a demonstration of the upcoming Kdenlive 17.08.

The most visible change that will happen for Kdenlive 17.08 is a switch to QML for many parts of the UI. The timeline, where most interaction happens, now benefits from a more polished look, with enhanced user interaction that will be demonstrated during the presentation. This will also be an opportunity to present the huge work that was done recently to improve the stability and maintainability of the code.
