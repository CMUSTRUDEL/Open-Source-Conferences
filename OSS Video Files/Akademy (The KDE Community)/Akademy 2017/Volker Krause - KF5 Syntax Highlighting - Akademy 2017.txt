Title: Volker Krause - KF5 Syntax Highlighting - Akademy 2017

Description: 
	Since KF5 5.28 you have the ability to easily integrate the robust and powerful syntax highlighting of Kate into your application even when embedding a fully featured code editor is not an option.

KF5::SyntaxHighlighting is a stand-alone implementation of the Kate syntax highlighting engine. Support for more than 250 different file formats is built in, and thanks to being based on XML syntax definition files it is easily extendable to support additional or custom formats.

While the history of Kate's highlighting engine goes back to the late 90s, it used to be heavily tied to the Kate editor. The same is true for the alternative implementation inside QtCreator, making re-use elsewhere usually infeasible. KF5::SyntaxHighlighting addresses this by only depending on Qt5::Gui and providing an abstraction for the output format, be it a complex custom text editor, a QSyntaxHighlighter or simple HTML, allowing you to easily integrate syntax highlighting into your application.
