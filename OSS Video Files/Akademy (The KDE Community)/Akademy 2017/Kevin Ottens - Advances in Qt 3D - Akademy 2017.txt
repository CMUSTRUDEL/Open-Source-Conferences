Title: Kevin Ottens - Advances in Qt 3D - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Having 3D scenes in your application is becoming a clear trend and is likely to become even more important in the future with the growth of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. So far Qt was allowing you to integrate with Open GL fairly easily, but managing the rendering code itself was still a very challenging task.

That's why Qt 5.7 introduced Qt 3D. Of course, it keeps evolving and in this talk we will highlight the novelties coming with 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10.

Since writing 3D code from scratch can be very difficult and since getting the architecture of your rendering engine right is critical to your application, Qt 3D will offload those risks from you so that you can focus on your actual simulation and 3D scene content.

In this talk, we will first do a quick recap of Qt 3D's API principles. In
particular it is structured around an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture which will be presented.

Then we'll have a tour of the newest features available in 5.8 and 5.9. Of particular interest to the community we will talk about painting to texture and we will show how to integrate a QtQuick 2 scene inside of a 3D scene. We will also present the new PBR materials, the new animation aspect and more...

If time permits, we will also give a sneak peak to a feature in the work meant to help managing shader code. This is currently private API but will be leveraged and exposed both in QtQuick and Qt 3D.

This talk will be interesting to any developer having to implement a 3D scene inside an application using Qt or thinking about bringing VR or AR use cases in the KDE community. No prior knowledge of Open GL or GPU programming is required for this talk.
