Thomas with his other hand hello people

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,319
I think you know me from past academies

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,819
and run the sessions it's the second

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,700
time that I'm working for a company that

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:07,220
has nothing to do with q2 Arkady Atlit

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,989
well that one started as a KD project at

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,569
krei so I think we'll know that it's it

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,900
was on cloud and then something happened

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:21,820
and became a next cloud for some reason

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:24,650
and we are currently the second biggest

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,990
open source cloud agent just behind on

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,750
clouds that we are surpassing so

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:34,360
basically we are the first and the

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,360
second biggest ones thank you

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:50,470
and then we have read it

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:54,220
whereas OG so thank you you may know me

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,470
for other things not related to in Katy

00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,580
not completely related to what I do in

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:03,340
in reddit but even if we don't do so

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,950
much for Katy still we have some

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,500
contributors and open source is part of

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,940
the core of the company so this is still

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
important for us if you have any

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,580
question about the company you know

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:22,030

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,300

name on here so sins of that and the

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,830
logo is also wrong so I should just go

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,760
back to the Katy t-shirt which has an

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,180
outdated KDE logo now anyway

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:27,840

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,789
more likely Oslo Berlin also was a great

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:38,310
place to be and it's also not as hot as

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:41,039
here yeah we do love Katie Katie comes

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,800

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,590
necessarily see Katie keeps us honest

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,680

general thanks

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,020
from the cute company

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,470
hello I'm Mirko and I'm glad to be here

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,550
at this Academy does everybody know what

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,919
the open invention Network is who knows

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,870
who does not okay so the open venture

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,910
network is a defensive patent pool

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,340
I know this is totally exciting right

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,169
the the mission that we have is to

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,020
protect Linux and generally open source

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,610
from any kind of patent litigation we

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,490
have seen in the past how bad leaders

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,150
can go wrong and we're doing our best to

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,590
prevent this from happening to our space

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,860
many companies here in the room are part

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,270
of our network if your company is not

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,940
part of a network I would like you to

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,940
encourage your company to look at it or

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,490
review it and join us and other than

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,190
that please keep on hacking produce lots

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,130
of very cool free software and see you

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,880
