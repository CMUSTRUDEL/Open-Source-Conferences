PAUL: So we're here with Jonathan Riddell, who is the guy behind Neon

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,090
and...well, what have we got on the table today?

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,549
JONATHAN: So, I'm at the KDE Neon stall today

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:22,049
I've got the KDE Slimbook, of course, which has been a very successful partnership with our friends over there at Slimbook Store, and

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:29,310
they've created this beautiful, shiny machine that you can buy with KDE Neon pre-installed so that you can be certain that...

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:37,559
...that we've tested the hardware so that you know it works with the software, which is not usually the case with installing Linux.

00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:44,999
And, specifically on this machine we're...I'm showing the Neon Docker images because I think that's a great way to

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,199
test and develop with KDE software, so if a user reports a bug, usually you go...

00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
User,

00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
that's the old version, can you please test it with the new version.

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,660
And they go, "my distribution doesn't have the new version, so no".

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,340
But using Docker images, it's trivial to download the latest image, and you've got new version right there.

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,600
So it's a one gigabyte download, and then you just run one command. Which is just the "neon docker" command, and

00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,539
then, unlike a virtual machine, it doesn't take ages to start up because it's using the same kernel.

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,559
So it's just...it starts up as fast as your normal desktop system will start up.

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,019
And there you can run a full Plasma session within...

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,100
...within your existing Plasma session, except it's a completely separate environment.

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,430
So this is a...that's using the unstable version. You can see we've got this new user interface, QML interface for System Settings there.

00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,609
I can say, well give me the latest user edition. Or just the latest released packages...

00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
...and you can start that at the same time.

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,620
And that will...that gets built daily by Neon.

00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,649
And it gets automatically updated from

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,910
updates on the KDE server so it's got the latest

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,750
released software, so it should be bug-free and perfect, and you can see that

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,470
it's running a different version

00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,420
so it's got the older, or the currently existing System Settings interface. And so, depending on what version people are reporting bugs against

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,020
or the version you want to develop against, you can easily try them both

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,030
PAUL: Excellent! And...

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,540
...so I have to ask

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,460
Is this already a distro or not a distro?

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,029
I mean, there's this controversy about if it's a distro or not... JONATHAN: Call it whatever you want.

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,749
PAUL: What do you call it? JONATHAN: I just call it a

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,319
continuous integration project. PAUL: A continuous integration project! JONATHAN: Buzzwordy PAUL: Okay. J: Because we only care about the KDE stuff.

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,578
So, a distro will typically care about ten thousand different

00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,959
projects from ten thousand different

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,999
open source projects. And we only care about KDE, and everything else is there just to support KDE.

00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,239
So it's a limited use-case if you want to use

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,970
the latest Gnome software or whatever

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,579
but if you're a KDE fan, or

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,979
interested in our software or want to be contributing to our software then this is the good stuff. PAUL: Right.

00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,959
Brilliant. Thanks very much! JONATHAN: So, over here... PAUL: Oh yeah! Sorry!

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,189
We also have a display with Plasma Mobile... PAUL: Right JONATHAN: and so this we've been developing for a number of years, and

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,870
it

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,169
feels like quite a slow-moving project at times because

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,389
unlike developing on desktop, where there's your typical, standard IBM PC, Intel stuff

00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,259
here, of course, every single of the devices has its own differences and challenges.

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,488
And we're using the Google Nexus 5x

00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,509
which is a pretty open and readily available device, and it's also

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,509
working with Project Halium, which means that now Plasma Mobile is working with the Ubuntu

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,629
Community team and a couple of other mobile teams working on a common platform, so that the whole

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,279
platform and device support should be the same across those different projects. But this is our

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,138
Plasma software which shares 90% of our codebase with the desktop.

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,340
But, of course, as different form factor, and thanks to Qt and

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:21,228
Kirigami and similar technologies, it's pretty easy to make a user interface that works across multiple different devices and different form factors.

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,340
And so, while it's nowhere near

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,830
consumer-ready, it is hacker-ready for people who want their traditional Linux

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,159
system, but in a mobile environment, so that the

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
applications can work across them both.

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,049
PAUL: Brilliant! Anything...any more surprises?

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,190
JONATHAN: That is about all I have on this stall.

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:52,969
We're also working on Snappy packages in Neon, which is the up-and-coming container format and

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,669
this we're going to be planning on how we...

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,769
sort of step back from our existing packages, which are Debian-based, and for KDE applications

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,000
we want to make Snappy packages for all KDE applications within the next couple months.

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,350
Which means that it will run on any distro. So we'll take away the question of

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,340
which underlying system you're running, because everybody will be able to run the latest KDE stuff.

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
PAUL: Okay. Brilliant. Thank you very much!

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,720
