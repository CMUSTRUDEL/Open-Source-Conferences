Title: Ivan Čukić - C++17 and 20 - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	C++ was asleep for a long time, but as Jon Kalb put it "the beast is back". We are getting a new version of the standard every few years.

Also, the compiler support is getting better with each day, with GCC and Clang leading the bunch.

C++17 included a few interesting features and many technical specifications of the features planned for C++20.

We will cover quite a few of them - from ranges, through concepts, to coroutines.
