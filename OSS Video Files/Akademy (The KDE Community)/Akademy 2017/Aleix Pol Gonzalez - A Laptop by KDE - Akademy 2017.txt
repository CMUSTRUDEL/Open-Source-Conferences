Title: Aleix Pol Gonzalez - A Laptop by KDE - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	We'll go over the process we went through between the opportunity, the set up of the initial idea and how it evolved with time and different people's contributions until we were able to have a product to deliver.

Furthermore, we'll look into what's the state of the project, what's the next steps and whether could we replicate the experience.
