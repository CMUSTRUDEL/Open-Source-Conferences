Introduction:
Mycroft Plasmoid is a desktop frontend that intends to interact with the Mycroft Core backend which is developed by the team at Mycroft Ai. It is an open source community committed technology that ties natural language processing, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and powerful APIs together to create a powerful experience allowing users to manipulate their devices through voice control. Mycroft Ai is the digital implementation of a modern day virtual assistant on the Linux Platform that can help a user conduct a multitude of task via voice / text.

Goals:
The Mycroft Plasmoid is developed with an aim towards integration of Mycroft Core backend with the Plasma 5 Desktop Environment to provide an open, user rich desktop and an interactive virtual assistant experience to the end users with keeping in mind the principles of free and open source software. This project also aims towards making the virtual assistant a central hub of information and desktop control assistance providing the user a new innovative layer of voice control and desktop interactive technology.
