Title: Vasudha - Ruqola: A Qt QML Interface to Rocket.Chat - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Ruqola is the first generic chat application based on Rocket.Chat. The application is a Qt/QML/C++ app, thus providing multi-platform portability. Ruqola will currently run on both Desktop and mobile (Android) platforms.

Ruqola is a Qt/QML interface to Rocket Chat, with a library implementing DDP semantics, and a QML UI for both desktop and mobile phones. Rocket Chat is a Web Chat Server, developed in JavaScript, using the Meteor framework. In Ruqola application, DDPClient class implements Meteor's DDP and Rocketchat backend class uses this "library" to pull in Rocket.Chat data.
Rocket.Chat is a great solution for communities wanting to privately host their own chat service or for developers looking forward to build and evolve their own chat platforms, and Ruqola is built on Rocket.Chat.
Ruqola is the first of its kind. After its initial release, it can be used by entire KDE organisation as a medium of communication.
Particularly for WikiToLearn, there is no application/platform where people can discuss the content (and its fidelity) provided at WikiToLearn Portal (https://en.wikitolearn.org/Main_Page). Since WikiToLearn chat exists for discussing development issues, there is a need for such an application for making discussing the content easier.

Ruqola will support following features (before the release of Ruqola 1.0)-
1. Support for notifications (on both desktop and mobile application).
2. Support for OAuth/federated login.
3. Generic UI which works for all servers.
4. Support for reactions.
5. Support for images.
