Title: Marco Martin - Kirigami, Applications, and Designers - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Lessons learned in balancing the development of an User Interface framework and designing an application: a virtuous feedback loop.

Were we want rigidity and where we want freedom. While designing the Kirigami user interface framework, was of course not possible to predict every possible use case of applications using it. During the design of applications like Discover, the feedback loop between the design and implementation of the application, improved significantly the quality of the framework, and new design elements percolated upwards in the framework and in the human interface guidelines. The quick talk will look at some of those examples, trough demos, code and pretty pictures.
