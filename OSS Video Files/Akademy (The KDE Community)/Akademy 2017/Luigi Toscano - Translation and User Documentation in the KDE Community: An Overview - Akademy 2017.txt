Title: Luigi Toscano - Translation and User Documentation in the KDE Community: An Overview - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	A working program is not enough if its potential users can not use it. The availability of translation and user documentation can make the life of the users easier. What does this mean in the KDE community?

Even if the knowledge of the English language is more widespread than in the past, a properly localized program can be accessed by more users, and translation is central part of it. On the other side, while the default behavior of a program should be "good enough", not everything can be directly self-discoverable. User documentation (and its translation!) can't simply go away.
The talk will try to answer questions like: how are the translation and documentation processes implemented in the context of the KDE community? What are the challenges? What are the possible future developments?
