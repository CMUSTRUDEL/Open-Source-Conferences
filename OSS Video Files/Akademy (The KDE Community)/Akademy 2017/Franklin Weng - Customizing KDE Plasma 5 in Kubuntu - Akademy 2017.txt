Title: Franklin Weng - Customizing KDE Plasma 5 in Kubuntu - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	We keep making our "ezgo" with KDE Plasma. However there were a lot more difficulties when customizing KDE Plasma 5...

ezgo is a customized Linux distribution derived from Kubuntu, Lubuntu and Xubuntu. In ezgo12 we used Kubuntu 14.04 and Plasma 4, which was wonderful and easy to customize. However in Kubuntu 16.04 with Plasma 5, many things changed...

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:27,340
a nor'easter is a disease and the

00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:36,399
particle but here I'm still facility is

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:44,439
on the right distribution customized by

00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:51,000
before the purpose of physical is to

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:51,000
most for free software patience

00:02:46,880 --> 00:03:02,660
anyway which one and then we have a

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,150
start right

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:11,860
so we choose one of them and then

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:15,770
because to prove these two newbie users

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,080
but in the users diversity is actually

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,020
the proof in service of warpath's

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,720
it also come uses a new user very much

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:29,810
so polymer users we just power exact

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,880
system turn on this we don't even know

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,880
actually you don't need to change

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:30,530
and that's what we roll

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:35,720
see there's other pcs this version these

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:40,790
debris she's new have seen the choose

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:45,080
where you are free that's not that's

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:48,620
mommy's new entrance the privacy was

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,650
asked for lesson speak because they they

00:05:48,620 --> 00:06:02,660
signatures but then we get the analogous

00:05:51,650 --> 00:06:10,250
so very this is if it be not come on

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:14,360
14.4 and the slowly circles so here I

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:21,100
was practicing the customizing here is

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,100
us to customize text up so that it uses

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:31,520
the customizer here means we didn't make

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:36,800
the assistant default so that we create

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,500
a new user they will have such firm so

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,980
it's not just missing and into your

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,920
homepage

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,800
no because the system has no mr. Lapham

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,850
we may only have black minister and the

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,080
lab user is creating original right so

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:58,250
the main decision before very important

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,600
so actually that's why every time I

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,509
asked question of customizing maybe

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:11,999
something welcome they don't

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:14,779
okay so before November 10 the what I

00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:17,999
use is I call it but you have a

00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,759
directory change to Python tip or the

00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:25,439
red changer image with the same value

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,619
okay that means okay

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:33,119
SUV to the fire the comics what I want

00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:36,300
and according you have of course the for

00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,319
example winter ever change the content

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,159
of this file

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:45,509
best not initially before they are not

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:48,269
the people they saw the before this text

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:54,949
up activity and we squished contender

00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:54,949
which responds design director change

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:08,309
content that is we cannot update if we

00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:11,610
optically the faculty override back to

00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:18,240
the third to the caveman people so we

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:28,769
need to turn off the the PDF so avoid

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:33,180
users agree because talking about

00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:37,019
starting the school who knows released

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:40,759
nominee stay in education not suppressed

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:44,399
of Debian and our studying poverty

00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:48,389
mainly extremists and I found out they

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:54,300
do it differently the last one for

00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:57,839
example in the accession that is when

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:01,410
the next window starts they put some

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:08,459
sweet examine the mechanical arts to

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:11,480
part one and put the main graphics so I

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,630
just told you that is economy equal

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,150
operation mainly very

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,770
because we can rise and solve them

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,250
together

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:23,830
adjust the ratio you know he's still

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,280
Chinese but we can say because if that's

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:39,430
obvious to each EX my Mississippi Bobby

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:42,370
is my SATs the query design as he stated

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:47,290
he weaker than ever

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,740
under the patient Jacob Riis remark and

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:55,840
here is that he needed a father for

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:59,590
movement fortifications and because we

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,760
changed the whole many subject so we

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:08,440
followed the SVG manage them with power

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,220
a city minister in events that you need

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,500
to define many merits so that they were

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,800
very really made what I want show them

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:22,210
what I want so that we customize or

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:25,540
mentally change the main everything and

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,410
so I just put these files people

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:33,190
and then was Kaimuki the s we thought

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,730
would read us before the consults and

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:42,400
all the environment very Barbara would

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:47,890
be back in the office decision so in

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:50,710
evil talk I use this way in making brand

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,640
pure brand eminent people

00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:58,810
my goal is does actor is storing the

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,240
native payment of native Debian I just

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:07,090
need to install another is equal

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:14,460
packages and evil does not work so of

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:14,460
course the perigee leads to babies so

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,940
[Music]

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:34,450
how do you say this is equal to Iranian

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,549
in very bus

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,549
[Music]

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:06,509
there you see the liver really for the

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:09,720
original fire department and I just need

00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:13,679
ended this one to overwrite it it will

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,490
be executive after the zero so I will

00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:21,329
need to change this file I just use the

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:30,199
novel over rabbit and the last should be

00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:34,290
the credit okay so I may need some

00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:40,050
packages for this so that I put new

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:43,110
value it will be coming so everything is

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:47,369
fine there is a fun this is you can say

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:52,189
missionary I have decoded also ready for

00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:52,189
menu but you were part of my physical

00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:11,110
show you this this is my obvious it is

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:15,649
video it's not nice and easy go many

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:19,100
okay so does about the human I just need

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:22,390
to restore native distribution then each

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:26,589
appendages also if you approximate X bum

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:35,570
bum okay so everything is fine

00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:39,730
everything fine then until kids but we

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,730
stock make the viscosity

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,480
every situation the first thing is that

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:56,440
my domain

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:56,440
I said how efficient in fairies

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:13,050
you can see that my main purpose is not

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:17,120
said if you go us it is not harmonies no

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:23,639
matter how I said it always read k5

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:33,089
duration always so I can no way the only

00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:41,250
way to do is that I can only remove the

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:51,689
original Miss America because Omega PI 7

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:55,170
per variable always switch oh okay the

00:14:51,689 --> 00:15:00,980
natural question is that we have any

00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:05,939
robot the provide support are some

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:10,019
settings on aggravation but before we

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:15,439
really Lisa Kelly for our see any human

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:19,130
city of you for partridges I have no

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:22,410
documents no money for tell me the

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:28,759
fashions I used every 40 points

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:32,610
Erica's points that I try to find source

00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:36,240
the natural light source the source

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:42,740
domain is should use any files but not

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,740
document said that nothing that we know

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,670
yeah the missing so I'll ask again

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:36,010
surfing around each time we because

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,740
Allah if they miss traditional they stop

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:43,010
if activity you have publishing menu and

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,710
also be necessary sir Hajj is so

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:52,520
powerful the touch screen you can use at

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:57,850
all spread company and I also remember I

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,850
also own some parts in such an emotion I

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:11,360
remember that in the Christmas star then

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:17,920
the most important tourism is in

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:21,220
caravans system become assisting in

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,220
happier days

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,259
[Music]

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,489
[Music]

00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:55,539
I try to customize these on this in this

00:18:48,639 --> 00:19:03,929
version and even forehead because what

00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:11,049
makes me most is police in many projects

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:14,729
it was I just set up the environment the

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:18,369
very prominent in the accession starts

00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:21,820
before they grow and it works but

00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:24,310
investment by the another developer

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,730
bless me doesn't

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:32,430
if the enemy is us let's meet now the

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:36,480
developer told me another way he said it

00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,480
may be like this very

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:47,740
even so he tried to China for me he

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:54,910
tried creat a vocation present show in

00:19:47,740 --> 00:20:01,810
the then with his environment right and

00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:06,100
then his name hey it was it was but my

00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:09,130
version is that yes it was but first I

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:13,990
don't know a different document saying

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:18,850
that settings even this was quite my

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:22,600
always didn't work to mean I think my oh

00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:26,580
well just put it in exceptionally before

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:31,510
the canisters issues just follow the

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:35,500
environment variable issue is as

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:41,650
initially even I didn't issue it

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:47,770
inherited for terrorism in the remember

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:52,540
that time but it didn't and this time is

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:55,350
that last week thus the first time I got

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,350
an answer

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,240
I hope

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,970
just fix all the problems we do a new

00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:57,029
systems is we have distribution called

00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,740
Netra which is a customized neon 92

00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,779
exactly all these things that you do

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,350
have a custom menu and all of the sudden

00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:07,230
if you want to look into it tonight

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,419
Google for look and feel package so one

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,179
thing that's new of notify us we have a

00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:14,880
system called local few packages and

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,460
what local few package can supply is a

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,100
custom layout of GS file in this

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,039
initialization scripts for every class

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,440
might be custom you'll know stuff like

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,110
your own lock screen theme and officer

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,350
we get you all of the stuff into a you

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:36,389
can steal package which is actually that

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:38,700
we make the right place and the complete

00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:41,070
packages you can hear from default you

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,200
can just overwrite or to me so you can

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,549
make your own they out there you can

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:51,470
even you can add an initialization step

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,470
for example it better

00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:00,980
and asset-backed initialize actually

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,680
it's much better than that before it's

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,230
just pretty good place and the problem

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:11,480
of obviously our documentation Saxon can

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:14,210
final but so I would say you also your

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,640
bonus and how we do that we take notes

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:36,820
and then we write dog specs on that so

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:40,310
the next we do you know a DVD we divert

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,130
because you have different periods to

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:51,950
welcome the differ from one package that

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:54,530
you replace everything so this one we

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:58,540
did with the user that's definitely one

00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:03,680
problem we're having a ball a to do so

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:06,670
but our accent we feel like you need

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,670
more princess

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,789
[Music]

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,220
so

00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,710
