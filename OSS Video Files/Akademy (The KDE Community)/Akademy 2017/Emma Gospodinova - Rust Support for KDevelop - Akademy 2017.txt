Title: Emma Gospodinova - Rust Support for KDevelop - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Rust is a rather new programming language, but it has already gained a lot of traction. It was voted “most loved” language by developers for the second year in a row in the StackOverflow developer survey. There have been projects made using Rust on everything from operating systems to game engines for Minecraft-like games. Despite this, IDE support is still lacking. KDevelop currently does not support Rust at all. The goal of this Google Summer of Code project is to add the standard features an IDE should support for a language such as semantic highlighting, code completion, refactoring, debugging and project management.
