Title: Jos van den Oever - ODF Support in Calligra - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Calligra has native support of ODF. That does not mean that it's perfect. In this talk we'll look at a number of areas of ODF and see how well they are supported. This is compared to other office suites.

The ODF plugfests have resulted in many tests to check ODF compliance. These can be run against Calligra and this shows some points that could do with improvements.

The talk will highlight easy and harder tasks that can be undertaken to extend ODF support in Calligra.
