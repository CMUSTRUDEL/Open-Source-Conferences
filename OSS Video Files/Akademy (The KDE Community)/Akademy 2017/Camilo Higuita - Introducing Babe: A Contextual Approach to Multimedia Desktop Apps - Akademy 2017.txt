similar artist packs that are willing to

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:03,660
assign this work

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:06,690
and some examples to define we want a

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,780
faster stronger we think you learn and

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,929
the legionary suggestions

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,929
[Music]

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,220
I probably do because it's like just

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,260
start we need one point and thank you

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:31,170

[Music]

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,370
[Music]

00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:09,750
personality their army how relationships

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:14,339
work to make suggestions also

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:18,230
conventional because is to get extra

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,230
information for example

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:28,700
is what is this I'm talking about and

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,700
also always whether they do courtesy

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:37,550
also these religious perspective enough

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,550
information to present legal information

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:58,860
so and this is don't be we mga

00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:09,570
that stops for you see and so friendly

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:16,080
Romania but this music to movies to read

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:22,700
yes the books to dance to images simple

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,700
I just became give information of

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,950
[Music]

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:33,360
information across with information that

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:39,870
we believe and that way the content will

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:50,820
be more aware and another some points

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:55,230
for documents of our human interest you

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:58,620
know wouldn't have to be a specific

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:01,690
[Laughter]

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,690
[Music]

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,490
[Laughter]

00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:11,689
so the first step to take detective it

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,689
is to create an important

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:32,250
using mythology but the class that I

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:37,830
strike that is when he was well Alexis

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:45,270
but it was a trigger just special

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:55,250
effects when I'm using music studies

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:55,250
structure into intro by using relational

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:06,680
structure by saying this funny asam is

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,680
about our

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:30,990
the pertinency so this way as a

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:47,220
pregnancy because the bridge is half our

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:51,050
cars so they're able to be part means to

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,050
keep resource to parties

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:03,899
and all the other making new products

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:07,740
that will expand the knowledge to music

00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:11,339
but when your recon files my documents

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:16,880
human service videos and the president's

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:20,909
for the people of your verus fade away

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:27,260
when you can chuck know and while

00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:32,280
spreading my history is kinda like when

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:37,770
were jus with us or requests for of two

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:42,270
acuity or some business and we'll give

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:45,590
you the results they are similar to to

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,590
attract to the English

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,329
[Music]

00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:56,239
okay information from the party itself

00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:59,969
or journals using database we don't

00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:21,320
excite variation of we'll get from the

00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:25,219
files somehow the information that I

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,799
become able to stop from on fire

00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:33,190
document music Bank formation is going

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,759
to be only about the replication

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:42,749
yes or that information can also help

00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:45,519
III the amount on their file itself and

00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:58,229
losing currently the solution of

00:19:45,519 --> 00:20:05,499
information and application technology

00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:09,580
somebody's and the music are beginner

00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:16,320
and awkward you can fight the bridge

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:21,299
they also be able to knowledge

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,299
suggestions for music
