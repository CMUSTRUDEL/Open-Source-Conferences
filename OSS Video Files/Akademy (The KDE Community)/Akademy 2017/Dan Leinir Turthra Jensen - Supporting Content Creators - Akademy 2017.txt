Title: Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen - Supporting Content Creators - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Would it not be lovely if everybody was free to simply do what they wanted, without having to worry about the movement of small, coloured pieces of paper? Unfortunately that is not the world in which we live. So, how so you satisfy your need to eat and pay bills and the like when publishing on the KDE Store? How do you let people do so if you use the store, either as a consumer, or as a software developer? Well, take a seat, and you shall see!

The KDE Store is primarily used by people to provide a very great deal of free content for the software created by both the KDE community and other communities. However, while it does support paid downloads, there are other ways of supporting the amazingly creative people out there, who may not want to put a price tag on their content, but still want to pay their bills and eat food from time to time.

In this talk you will see what options exist, and how they are made available to both the creative people who provide their amazing content, and to people who want to make use of that content. Finally, we will touch on how you might use this in applications, using the KNewStuff frameworks.
