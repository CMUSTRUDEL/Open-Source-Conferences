Title: Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen - Supporting Content Creators - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Would it not be lovely if everybody was free to simply do what they wanted, without having to worry about the movement of small, coloured pieces of paper? Unfortunately that is not the world in which we live. So, how so you satisfy your need to eat and pay bills and the like when publishing on the KDE Store? How do you let people do so if you use the store, either as a consumer, or as a software developer? Well, take a seat, and you shall see!

The KDE Store is primarily used by people to provide a very great deal of free content for the software created by both the KDE community and other communities. However, while it does support paid downloads, there are other ways of supporting the amazingly creative people out there, who may not want to put a price tag on their content, but still want to pay their bills and eat food from time to time.

In this talk you will see what options exist, and how they are made available to both the creative people who provide their amazing content, and to people who want to make use of that content. Finally, we will touch on how you might use this in applications, using the KNewStuff frameworks.

by then that maintenance it's about

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
supporting content creators

00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:13,310
but that works pretty right after the

00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:13,310
voluntary technical school I'm guessing

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:28,440
and the reason that's interesting will

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:32,940
become a member of community committee

00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:36,750
vote since 2002 my thoughts your

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,540
accountant make my first trippin steps

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,729
in to see I submitting a public blog to

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,830
the family close as completely about in

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,500
America seven different parts of our

00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:55,430
court and since then I've been sort of

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,430
moving through community

00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:08,330
yes was instigating member of the

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:10,640
gaining freedom project which is why the

00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,540
science thing was important because it

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,420
allowed me to have some time to dedicate

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:30,490
to this project is no longer thing

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:30,490
however its which is as

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:50,750
a part of the cake is 13 and it's and do

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,380
on the in freedom thing is helped us

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,830
cement a vision for social software

00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:02,870
distribution based around the open

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,270
vibration services and that sort of

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,459
allowed us to come to grips with what

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,959
some of those issues and existing

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:16,010
software and content distribution

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,990
community we have some things and had it

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,130
for some time you know is not a problem

00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:27,130
at all which is a lot of content we have

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:30,590
a lot of very active creators both cold

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,310
doctor practices we have really

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,959
enthusiastic people and we even have the

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,959
way of getting started

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:51,220
operation services they which back then

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,410
was called get what new stuff it was

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,790
told after that a long time because no

00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:00,010
one could come up with he turn that

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,950
wasn't first wedding to be described

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,100
with it what which is then preparation

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:09,730
services is slightly buzz learning get

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,130
her new stuff as a naming basically

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,920
describes it really well it's a way of

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:20,400
getting hot new style which is why the

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:28,030
framework that we have to support is

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:30,040
basically the problems because is they

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,400
sleep we always want to attract more

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:39,930
people we want more context we have

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,930
quite a lot of it it's nice shiny stuff

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:48,910
and then one problem we've got is that

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:53,110
we need some way of enhancing people who

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:58,750
are not necessarily free software free

00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:00,070
culture people people who have bills to

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:05,180
pay

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,770
which also I guess matches most of us is

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,440
this

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,340
it is obviously lesser than issue to me

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:22,640
as a student because that was being a

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:24,290
student there is some kind of ideal but

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,840
that's just the norm

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,450
whereas when you get a little bit older

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,700
you realize that you have bills and

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,580
massive debts and we kind of want to

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,920
make those little bit smaller or easier

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,310
to manage so we need some way of dealing

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,970
with us we want to be able to offer that

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,080
to people

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:49,280
so a description of some of the texts

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,580
that we have in existence which and I

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,840
was to support that kind of situation we

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,570
have this thing called the open

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,230
collaboration services part of the

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:04,730
social desktop it was called github new

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:07,490
stuff but it's now called oh yes of

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,460
course you'll know if you used in any

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,130
software essentially built by daily over

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,900
the last decade you will have seen these

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:19,610
little buttons with the style necklaces

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:25,490
get the wallpapers or download which

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:28,250
February's Kylie hates us being the kind

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,360
of being basically the same trick that

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:35,220
is employed on the Android store any

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,730
kind of - game or anything

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,640
of anything to the Android Play Store

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,430
that's why the 50 makes so you need to

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,290
let them have a similar situation with

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:54,120
things like paste up with the datasets

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:55,800
are somewhere in we know 500 things you

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,470
obviously can't stick that's when it is

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,740
the shooting CD who you can shoot a

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:12,420
star's itself which is sort of small so

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:15,630
we have that is also using OCS and of

00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,790
course of the over the decades everybody

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:23,160
has a cheat on it at some point or

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:24,420
another in a sense of business over one

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,540
of the most of it

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,120
well Norman issues is a very technical

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,700
but very silly issue basically it was

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,660
built around what was available on Katie

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:40,980
look at the time which means that we

00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:46,350
don't have a list of preview images we

00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:49,710
have a specific number of predefined

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:52,560
potential previews which means that

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,910
there is a maximum of ten from them and

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,910
hardly treatment

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:04,789
however or that apart through all of the

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,819
various attempts at killing it out of

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:16,569
changing it drastically or facing with

00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:21,770
something I was still here and so yeah

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:26,779
this is basically first anniversary see

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:28,009
us is an accident last year of the main

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,379
server implementation

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,529
finally after a decade of attempting to

00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:37,130
make it happen becoming bikini project

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,409
so everything and free software most

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:44,360
importantly yes it wasn't at the time

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:47,930
and for various reasons but all of the

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,959
server-side implementation is mal true

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,790
free software is if we could make it any

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,470
freedom you watch but there are some

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,360
there's always slight issues with that

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,769
sort of thing which means that the

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,940
dancer is currently still owned by some

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:08,839
commercial entity because that's a

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,730
protection in this station he Germany

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,649
doesn't know about you transfer to

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,910
another and that's actually kind of nice

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:18,769
so we means that all of those all of the

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,990
massive amount of data we've had is

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:26,290
still there and it's still protected

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,290
basically means that it's very nice

00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:00,720
basically as a similar source of

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:04,000
contracted 3q Foundation exists for a so

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:12,839
it just allows an external entity to run

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:15,100
it but in case new systems 501 as well

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,170
whatever the co I cannot honestly

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,810
remember but the commercial entity that

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,329
currently runs the ad store has a poison

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,190
pill in place that if ever they were to

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:27,910
do something that the community about

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:34,970
does not like that commercial entity

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:40,269
loses rice to host and lose the rights

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:43,730
to the conference so the server

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:46,790
components of it is split into three

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,519
very happy osseous file server which is

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:54,529
a success example that a Content store

00:10:49,519 --> 00:11:00,110
it hosts all of the actual content it's

00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:02,000
a distributed system it's a lot more

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,449
stable better not stable it's a lot more

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,290
scalable as an architecture than the old

00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:11,029
one which was very mean but not

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,600
stainable and actually run on a single

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:17,569
server which if we're trying to do

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,139
software distribution the site as well

00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:24,740
isn't we know it's all about this

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:26,420
there's the CDN which is really really

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,050
small this accommodation via network

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:33,199
kind of similar to narrow brain and then

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,990
there is the OCS web server which is

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:39,680
sort of the things that most people will

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,939
see it's got the web store itself so all

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,550
of the various web sites

00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:45,550
this is this free visited here

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:55,170
but sorrow bombs as well so if you want

00:11:51,959 --> 00:12:10,079
to look into some if you forgotten that

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:15,810
certain things exist it's like so all of

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:18,899
the content that existed in daily still

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:25,130
exists it's just being put to one side

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:25,130
slightly still not quite so in-your-face

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:37,160
it's almost all so they go through RSS

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:40,339
which is if you want to show inserting

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,339
categorical data

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,050
there's the button buttons and widgets

00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,180
and things so if you have a piece of

00:12:46,050 --> 00:13:00,449
content on the store that you want to

00:12:48,180 --> 00:13:03,139
show to people on her own website I was

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:06,920
using my own castle which is ancient

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,899
many more example there the first

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,079
supports around right now that can set

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,660
because no one supports it that's not a

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:23,059
be sad when we think that's just

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:25,249
visitors and there is perhaps most

00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:31,790
importantly for us in this case the OGS

00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:40,540
API identity which is a thin Nexus

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:44,769
wrapper which sports OCS web server and

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:48,499
the important thing here is that we have

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:50,209
access to the whole stack now which

00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:52,970
means that we have problems in the

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:56,059
aspect yes it would be nice if we could

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:59,239
extend okay new stuff which I'll get to

00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:02,389
in a second with some more stuff but we

00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:06,199
couldn't because getting certain things

00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:11,269
into the API would take in in certain

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:18,879
cases literal years so not really very

00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:18,879
nice the entirely simple social issues

00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:32,119
so but the end result was that not so

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:36,970
now that we have that kind of control we

00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:38,850
can actually do some of this and then

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,000
extra little bit

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:53,570
[Music]

00:14:41,000 --> 00:15:01,070
give me facility and then we have also

00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:05,800
announced after the register itself

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:08,900
becoming free software because it also

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,430
speaks of King Gustav and supreme well

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:16,070
which was that we now have in effect 3d

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,500
frameworks rather than one it's all

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,540
still in the same single week but the

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,210
effect is that we have kings of core

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:30,320
which now has all of the non user

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:32,720
interface related functionality of a new

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,630
style itself which is named a little bit

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:49,520
silly because of historical reasons we

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:53,320
cannot change the language but that one

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:57,470
is way of English of course here too now

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,390
the reason for that being an important

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,960
thing is that longer I think a new start

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:08,230
three depending on in particularly

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:11,230
dependent on Keo and Kol GUI which

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,230
combines

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:19,750
and we have a lot of projects who were

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:23,140
reluctant to use in stuff because there

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,880
are new batch dependencies are a problem

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:38,980
if you want to distribute on things that

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:41,110
are not linear so yeah it's a big

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:46,150
problem so we needed to be able to split

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:50,910
it up it's kind of the same way as so

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:53,740
that happens quickest and one the server

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:57,730
recent work happening was that we wanted

00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:03,820
to get a set of quick components many

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:07,870
with access in yourself and having to

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:16,440
require widgets to be added to your

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:16,440
project so as a very simple

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:34,150
so the sort of most important plants

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,760
here that I was talking about before is

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,100
the money side of it so this is the

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,910
status the technology that we already

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,750
have

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:49,900
so what am I going to do so we want to

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:54,100
be able to financially support the

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,549
people who created the content oh don't

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,970
worry

00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:01,809
very importantly is we don't want to

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,539
particularly stick on the table in the

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:08,320
content creation community at the moment

00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:12,850
there is this thing called patreon which

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:18,039
is being Vsauce much duration between

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:26,429
carbon creators who are you in the

00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:29,890
variety of ways and some of them very

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:33,159
heavily oriented towards no one will see

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:38,770
the stuff that I create unless you pay

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:40,900
me so that's that there is already as

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,919
assistant for insist on patreon

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,960
we don't particularly want to create but

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,860
what we do want to do is we want to make

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,429
it

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,020
see that's Lucy for everybody involved

00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:56,080
we want to make it easy to comfort

00:18:53,020 --> 00:19:01,299
created the application creators and we

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:04,120
want to make ability for tunes and we

00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:06,790
also want to make it predictable so

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,679
that's the thing that things like

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:16,570
patreon does you had a very well-defined

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:19,740
must in outgoing and that's really

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:23,230
powerful if you want to support someone

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,450
you you can support them in a number of

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:33,510
ways so donations is one way but we also

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:36,429
have a subscription system and what we

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,860
the sort of thing that came up in the

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:42,880
discussion at least was the idea that it

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:46,080
should be almost accidental not actually

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,640
accidental because spending money

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,260
accidentally generally speaking is quite

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:58,260
a bad thing so we've got to make it so

00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:02,260
easy that you can very mean person so

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:07,929
yeah that's entitled means it was late

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:08,520
at night and so there are two different

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,850
things

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,160
we have the donation system which is a

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:20,540
direct payment system you make a choice

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:26,330
I want to give some money to this create

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:37,280
content in tennis course yes that is

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:41,690
terrific to the donation page so that's

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:45,980
expose already the the application

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:50,630
developers equivalent this because it is

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:53,960
very deliberately no payment system no

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:57,130
donation payment system implemented on

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,620
the cable store because we want to

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:04,280
essentially pass out that kind of thrust

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:15,290
to someone else so if you're using

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:18,290
PayPal we want to because it's very big

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:21,740
thing to you know convince people to

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:24,170
pass money through you and they in one

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:28,930
of those cases where we don't

00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:31,370
particularly want to straight money and

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,160
the easiest way of convincing people

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,860
that will not straight in front of lower

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,890
transactions is not to do it ourselves

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,470
so we're passing that to something else

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,930
and then the money you know the money

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,930
goes directly in the case

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:54,840
to country future but very specifically

00:21:51,039 --> 00:22:01,500
we don't straight any other process

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:05,350
there is them the things which is the

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:10,750
automatic excitement so that's the sort

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:14,950
of predictable app goings and almost

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:17,590
accidental attacks so it's all done

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,909
automatically it's happening for the

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,970
last two months and none of you've

00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:24,610
noticed unless you suddenly got ready

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,500
yeah unless you have some stuff on the

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,570
ladies door that was popular that kind

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,279
of you suddenly got so money in your

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:36,880
bank account and in Dover came through

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:42,149
its interactive based missus currently

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:46,419
what barrel equals one sense that is

00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:49,740
always subject to change if you have

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:55,630
ideas for this is kind of clockwise

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:58,450
there is the point here that this is the

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:05,100
known outwards the idea is that claims

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:08,830
are supported by users on the site a

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,860
known outgoing everyone currently

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,500
there's not very provision for this but

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,950
the idea is that you have the ability to

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,320
paying a sum every month which then gets

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,020
distributed amongst

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:26,370
created on the site he's not a client

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:30,540
and he never will be but if you want to

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:32,250
master it and then there's a lot here

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:38,880
for it where again

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:42,480
donations are distance and that's yes

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,990
those are the two things relations the

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,540
outcomes that you've got a damaged you

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,880
don't particularly know necessarily what

00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,770
if you are spending every month but the

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,790
contains essentially whatever rank you

00:23:52,770 --> 00:24:00,810
want using the system the automatic

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:03,240
system you have place a set amount every

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:10,010
month you know exactly how much you're

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:19,530
able to support creativity and education

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:23,850
it's a very which basically is again

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:27,030
because I only got a small amount of

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,330
things along the candy store which is

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,659
all very

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,760
[Applause]

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:36,210
but they're charging weapons

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:40,470
so in your budget logging if you think

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:45,330
on these things it will show you a take

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:51,149
out front that possible payments they

00:24:45,330 --> 00:25:00,299
are for this month and in which he gives

00:24:51,149 --> 00:25:06,120
you miss very very much because resting

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:17,809
evening so yes obviously this is all

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:17,809
agency go instantly one of these things

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:26,850
but yet so the idea here is infant actor

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,399
can be changed at inside at any rate and

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,059
that's the important bit here please if

00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:37,590
you guys have ideas for what what would

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:42,049
be good as a metric for guessing what

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,049
sort of stuff is good

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:55,000
but it says the pastor the King system

00:25:51,220 --> 00:26:06,210
is M as well also stings did you go in

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:06,210
settings politician

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:25,919
oh yes the next slide is is please tell

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,919
us mr. talk to us

00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:42,769
that as in URLs and we're project is the

00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:47,029
fabricator so again it used to be that

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:49,099
you had to go to a person gay people was

00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:50,719
certainly a happy baby but

00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:52,909
mathematically in the infrastructure

00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:59,259
these days if we have ideas that they

00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:59,259
restore its yes

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,010
and so you can fashion

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,010
[Music]

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,170
[Music]

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:15,760
but yes

00:28:29,890 --> 00:29:08,050
yeah creator implementation there is no

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:14,140
reason why you couldn't create an

00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:14,140
account on the cable store for a project

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:52,180
uses so whoever has the project yeah

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,180
just before

00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:03,669
whether or not

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,130
[Music]

00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,900
[Music]

00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:31,000
I think overlapping ideals and

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:38,980
specifically focused at least it makes a

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:48,970
lot of sense to store the content

00:31:38,980 --> 00:32:05,970
distribution site it is possible that

00:31:48,970 --> 00:32:05,970
some you get a content creator you are

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,710
staying in there that would be

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,710
interesting it's not

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:42,570
receive what the restroom you get to

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:51,600
know Peter people everybody that's the

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:54,890
boats out like and everything to thank

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,890
