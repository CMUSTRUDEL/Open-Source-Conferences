good morning I'm Sebastian Coogler I

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:19,350
work for blue systems and I've been a

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:22,590
caddy developer for 11 years yeah so

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,369
today um there will be an announcement

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:31,500
and it will be about a KT software store

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,059
and we gave the subtitle rethinking

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,660
software distribution because that's

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:41,460
that is really what we are what were

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:45,350
aiming to start with this project let's

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:50,250
take it let's take a few steps back so

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,379
15 years ago Frank Carly check was over

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,149
there raise your right stand up yeah

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,070
he's hiding now because he's a really

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:02,969
shy guy started open desktop which was a

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,960
site to distribute add-on content for

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,720
KDE applications and the KDE desktop as

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,470
it was called back then nowadays of

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,580
course plasma add-ons are for example

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,909
wallpapers additional scripts themes so

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,820
all kinds of contents that enrich your

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,200
desktop and that would lead to you being

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,310
able to customize your desktop and

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,780
applications a lot more you can also

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,119
think of add-ons for different

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,159
applications for example maps in marble

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,110
that kind of stuff so pretty much

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,729
everything but applications themselves

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,270
applications themselves were a bit

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,640
problematic since there are 200

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,890
different distributions and they all

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,829
have different formats they all have

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,090
different versions so you get a really

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,250
complex matrix of all binaries and

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,880
that's just not very practical to

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,890
distribute more about that later

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,520
unfortunately Frank has a really cool

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,430
new hobby actually

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,910
I don't think it's obvious it's really

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,160
ah be any more but Frank had other

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,680
things to do so there wasn't a lot of

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,060
maintenance of open desktop it would it

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:29,370
still worked it was integrated I it was

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:33,030
running but it wasn't really developed

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:36,610
it was very innovative when it launched

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:41,590
but after a few years different services

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:43,300
popped up and it was superseded in terms

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,820
of functionality features user

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,880
experience by things like Google's

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,660
google play Apple's App Store and

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:57,220
similar services one of the cool things

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,710
about open desktop is said it uses an

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,740
open API to talk to the server so

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,770
there's a well-defined way to get at all

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:12,070
this gutted all this content it's in its

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:14,860
rest base API XML in there and this API

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,560
is used for example in plasma to allow

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,880
add-on insulation you can think of I'm

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,530
being able to install additional

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,680
wallpapers also from a KD point of view

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:31,660
these sites were run by a third party

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,900
and something which has been bugging a

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:38,770
lot of people was that the service was

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,900
always proprietary there were some some

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,640
of the attempts to make it free software

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,200
but it never really worked out for

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,810
different for for various reasons so

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:59,230
what happened this year blue systems

00:03:51,810 --> 00:04:02,020
acquired open desktop the sites and put

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,350
it into a sister company called pling

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,570
the goal was to open source this

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,000
technology and make it available and

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,459
bring it back to life and you know

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,479
restart development because we think

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,919
it's a really important part of the

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:22,320
there's a lot of your user experience on

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,419
the desktop and it can solve a pretty

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,949
pretty big problem with respect to

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,160
software installation add-ons

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:34,990
installation and we also wanted to have

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,810
some some cooler features so what

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,599
happened is that we turned Katie look

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,710
and Katie files and all these I think

00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:47,080
about 60 satellite sites into a KD

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:52,720
branded store kept these things alive

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:57,910
and make the and we made the associated

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,830
data available to to KD so there was a

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:08,080
migration happening in the background

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:11,199
and that happened so this big problem of

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,550
katie's reliance on a proprietary third

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:19,780
party store has now been solved and you

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,120
probably didn't really notice it but it

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,360
was it was replaced pretty much

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,449
transparently in the background so the

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,690
back end for the for the service was

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:36,310
replaced with a more modern scalable

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:38,020
codebase the content was I was cleaned

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,750
up during migrations all these things

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:45,659
that didn't work for example when people

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:49,539
were uploading opensuse 7.2 rpm packages

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:53,710
that just wouldn't work on almost any

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:58,180
machine the content was was cleaned up

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,620
so all the all the links went away so

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,659
the things that are on that I should

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,030
actually work if they don't let us know

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:06,789
and we'll clean that up there were some

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:12,580
minor mishaps because we remapped

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:14,560
categories but aside from that it all

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,650
went smoothly and we didn't really have

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,949
a lot of a lot of complaints and I never

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,020
noticed it that it that it didn't work

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:25,539
the service is maintained by plane as I

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,900
said that's the sister company of blue

00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,200
systems and what's the really important

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,140
thing

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,200
is we signed a agreement with KETV

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,680
because we do not just want to make the

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,320
source code available we want Katie to

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,750
be able to continue the service that's a

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,970
really important thing with respect to

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,060
independence free software gives you

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:53,200
independence but we all know that if

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,490
there's a web service title title it you

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,460
can have the software but if you don't

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,130
have all the content then you pretty

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,580
much start from scratch and a lot of a

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:07,960
lot of the value goes away so the

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,980
continuity from from for the past has

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:15,730
been taken care of and the continuity

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:20,530
into the future is now guaranteed also

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:24,040
and that is something I really like no

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,680
ads on the website there are no fees for

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,560
for using it so you can try it out

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,650
there's no no financial risk whatsoever

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,770
you can get donations and one hundred

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,320
percent of these donations that reach

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,040
you through the site are for you so

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:46,570
there's no twenty percent fee for the

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,240
big brother it's a bit more about the

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:52,750
service as I said it's a it's new code

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,720
base we actually imported this new code

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,830
base under a new license in to kds git

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,650
repositories and it's out licensed under

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:06,670
the a GPL which is very suitable for web

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:10,690
services it is also actively developed

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,640
under the KD umbrella so we got some new

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,160
community members and their who worked

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,310
on the code base previously and will

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,360
continue to do so and the whole project

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,880
has been incubated into Katie as a KD

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,630
project because it's a really vital part

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,810
too many KDE applications for the best

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:34,270
place from a logical point of view is to

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,120
do it in KD but KD is also a very

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:41,080
suitable organization for hosting free

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,280
software project so what can we do with

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,210
it

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,920
our first focus was on migrating to the

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,530
new service cleaning it up and basically

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,450
doing the homework that hasn't really

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,700
been happening in the past years so it's

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,030
cleaned up and the features that were

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,850
there previously an installation of

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:06,170
themes wallpapers icons risso's plasmoid

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,750
so all the non compiled content that is

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,000
still there what's also pretty cool is

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:15,050
you can receive donations through the

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,420
site now because we want to make it

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,540
worthwhile for people to work on these

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,240
things and maybe this can generate a bit

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,820
of a stream of income for people that

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,410
encourages more people to take part so

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,500
we get more content we create a rich

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:35,180
ecosystem we get a better better product

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:38,420
and we get happier users one thing about

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,990
open open desktop is it wasn't just KDE

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,950
focused but there were signs for xfce

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,740
for fog gnome not as tightly integrated

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,540
into their software but still valuable

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,400
in the were there and they are still

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:57,370
there and they're running and they're

00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:00,620
actually better now so for example the

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:04,190
wallpapers you would upload a wallpaper

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,240
for Katie but then it wasn't offered in

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:12,710
Nome so now i can upload wallpaper and

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:15,830
gnome users see it as well same for xfce

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:19,430
and that's even trinity look and what i

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,910
just discovered that's really cool

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,780
there's a historical look and it has

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,190
like Katie two screenshots and all that

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,160
so if you had a few drinks and want to

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:35,990
be melancholic about the past then you

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:40,070
should definitely go there we also said

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:44,030
together and when we thought okay we can

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:46,340
actually solve the actual problems but

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,100
how can we make a cooler what do we want

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:53,840
to do with it what do we what do we want

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,080
to achieve and given its now free

00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,570
software and and

00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,700
we're working on it and the backlog of

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,270
homework has been done and there's a few

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:07,650
things which we want to get going and in

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,630
the future what I don't really like and

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,210
plasma we spend so much time on

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,900
polishing the product and then someone

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,750
uploads a really bad wallpaper and the

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:23,760
default is that the newest content gets

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:37,080
thrown first and you know you basically

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:46,980
do let me try so yeah this is coming

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:48,630
from the new store really okay I thought

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:54,960
I learned a few years ago that live

00:11:48,630 --> 00:12:01,800
demos are not a good idea um yeah I am

00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:11,190
connected um but hey this time I'm

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:13,590
prepared okay eat that Murphy so we got

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,870
the wallpapers there and of course the

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,570
wallpapers I did which you can see in

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:22,380
there there let's say decent quality

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:25,530
what someone might upload a picture of

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:28,200
their scrawny dog really nice for one

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,900
person not necessarily if the first

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,190
thing I want to see in one of the really

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:38,190
prominent features for plasma desktop

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:40,260
that's why we want to have vetted

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:44,160
content we want to have some review

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,490
process we still want to be able for

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,130
everybody to let me just get back to the

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,130
presentation we still want everybody to

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:04,569
yes we still want everybody to upload

00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:06,729
their content so we don't want any kind

00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:09,579
of censorship or that kind of stuff so

00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:12,220
that's just not in our spirit but we

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:14,559
want to make our product look really

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,470
polished so that'd content some kind of

00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,949
review process is nice and this is also

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,769
a really good way to involve more people

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,720
to rope them into working with us

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,279
because this doesn't lead developer

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,519
skills and there's a lot of artists

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,899
around that don't really they do have a

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,789
free software heart but they don't

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:35,349
really know where to put things and

00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:39,909
that's not a central place to redraw the

00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:42,220
free software users so they get quickly

00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:43,479
get into yeah which desktop do I

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:51,879
actually want to support whether they

00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:55,029
really don't care so yeah review

00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:58,959
processes are going to make our products

00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:02,470
look better then some of things can

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,749
actually be executed on the on the

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,169
client machine even if it's just a

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:11,709
plasmoid written in qml you can do some

00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:14,499
nasty things with it so at some point we

00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:16,779
want to be able to sign as it's because

00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:19,720
if you review it but you're not sure if

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:24,699
it's actually coming from certain

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:28,509
developers signing a certain advantages

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:33,519
we also want more social features so um

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:36,759
I maybe don't trust random people but if

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,239
that says wow that's a really cool

00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,369
wallpaper or really cool plasmoid or

00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:45,220
whatever that's more valuable to me than

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:47,199
random users so social features that are

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,559
pretty common in other app stores are

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,159
something on the road map as well of

00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,159
course one of the big goals is to

00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,479
actually want to see that slight right

00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,939
one of the goals is to also grow the

00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:03,220
ecosystem so we want to grow it by

00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:07,199
combining but we also want to grow it by

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,999
making it more interesting and are

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,209
combining it means bigger market a

00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:15,139
larger audience it's

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:19,850
interesting for people to contribute and

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:21,230
then one of the that's probably not an

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,899
elephant in the room but it's a very

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,470
very hot topic right now our

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:30,339
containerized applications so far as I

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:36,679
said there's more or less only add ons

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:40,369
on there but we see containerized

00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,050
applications such as snaps flat packs up

00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:47,749
images becoming more and more popular

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:51,350
and they have very definitive advantages

00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:53,959
so for application developers work for

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,059
example right now they really don't have

00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:57,829
a way to ensure that users are getting

00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:01,699
bug fixes that users are getting the

00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:04,279
latest version and the chain is just too

00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:05,929
long even if I as an application

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,189
developer ship and update and and

00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:12,559
release it then it's still up to about

00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:15,589
200 distributions to actually ship it to

00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,199
the users so being able to shortcut that

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,439
and distribute apps directly through

00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:25,429
through containers reduces the

00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:28,939
complexity and shortens the the time to

00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:31,839
market for for applications I think that

00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:34,309
is a big advantage and it's actually

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,679
missing and it's rightfully identified

00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:40,519
as one of the sore points of the Linux

00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:43,040
ecosystem so the plans for the store are

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:48,559
and those are already an experimental

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:53,329
phase is to offer containerized apps you

00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:56,660
can think of that like you start

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:58,730
discover and you can just do

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,129
distribution updates through your

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,749
package manager but you also get a list

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,720
of container right steps nice with

00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:09,740
metadata and screenshots and all that

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,750
and you can use these applications on

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,630
your system and the cool thing of course

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,299
about containerized apps is it removes

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,270
the complexity of the distribution in

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:24,889
between so you don't have to do and a

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:27,799
200 builds times six versions which is

00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:31,070
pretty much unmanageable for normal

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:33,010
human beings so this actually allows

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:38,380
application developers to get their

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:41,690
software to be clear it's not the yet

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:45,169
but it it should happen it's a big topic

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:50,029
and we should work on that and we also

00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:53,510
looked a bit about Wes that gap that we

00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:55,370
have to solve now I won't go over all

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:59,539
these points but i think this provides a

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:02,120
pretty decent overview where the

00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:05,899
software distribution and software

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:09,730
distribution mechanism of most of the

00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:12,529
current linux distributions fall short

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,580
it's pretty neat technically it's i

00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:19,159
think really awesome that you can update

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:22,610
your whole distribution and all the

00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:25,010
applications just in one go it's

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:29,630
actually really fast if you compare it

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,880
for example to Windows Update also less

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,850
rebooting and less annoyance and total

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,700
but there's not really a way for

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:41,649
developers to get feedback how many how

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:45,830
many users does my app f I had no idea

00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:49,549
the distributions do a really good way

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:54,620
to shield me from my users which on one

00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:57,770
end I welcome because the less time I

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,200
spent on triaging trivial bug reports

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,020
that are really a user problem the more

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,020
time I can spend coding or diving or

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:11,559
eating chocolate or Netflix or stuff

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:15,230
like that um and we also provide a

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:18,080
channel for donations without anyone

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:22,340
taking a slice of it so that again makes

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,520
it I think a lot more interesting for

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,899
people to spend time on that you know if

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,870
if it just gets in a few hundred bucks

00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,650
every year that's still pretty nice and

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,650
I think

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:41,690
feel more valued as people donated for

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:43,700
the content I put up I think a warning

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,980
is in place you shouldn't probably not

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,810
donate to my content if you want me to

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,860
work on Katie because I likely just

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:57,350
spending on ongoing diving so donated

00:19:51,860 --> 00:20:00,140
someone else not to me so um conclusion

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:03,500
more freedom to Katie products really

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,790
the central part of the of our software

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:11,450
is now free software 15 year old bug

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:14,930
solved good stuff revenue model for your

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,930
creations without anyone taking a slice

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,960
for this no one to rope you into because

00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,130
it's they are money with that this is

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,170
something for you and one hundred

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,680
percent for you it's a really

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,540
interesting option for application

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,060
distributions by all means please help

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,880
with that the more hence we get on it

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:40,180
the better it will be and also the

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,860
sooner it will be it's in your hands now

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,920
playing a still in the game will keep

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,450
developing it but we want to develop it

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,990
openly we want to develop it

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,670
collaboratively and i think that's it

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,670
and i'm pretty sure there are questions

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,880
so hello yeah what's the address what's

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,030
the role of distributions with this

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,400
because you've talked about suffer a

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,900
software store but we've lastly got soft

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,460
software from distributions they have

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,530
the ones who have handled updates them

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,570
to handled all of the packaging whatnot

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,970
how do you plan to play along with them

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:38,100
not to play what exactly how does this

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:42,000
work out so first of all we haven't

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,820
fleshed it out in detail but I can give

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,120
my personal view on how these things

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:52,250
could work in the future so what matters

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:57,570
to me are maybe three four applications

00:21:52,250 --> 00:22:00,809
I definitely want to run a absolute rock

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:04,049
stable version of my email client I want

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:06,570
to use the latest stable version of my

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:09,660
code editor kdevelop and then a few

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:12,690
other things that don't really matter

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,700
but I probably use about 20 30

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,630
applications regularly so an image

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,549
viewer um image viewers of two years ago

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,919
are really good enough for me I don't

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:26,160
care much about it I don't want to spend

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,780
any extra time I'll just go with it with

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,540
the default whatever my distribution

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:36,059
offers so how I see it distributions

00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:39,000
should offer the base system should take

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,640
off care of security updates and all

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,799
that but the applications I care most

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,390
about I want to use in the latest

00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:48,120
version and those are probably the ones

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:53,750
i will install from a containerized

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,750
format how does it how does it in sorry

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,690
no it said it's the applications that

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,170
are absolutely critical for my workflow

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,720
that I need tighter control on you know

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:08,450
maybe the I'm running gnome the neo

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,610
nautilus sucks for me and I'm doing file

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,550
management all the time I would like to

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:18,500
be able to you know pick a certain

00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:20,810
version for example from that so the way

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,910
I see it is that distributions provide

00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:29,150
the base system security support and and

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:31,400
all that user support but for for a few

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:34,160
applications I want to have the latest

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,170
version and how does it look like to the

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,640
user we have discover which is a

00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,560
basically a client for package

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,370
management software installation and all

00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,530
that and it will integrate on the UI

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:52,130
site so there we actually have plans to

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:55,010
integrate containerized apps in discover

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,350
so you get you get a nice UI you can

00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,350
click an install button and it will also

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:06,980
show you updates and allow to install

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:08,990
these updates other questions at some

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,430
point there you mention it vetting

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,680
contents that are not according to the

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,510
policies like it's easy to imagine not

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,060
allowing a pornographic wallpaper such

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,400
but what about malicious software put in

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,280
there that you have an reviewing process

00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:28,310
for extra code we don't have any

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:29,930
reviewing process yet at all so no and I

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:35,180
don't think there should be a central

00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:38,600
entity reviewing content because what I

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,810
would what I can imagine is that we have

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,440
a few designers who know a bit about the

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:49,280
artwork concepts we use in KD so these

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,590
designers would add some kind of tag to

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,690
certain wallpapers Isaiah these work

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:57,919
really well they don't provide enough

00:24:53,690 --> 00:25:01,110
contrast there well done

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,630
if it's photography it's technically

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,590
sound piece of work that kind of stuff

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:12,480
so they would for example add a visual

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:15,600
design group proved stamp to it but that

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,870
and we would use that tag or stamp in

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,779
the plasma is wallpaper installation

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,480
dialog to put these wallpapers first and

00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:26,370
then you'd have to click a button or

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,480
something or choose a different option

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:37,620
to see all the content so that's how I

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:41,100
imagine that 44 reviews if you get the

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,870
software from the sauce you actually

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,240
have pretty decent chance that it's

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,919
better quality I've seen it I've seen

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,870
distributions patching applications to

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,770
death and that's something i do not want

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:58,470
and then we have the signing signing

00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,570
process so there's the entry point to

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:04,860
ensuring that the software you're

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:10,950
running will be will actually be you

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:13,340
know authentic or safe or sound but yes

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:16,020
there are risks with installing software

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,260
from third parties but just in the same

00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,940
way I doubt that even Debian reviews all

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,710
of plasmas code base and they're still

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:29,549
shipping it so there's a certain level

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:32,669
of trust involved with that I just

00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:35,730
wanted to add one thing if I wanted I

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:37,830
could add malicious keep a militia thing

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,450
to Quinn which would run on every system

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,070
at nobody would notice so and no

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,919
distribution would notice no user would

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:48,570
notice so just because the code is open

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:51,140
there's no risk we're so lucky Martin is

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,140
not evil

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,230
okay you know how is the storage in the

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,899
size of bling how you actually doing

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,669
this out the files there and there's

00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:09,570
kind of possibility of a revision of the

00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:13,009
files you mean revision of the files to

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:15,179
exchange something that's on there yeah

00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:19,429
well at some level of course if you

00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:23,929
Sicily you can just remove it there I

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:28,019
have to say I haven't looked at the code

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:29,700
there is a content delivery network

00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,419
thing involved I don't know maybe

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,669
Alexander can can explain out how that

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:40,139
works or we discuss it afterwards

00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:42,769
because it's really detailed question to

00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:47,840
make it short there are three

00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:50,940
repositories first as OCS web server

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,580
which is basically the front end then we

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,629
have OCS CDN which basically is a

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,220
content delivery network part that is

00:27:56,629 --> 00:28:01,350
doing all the images screenshots and

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,649
stuff like that and there's OCS file

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,929
server so the file server is really a

00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:09,419
much more advanced than the original

00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:11,850
file server which only allowed one real

00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:14,190
fire and the other side to be links so

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:17,610
now the file server is on a separate

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:20,100
server it allows multiple files version

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,309
history it can create even torrents for

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,850
larger files if that is necessary so

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:30,269
those are the three compute repositories

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:33,779
and they are all can be found and get

00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:36,600
KDE and can be reviewed so we really

00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:39,899
welcome because of course no no

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,580
software's perfect you always find some

00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:47,279
security issues or some bugs so anyone

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:50,190
who likes to have a look and help ya can

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,269
do that and it's also listed on

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:59,820
fabricator so if you find some box on

00:28:54,269 --> 00:29:00,900
the UI or yeah you can just report it on

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,200
fabricator and we will

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:10,290
look so you you can see that i can

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,300
upload different files / / product we

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,130
have time for one last question service

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,960
will be around I'm sure the Pooh systems

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:20,520
people will be around you ask them a

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,070
question about the distribution of apps

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,250
and containerized formats so several

00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:28,620
people have done analysis of what images

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,120
are hosted on docker hub and what kind

00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,130
of problems are there and the number one

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,380
problem is not malicious code but just

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,440
outdated code where you have outdated

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,180
dependencies packaged within the apps so

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,310
i'm pretty sure that this also will be

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,020
the problem of distributing whatever

00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,850
kind of software we distribute on the KD

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,010
software store so my question is do you

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,380
have any thoughts about how to make sure

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,360
that the things which are on the KD

00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:59,240
software store actually secure for the

00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:02,990
user let's put it the other way around I

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,150
know that people don't update their

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:09,210
linux systems either that in many cases

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,180
we don't even get to ship bug fix or

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:15,090
security updates so just yesterday i was

00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,790
discussing with martin how we can get a

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,550
series of really important bug fixes not

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,830
security problems but functional

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:25,380
problems out to the user of a long terms

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,810
of support distribution and they don't

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,220
even shape our bug fix updates so i

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:34,110
think it's a this problem is bigger than

00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:39,240
this topic and we need to ask ourselves

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:41,660
how we can how we can solve it ok we're

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,660
all the time sorry that's very frank

00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,660
please

00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,460
