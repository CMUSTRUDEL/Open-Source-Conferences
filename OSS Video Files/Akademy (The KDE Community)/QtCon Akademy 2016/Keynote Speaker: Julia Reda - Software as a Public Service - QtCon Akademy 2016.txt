Title: Keynote Speaker: Julia Reda - Software as a Public Service - QtCon Akademy 2016

Description: 
	The FOSSA project to get the European Union to run open source security audits takes a step towards understanding FLOSS as a public service: If free/libre open source software belongs to the public, the public needs to take responsibility for it. Taking such responsibility – and not just
for security – is getting more and more urgent as software controls ever more of the world around us. Societies need to ask themselves: Can people be truly emancipated and governments truly independent when they cannot (or just do not) inspect and modify the code that runs their lives?
