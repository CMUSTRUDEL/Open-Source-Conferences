hello so first of all sorry about the

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,230
timing thingy we have booked a slot for

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,260
one hour but apparently just one student

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,630
is presenting because one of the other

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,269
student who wanted to present had his

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:32,510
flight delayed this is our now are now

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:35,219
worked on the dolphin and ki you this

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:38,129
google some rockport in this google sort

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:51,239
of core program and he wants to present

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:52,620
his project the to us so yeah hi

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,800
everyone i am a second-year

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,059
undergraduate student at india and my

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,640
mentors for this project by pinner

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,140
kiguchi with an gupta and to a large

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,090
extent day before even though he wasn't

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,600
a former mentor my project he helped me

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,570
out quite a lot with making this so as

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,970
the title says it's a it's to help

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,330
making discontinuous files sections

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:20,100
easier and explain how that works so

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,900
this project yeah sorry this project

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,460
came out of a problem and this problem

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,890
exists in all file managers which i

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,110
found be a dolphin not this or even the

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,170
windows file manager the problem is that

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,939
it's really difficult to select a small

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,159
subset of files in your file manager

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,750
what I mean to say is like if you want

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,970
to select some files in your file

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,290
manager you have a bunch of icons and to

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,939
select those icons you don't have any

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,860
good tools as such you can either use

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,899
ctrl a which was select all the files in

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,930
your selection or you can use ctrl +

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,090
click to select one I file at a time but

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,100
neither of those options are good for

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,869
many reasons for one thing if you have

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,549
to use ctrl + click to select each file

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,350
individually it requires fine motor

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,790
skills if you accidentally miss a click

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,750
or something you might lose your entire

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,570
file selection so with those problems in

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,640
mind I made this project and the other

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,849
problem was as I said over here is that

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,560
if you're copying a file between any two

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,830
devices you have a hard disk in the

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,170
middle

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,790
which is spinning let's say not an SSD

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,400
that's it they just say it was hard disk

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,930
just fini so when you try copying

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,370
something your hardest heart spinning

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,900
and then when you try to an aggregate to

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,790
another folder to find something else to

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,320
copy your hard disk is already spinning

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,210
and because it's a mean spinning fast

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,700
what I mean to say is copying something

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,440
and as a result of that it's slower like

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,710
it just becomes very sluggish to copy

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,450
another file so gently just copying

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,060
files between any two devices is not a

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,200
very you know good experience so my

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,000
project was to rectify all these

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,890
problems by creating something I call a

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,500
virtual folder so in this virtual folder

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,330
you can stage files what I mean to say

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,550
is that you can copy files from a lot of

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,690
different locations on any discontinuous

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,640
file tree they don't have to be in the

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,290
same hierarchy or anything you can copy

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,959
all those files to a virtual folder

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,730
which will save all your files in the

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,650
run what it means is that it's not

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,330
saving the file from the file system or

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,570
anything it's just saving the URL of the

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,340
file in a process and then you have a

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,640
selection of files which you can then

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:24,239
copy to any others any other device for

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:27,060
any other folder so these files are

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
copied they're not copy it as in the

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,180
sense you're not working the file itself

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,000
you're just copying the URL of the file

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,800
and the advantage of that is that it's

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,209
obviously a lot faster to just copy the

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,239
URL of the fencer coughing the whole

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,850
file and um that makes her files

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,420
sections of our easier I'll show you

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,040
this too so on my right I have some

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,450
actual files which are there in my home

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,489
directory and this is my project so it's

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,010
called stash let's name we've given to a

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,360
diner might change in the future and all

00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,190
these files that you see over here and

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
not actually in any folder as such

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,730
they're just pointers to real files

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,320
which are somewhere else on the hard

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,209
disk and yeah so the advantage of this

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,370
approach is that I can actually curate

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,080
my file selections on the stash ki will

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,519
save itself if I want to you know like

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,169
suppose I want only some folders in my

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,060
music directory I don't want all the

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,580
folders I can delete some of them and

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,360
then I can I can delete some of them on

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,770
the virtual file system so the

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,810
advantages artist

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,310
it's not actually touching my real file

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,650
system in deleting files from there it's

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,569
all being done virtually and I can

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,550
curate a sub like a selection of files

00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,020
on my virtual thing and then copy all of

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:46,819
the required files at once there's a

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:49,780
size and implementation so this is a KO

00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:54,590
slave-like might have used in other

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,810
things such as for foot like this at AG

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,889
scale slave which vitiation does made

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,900
over the and we have a we have que haces

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,270
for other things as well like FTP fish

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,240
and HTTP as well and compute my reviews

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,009
so um this is okay I'll say which means

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,720
it's compatible with any K application

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,970
you can use it as a plasmoid you can use

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,440
it in any other financial support scare

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,280
you you can use it in Dalston as well

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,500
obviously and how this works is that the

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,330
chaos slave is talking to a demon which

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,129
is running in the kv-5 process so this

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,520
demon is just holding the list of files

00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:34,909
and their URLs obviously and the source

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,430
files and the KO save is talking to this

00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:41,539
process using d-bus QD bus more

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,819
specifically and we're storing all the

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,289
files in something which week really

00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,000
uniquely for this project is written

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,159
into it and it's a kind of custom

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,039
virtual file system I can get to that as

00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:56,900
well so this is a small overview so you

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,539
have a cave application which can be

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,039
dolphin or the plasma into something and

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,169
it's talking to the chaos slave for

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,210
copying renaming and deleting and this

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,219
case lip is just contacting the stash

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,960
demon object which is living in the

00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:13,250
gated five process its own written over

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,169
there but it is and yeah so the so the

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,509
slave and the demon object are

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,250
communicating over T bus and the cave

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:23,960
application is just displaying whatever

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,449
the chaos slave is listening so that's

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,190
it the source code is of course open

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,460
source and you can see it if you'd like

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,490
to oh yeah does anyone have any

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,490
questions

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:44,150
how was your experience in google Summer

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,830
of Code this year it was pretty good

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,840
yeah it was a really good experience I

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,420
learned a lot about project development

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,370
and get and you know just making my

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,010
source code a lot more readable and well

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,570
documented so I would have never done

00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,860
these kind of things if and not

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:06,210
participate in the g-shock so it was a

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:10,680
very valuable experience yeah any other

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:13,980
question can I ask more than one stash

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:21,210
uh yeah sure I can actually show you how

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:23,490
this works um no you cannot actually

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:28,020
have more than one stashed as such

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,840
there's only one but you can actually

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,130
install this right now but the problem

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,660
is that we're actually waiting on a

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,980
patch in dolphin getting accepted this

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,170
is a patch version of dolphin which is

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,430
compatible with the slip otherwise there

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,300
are few plants which don't quite work

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,320
with the existing version of dodging so

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,170
with your question you can only have one

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,960
stash but you can of course have as many

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,450
files or folders as you want the

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,790
performance this is quite good like each

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,120
file staged on the stash requires only

00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:00,480
300 bytes of RAM which is mainly just

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:09,450
the URL which is about that much for

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:12,180
most files we're still working on that

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,920
because as I said we're still waiting on

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,080
Dawson getting patched for this to work

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,000
I submitted a review request we might

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,000
take some time for that to get accepted

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:29,520
yeah a virtual photo sound like an

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:33,780
interesting thing maybe not only for for

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,490
copying files but also for like I don't

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,719
know maybe I want to keep a selection

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,789
for my music distributed over or off of

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,840
my work documents that are distributed

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:47,130
or different or a virtual folder for

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,950
project

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,380
like do you plan to do you have any

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,830
other plans of with this virtual folder

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,100
concept sort of we did actually I didn't

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,660
I wasn't able to implement all of it but

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,210
one of the plans was that you could save

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:09,750
your selection so they make a selection

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:11,550
here oops so one of the plans was that

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,320
you could actually save your selection

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,410
of files to the virtual folder and then

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,420
you could vote that later on so one of

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,010
the advantages of that is that like if

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,530
you have a certain selection of files

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,150
which you want to copy in many devices

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,320
you can just load that selection at any

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,430
time and then you can copy it to your

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,900
new device it could be like you're

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,610
getting a new phone and you have some

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,100
certain songs which you want to copy to

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,890
it so instead of creating a new folder

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,290
for that kind of purpose you can have a

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,730
virtual folder instead so that would

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,410
obviously save some space on your disk

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,850
because otherwise it would be taking

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:52,140
space just to have duplicates of

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:53,190
something which already have so yeah so

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,680
we're working on getting that

00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:08,100
implemented in stuff i need the

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:11,220
questions so why didn't you use

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,320
something like like following the

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,200
low-level unix principles for example

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,870
having a hidden folder with siblings

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,640
somewhere which might be because you

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,650
said like saving selection and so on so

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,650
you would then already have this

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,540
selection as a folder of somewhere

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,760
hidden folder with siblings or something

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,650
like this so now it's like really

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,580
abstract right and your application it's

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:38,070
now only working with dolphin or so if I

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,620
want to do it and on some other tools

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,730
and I would have to implement this

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,250
virtual file system again destro yeah so

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:52,440
this is limited it's limited to KO

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,460
applications well I think obviously I

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,080
didn't implement it that way because

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,140
they didn't think of it but the other

00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,310
thing was that at least by implementing

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:05,580
as a chaos slave we have full

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,580
really with KO applications like on yeah

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,230
okay it's this video um so if you have a

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:16,510
plasmoid for example you can use this as

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:20,890
well yeah so it's mainly for compatibly

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,750
with k applications one other thing is

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,670
that if you were to copy something like

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,380
so like the other thing which we valued

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,089
in this was that you should be able to

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,650
copy you should be able to use it like a

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:34,420
normal directly like we didn't want to

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:39,820
like specially modified dolphin to get

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,260
it to work so this so with this approach

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,450
at least you can use it like any other

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,220
directory in dolphin you can have to

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,360
fight you can have to think side by side

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,779
and then copy paste vice versa I need

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,730
the questions how is this presented to

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,950
the user I mean is there an some

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,300
interface or you actually have to go and

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,880
type stash colon slash uh as I know its

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,440
own doesn't know yeah you would have to

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,560
go through the location bar and type

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,300
that we could introduce a button for it

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,650
as well preferably like we have the

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,990
split button in dolphin there could be

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:21,330
another stash button as well so we'll

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:21,330
probably get to that any other questions

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,690
so there was already a question about

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,570
like when it's available in medline

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,030
distributions and what is the reception

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,990
generally like in whatever i'm not

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:40,150
involved in KDE or community so are they

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,550
thinking okay let's just say about this

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,490
button so will this be maybe something

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,690
other people think it's valuable to

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:52,720
happen the main line version or do they

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,089
like yeah okay this might be a plugin

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,560
but it's probably not something

00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:01,150
everybody wants mmhmm yeah so we don't

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,180
have actually feedback from users yet

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,760
because this is just created but what I

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,250
did do for the g stock selection was too

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,050
I ran a few service a few user service

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,680
with people the KD community this was

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,210
fairly well received

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,279
and they're also went a long way in

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:24,830
getting my proposal accepted by KD as

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:26,810
well yeah any other questions how how

00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,000
easily is it portable to Windows or Mac

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,399
OS X you know is there anything special

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,040
to unix linux there is nothing special

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,730
special to unix or linux in this it's

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,350
written completely in cute so if you

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,209
have KO supported and some other

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,850
platforms such as mac OS x i'm not sure

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:52,279
if k was supported on OSX but if it is

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:58,370
this would work exactly the same way now

00:13:52,279 --> 00:14:28,310
any other questions ok thank you or no

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:32,140
yeah everybody I have to admit this was

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:34,940
so like not a special project like for

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,060
admitting because apparently he taught

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:42,070
me was kind of semi and maintain state

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:46,339
so we had to find a mentor forward and

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:49,510
that was like up for our admin him that

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:53,750
this was like a special project yeah

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,820
yeah so yeah this project was actually

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,410
supposed to be a below project in the

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,260
beginning like the implementation was to

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:04,089
use below to select virtual files you

00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,470
can do using extended attributes it's a

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,290
property with files on the file system

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,029
but later on we found that we actually

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,730
wouldn't need below at all so we change

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:15,730
the approach has a yeah

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:31,300
we stop I it would require some more

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:33,570
work so yeah I would definitely so yes

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:39,399
this was the one of the Chiefs off

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:42,910
project we also host our own season of

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,810
KD program and we also participate in

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:50,890
Google choline question of coal and

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:54,420
outreach program called woman so if you

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:57,820
want to mentor or if you want have some

00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,279
if you have glow some students and who

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,000
would like to participate and come to KD

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:10,420
community feel free to tell them about

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:15,000
those programs thank you for going yeah

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:22,140
we will be having a buff on Tuesday hi

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,140
I'm not sure remember sorry yeah
