Description: 
	Debugging and testing takes much of the development time. There are many tools that help in the process, but you need to know of their existrance and how to use them efficiently. In this presentation I will do an overview of the powerful tools of wireshark, strace, perf and systemtap. Then I will introduce Project Flashlight, an initiative to aggregate results of different debugging and profiling tools and then allow to look for specific events, compare between different program exections and more. All that without getting into pages and pages of log files. In the process we'll do a number of discoveries like: how many sockets does kcalc use? what changes if you run it on a different system?
