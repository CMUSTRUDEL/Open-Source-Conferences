wait i'm here to talk about the plasma

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,980
desktop quick recap for everyone who

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:18,630
doesn't know which window has focus okay

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:20,939
as upside down so what is the plasma

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,800
desktop you presumably everyone in this

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,529
room seen it it's this it's the desktop

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,550
and the panels and widgets and eps

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:36,739
invisible set them to manage your

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,850
windows about your applications and also

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,260
everything to config your system for

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,329
from your hardware and a lot of

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,969
background services who were different

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,620
keyboard layouts configuring every

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,070
possible setting and we're known for

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,760
having loss of possible settings so all

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,680
of your system configuration and also

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,710
plasma there are a lot of background

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,329
services that you don't really know

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,030
about but take for granted making sure

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,170
when you close the lid the computer to

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,530
spend making sure when you press a

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,850
volume up the volume goes up and it's

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,590
these little things that make quite a

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,229
bit of different and in terms of code

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,390
it's probably it's a roughly evenly

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,310
split between each of these four

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:26,159
components ago for goodness sake known

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:29,579
people here too in fact our talk back

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,770
room services and equally large size of

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,630
our code is all of a style and

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,850
integration we have stars and

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,369
integration for not just cute five and

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,320
our applications but also back working

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,030
out too cute for back porting up to GTA

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,990
to gtk free and also if you look for

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:53,369
your code we support TK we export all of

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:57,180
the colors used extra sources databases

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,790
so TK applications will have some level

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,549
of style and integration I don't know

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,350
how much that's used but we try and

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,340
integrate into absolutely everything

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,900
under sun to get a consistent experience

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,800
so overall plasma is everything puts you

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,800
in between

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,410
a black screen and any application no

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,390
matter where it is and being able to use

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,770
your applications out some way of

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:28,590
Casimir so last year I sit on a sage

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,280
very much like this one but not this one

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,130
would be amazing photography and and I

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,770
talks about three things I talked about

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,330
how it desktop is still relevant because

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,780
there's a lot of hype about Mobile's

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,180
last year and I talked how linux is

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,000
still relevant on your desktop and how

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,040
plasmas in a good state but if the 10

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,500
towards bigger than what we currently

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,970
have we can improve a little bit to

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,930
reach our full potential that we have

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:02,370
available so what has changed in the

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:05,190
past year in the past 12 months what

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,830
does it desktop usage I'm going to find

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,530
a new slide updated now including 2015

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,710
shows how many hours have spent using a

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,890
desktop every day and with our new entry

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:19,290
it's exactly as I end of the year before

00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,840
there's no real sign of it waving if

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,050
anything it peaked in 2011 bit us just

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,209
an abnormal blip-it desktop isn't going

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,830
away is no scientific going away if you

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,040
look at stats if you look at percentages

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,540
yes it is but that's only because people

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,610
spending more and more more time on

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,450
mobiles nor titter spending less time on

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,790
desktops so plasma as a desktop still

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,790
relevant and in terms of linux market

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,940
share fancy quote taken from slashdot

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:52,320
because slashdot are all over loving KTN

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,810
linux and linux desktop now accounts a

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,760
2.48 percent of everything in june and

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,440
that's not including phone book they've

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,270
quite a lot of research and checking out

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,600
Chromebooks don't identify themselves as

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,300
linux for some reason so linux overall

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,700
has increased over the past 12 months it

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,950
falls roughly one point nine percent now

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,930
is deadly nearly two and a half percent

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,919
of all users and in terms of absolute

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,390
uses that's millions any company would

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,940
be pleased to have that many users

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,650
obviously that's not all plasma it's

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,650
probably ninety nine percent or so

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:34,569
yes this is time spent in hours on a

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,789
computer blew his desktop green as

00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:44,379
mobile yellow is who knows folios weird

00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:46,990
kiasi fine and shopping centers but

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:50,379
desktops irrelevant linux on your

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,259
desktop still relevant so what's changed

00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,090
in plasma over years and this is nice

00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,789
montage of all different wallpapers

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,509
we've had which is it main reason these

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:03,879
slides are here so we vote the main k

00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:07,240
menu that got completely rewritten if

00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:10,569
visual theme got refreshed we've stored

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,819
the super old legacy icons and we had

00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:16,839
full brand new updates arrived in a

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:18,750
plasma 505 release and want to show how

00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,800
much disk space is used if you have

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,020
quotas enabled on your system like

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,339
Dominic a color picker for quickly

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,409
finding what colors use in their awesome

00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,930
backgrounds and bring out a switch

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,669
between users and also bring a switch

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,650
between activities quicker a lot of

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:38,139
things improving your workflow and of

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:42,879
course work on white lentil pot so I

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:45,129
have an m5 dot six more than proves

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,439
workflow again that's really our target

00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:49,569
cuz we try to put you to your apps as

00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,149
fast as possible so a task manager

00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,250
gained some features is it shows

00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,629
progress in your task manager so you

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,169
don't have to open the application to

00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:00,370
find out it's not finished yet and you

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,020
don't need to open your media player

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,550
just to go on to the next track if

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,139
you've got on random and it starts

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,080
playing britney spears in the loop or

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,969
you can go back and listen to it all

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,680
again and there's working and braylon

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,839
support that happened in five top six

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,969
continued how do we had me wrapped them

00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,830
and weather update got restored so we're

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:21,460
about to pretty much most of old apt as

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,069
we had plus new stuff the last of five

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,500
to seven continued rewriting everything

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,930
it task manager back-end got completely

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,699
rewritten task manager being the bit

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,229
that's normally at the bottom by default

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,459
choice which application you have a

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,750
system tray back end got rewritten and

00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,210
we improved a workflow

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,640
if you know k runner then everyone does

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,190
your type and it shows you search

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,350
results so you can type anything you get

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,060
results and that got improved your

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,280
workflow so you can jump directly into a

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,860
specific act activity within an

00:06:51,280 --> 00:07:01,630
application all I know some work on the

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:03,640
whaling spot that continued so 528 it's

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,370
gotta be written back enviar pager as

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,680
lots of rewriting most alexia code from

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,930
plasma for once you know what you want

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,760
the code to actually do it you can go

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,230
back and rewrite it and now something we

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,660
found in plasmas things have built up

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,070
with adding new features and it comes a

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,110
point where you have to say oh now we

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,419
know what we want we can we do it again

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,580
and this time basing it directly on

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,890
knowing will be in queue quick and we

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,080
know we've had these features I've got

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,910
new things for if you switch between

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,270
different themes you can change the

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:38,410
layout of your desktop and others and

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:41,800
welcome to Milan support so it general

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,210
themes / it past 12 months we've had

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,960
those for Willie it we've had free

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,160
releases 528 is just about to come out

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,310
because Academy is at a slightly

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,330
different time it's been no dramatic

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,850
changes we haven't had cute six and

00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,710
there's been discontinued iterative

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,479
improvement so everything's always

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,860
getting slightly better but not getting

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:09,810
worse which is always a good combo I

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:12,580
know it's improved whale in support so

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,979
coming up next five to eight is a

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,960
interesting twist on it now we're going

00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,180
to have a long-term support so instead

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,850
of just having three months of patches

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,930
it's now going to have 12 months of

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:32,080
patches 18 I wasn't sure at least 12

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:33,940
months of punches and 12 months of

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,229
patches 18 lots of support I will see

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,780
how it goes i mean it's something that

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,000
we've not really tried before even in

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,330
plasma for days when we're dealing with

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,580
six months of these cycles that was not

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,910
as long as this this is twice or three

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,110
times it's either that so that's going

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,640
to be an interesting times but also

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,220
brings in new opportunities

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,690
because we find we found one of our

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,850
particular distributors and I think

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,340
you're going to find in Munich that you

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,900
don't want more and Fremont and support

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,880
because you don't want now Grove

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,070
upgrading every three months and it's

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,120
really a sign of maturity that we're now

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:13,390
able to say we can offer 18 months of

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,980
support and not get too stressed about

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,220
it well if we did that for platter

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,520
earlier versions of plasma I don't think

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,450
any one of us would have been as excited

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,290
we would have missed out on a lot of

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:29,800
waving support but Wayland is not part

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:35,190
of a plasma 50 out eight out long 20 LTS

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,190
long-term support 18 months being long

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,070
so with a knee slide presentation it's

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,280
always good to find some stats because

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,610
it shows I've done teen research in the

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:56,410
last 12 months 194 fouls and lines have

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:59,710
changed which is quite a lot over 8,000

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:03,040
commits which again so quite a lot a

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:09,100
verge is out my maths are correct 26 a

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,540
day that's yeah but including internet

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,440
was in a branch and then merge into

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:18,730
master yeah yeah it short log basically

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,760
on a master branch and this is something

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,970
I think is quite encouraging 146

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,230
different contributors in all of the

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,390
plasma work modules which in the past

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,670
year there's only last last 12 months

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,300
but it does include scripty rich is a

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:42,610
bot so but scripture is one of our best

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:45,820
developers so as an encoding design it

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,790
shows plasma is 11 it shows 145

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,100
different people were able to set up

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,010
plasma in a development build and start

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,900
contributing changes and that's probably

00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,420
a biggest challenge we have in plasma is

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:02,920
this set up to begin contributing so

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,880
it's not about today owncloud in its

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,920
peak was around 300 but

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,310
other projects which are successful and

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,100
they have considerably less so it's not

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:18,410
it could be better but definitely not

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:21,050
bad not bad at all 1092 bugs marks is

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,600
resolved fixed so we've actually made a

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,220
change to close something we haven't

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,950
just said I don't care about your

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,910
problem we've made us change and fixed

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,970
1082 bugs which is pretty encouraging

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,630
because I don't think we've introduced

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,910
anywhere near 1080p bucks and overall

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,150
we've closed just over 3,000 that's

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,850
including solving people's problems

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,100
without a code commits may be pointing

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,520
them in the right direction or it being

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,920
a duplicate or in some cases disagreeing

00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,040
with user but are still a net increase

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:02,630
but it shows generally things are going

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,000
quite well so I'm talk a bit about what

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,980
makes writing a desktop hard because we

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,530
see quite a lot particularly over the

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,630
last couple of years of new desktops

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,780
coming along and we're going to be a

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:18,500
great new desktop why is it hard to

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,240
write it desktop well you have

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,250
integration with completely different

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,660
distinct components if you write an

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,320
email client you're going to be an

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:31,040
expert in I'm up and maybe smtp not a

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,170
lot of things tight plasma we need

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,620
experts in pulseaudio we need experts

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:42,370
insistently we need experts in spell

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,370
checking for a word completely

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,390
and I'm still shaking again you have all

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,880
of these different layers that comment

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:59,640
but it'll quiet different skills for

00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:01,110
proofreading to here to reviewing but

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,820
but also all your different light waves

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,640
and the form of your more thing to

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,890
depend on is big chain from any graphic

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,900
driver to your spell checking libraries

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:13,130
and we have an abstraction layer over

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,540
three different ones or in my case none

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,210
we have all of the different things in

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,029
any wall of them fails plasma seems like

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,300
it sucks so we need people with a wide

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,970
variety of skills and that's hard to get

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,680
so as more external dependencies both

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,140
explicitly and implicitly and most other

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,610
pieces of software and that makes

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,960
writing a desktop hard and want to tell

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,000
a story of something that happened over

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,770
the last 12 months with this video

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,680
legacy support for many many systems

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,180
warm examples X session management a

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,490
next session management is a thing at

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,770
the stores or applications after you

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,370
shut down and come back in it was an old

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:57,959
protocol we dropped from client side at

00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:02,910
start of KD 2 it's so old that is

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:06,060
predaceous bicycles it's its point of

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:09,240
reference for most things and we don't

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,520
need anymore there's no way we need that

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,089
velcro so we dropped it because it's a

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,130
clean up and in theory any application

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,770
to better speak a new language which we

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,810
support one month later we ended up

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,029
putting it back because applications

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:28,470
still used it and we've got reports on

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:31,140
it and that's something nearly 10 15

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,450
years old we still have to support at

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,959
the same time we've always constant new

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:38,760
things to support system d decided to

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,130
change its behavior of what happens when

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,720
you close a lid previously plasma

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,160
handled it as plasma job and plasma

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,370
could check in figuration option and

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,640
decide oh I've shut down or all the

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:53,130
users said they want to stay open but we

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,640
have a new code of paths decided no I

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,260
know best and facts to of

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,390
mostly new system they log in d and

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,270
we've got new graphic changes we have

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,130
their weight and support we have new

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,720
things and we have as legacy old things

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,670
and that just means we're continually

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,560
growing and growing and growing and that

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:16,880
makes it all so very hard for a brand

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,880
new desktop to try and catch up so

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:26,580
they've definitely correct opinions on

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,640
the future so it used to be a rule of

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:33,450
thumb and computing that every I don't

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:37,530
to say how many months now see I thought

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:40,890
it was 12 and 18 months the speed of a

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:43,290
computer with double and that lasted

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,480
true for ages that's kind of stopped now

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,550
particularly on the desert side and it's

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,580
gone backwards now we have this demand

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,480
for this particular computer here was

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,160
given away free on a magazine in the UK

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,020
not an increase twice of a magazine this

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,940
was free on the front of a magazine a

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:06,390
computer and that's now almost as

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,530
standard and it's not faster it uses are

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,290
getting faster and faster hardware

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:13,950
getting cheaper hardware and expecting

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,300
our software to run on it so our normal

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,520
expectations of we can use these new

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,440
things we can create increasing in

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,650
memory and run because computers allow

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,790
it we're actually going backwards and if

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,350
anything we're now trying to support

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,710
computers with less resources than we

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:34,230
were a couple of years ago which is

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:36,300
interesting and android desktop is

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,030
definitely coming we know else coming in

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,830
a cup of years what impact is that going

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,160
to have on plasma if they're going to

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:46,650
take away some of our users personally I

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,870
don't think it will I mean I wrote some

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,510
software to be run up android

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,160
application on a desktop and really

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,900
there wasn't much demand because

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,970
anything of an Android application also

00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,210
has a really good website which normally

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,430
works better and i think is it going to

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,720
take away users who would have voice

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,470
wait two chrome balls taking away your

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,850
windows users because we kind of have a

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,860
market of nerds I don't think that's

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,439
changing

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,890
but it's something to be wary of it's

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:22,160
going to take shape change the shape of

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:23,809
desktops over the next few years and all

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,059
the thing that's big to talk about it's

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:29,840
a slapstick article recently KD is dying

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,820
and that's not true in terms of

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,210
community or just showing plasmas doing

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,820
quite well but we've had with marketing

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,070
changes there is no KDE anymore we have

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,600
a distinct plasma we have applications

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,630
and we have a framework and they're

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,760
pitching in different directions and

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,809
this is good if I were an application I

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,780
would want to try and reach as many

00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,520
people as possible it makes sense

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,640
however it changes the way think we do

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,730
things in KDE now if we had a new idea

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,880
for a crazy tech like activities to some

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:05,210
extent or Clio if you a remote file

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,980
system we can't do a KD level anymore

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,440
and then just change as an entire suite

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,570
of applications to match for two reasons

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,490
partly because our applications want

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,460
lowest common denominator to run

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,100
everywhere and partly because our plasma

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,830
users a lot of the application day use

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,660
now and now on your web it's not a KD

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,510
application for doing every single task

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:29,299
even playing music you do it in the web

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:32,059
now a lot of people a lot of tasks

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:34,790
straight into a web and we have limited

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:38,299
control over the two big web giant's

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,220
Firefox and chromium and that change the

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,919
way we do things in plasma means we have

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,710
to target slightly lower levels we're

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,080
seeing out now phone on did some change

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,990
crazy ideas of how sound gets routed and

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,299
we did that at a lively level now we're

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,660
we saw in five seven five to eight we're

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:58,429
improving our talking to pops audio

00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,370
which is at a slightly lower level

00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,590
beneath KDE and we're plasma is

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,630
improving our integration now and that's

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,690
not necessarily a bad thing it improves

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:13,549
desktop homogeneity our desktop stop

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:17,480
behaving similar Lily but it's a change

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:21,090
out we're having in plasma so

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,580
wrapping up conclusions it's a list of

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,980
relevant littlenecks is still relevant

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,570
under desktop a plasma is in a good

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,240
state over the last 12 months we've seen

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,090
very encouraging changes we've seen a

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
good amount of control contribution

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,360
things are heading in a generally

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,640
positive direction but it still has more

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,640
potential than we're currently reaching

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:48,080
yes there's a little microphone

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,080
somewhere in case I can't hear you

00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:02,580
dropping dropping things so I tendons

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,710
here and focusing on high level I think

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,040
it's been a theme particularly stuff

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,090
high has done on getting you to your

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,620
applications I think that's very

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,000
important or jump action changes I think

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,540
that's very important and I was very

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,250
good and one thing I think we'll see

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,870
well my favorite applications that i use

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:27,480
is something called nivola birth player

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:29,520
and what it is is a webview but it by

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,740
default loads either Spotify or google

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,310
play music or diese and it has a very

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,250
tiny bit of JavaScript that turns

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,330
Empress into irrelevant changes on your

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,030
desktop so all of the plasma

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,400
functionality all of our application

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:48,020
integration still works even though it's

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,310
a web client and I think of something up

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,470
over the next few years something might

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,080
see in various other applications it's

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:58,530
something that we can control and it

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,810
allows plasma to be useful to people

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,700
because it's getting in to your content

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,320
even no matter what platform it is

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,880
because we used to do that for you to

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,010
get people to air content even it's on

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,050
gtk we need to focus on getting people

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:14,040
to your content even if it's on your web

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:15,570
and our bookmark handling code in the

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,320
start menu and runners that hasn't

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:21,590
changed in 10 years and there must be

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,640
room for improvement now see the

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:28,680
integration between the desktop or

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:31,010
workspace and the applications agree we

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,080
can do a lot better

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:37,250
everything around that is works pretty

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:43,560
well yep we can do more to poke into

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:46,950
interrupted nations metadata work we

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,890
started for the dynamic window

00:21:46,950 --> 00:22:01,110
decoration some people may know it and

00:21:49,890 --> 00:22:03,150
actually I kanya mm you question sir I

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,210
think the mix knock out ya know it's

00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:13,410
working first question was the president

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:17,610
Adan valent no second question that the

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:22,140
back numbers include the recent closing

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:25,800
sessions I did I know then every number

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:30,650
are probably 100 up ok Martin wants to

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:34,020
show off how good he is I know and ya

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:36,630
can't go question I don't know how long

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,600
I've got ok if you had like a million

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:42,750
dollars and you could just pump it into

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:47,930
a few things on plasma what would you

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,930
have people focus on well swimming pool

00:22:50,789 --> 00:23:03,789
no it's a tough question yeah we know

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,159
yeah auditing of our code is important I

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:08,379
mean as we're going to see Wayland

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,710
allows applications to be son boxed

00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:14,409
however that's only as good as the

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,029
surrounding software it doesn't do

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:18,099
anything by itself it requires our

00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:20,379
software to Matt and it's not just a

00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:22,840
whaling part is because as wailing to

00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:24,999
secure we can no longer use excuse or

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,700
exited insecure we can't do anything and

00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:30,580
we're going to see the weakest component

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,590
get shifted about because the weakest

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,239
component is not X okay that means a

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,009
week as component is now is which means

00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:38,049
a week is components are 36 out there

00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,999
will be a new weakest component and I

00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:44,470
mean security auditing and security

00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:48,629
auditing is requires expertise at is new

00:23:44,470 --> 00:24:00,519
and it's not a very fun texted ask

00:23:48,629 --> 00:24:02,349
anyone else I for question from the

00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,349
perspective of the company i'm working

00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:06,789
for so we we have a lot of linux users

00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:08,200
actually almost everybody in the

00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,559
company's using linux we are probably

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,700
one of the few bigger companies where

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,289
everybody including sales people in

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,979
management and so on are using Linux

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:20,229
tell my company probably have to say

00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:22,479
that's perfect what I'm saying is we

00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:24,849
have a lot of enthusiastic linux users

00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:27,580
and we also have a lot of enthusiastic

00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:29,169
KDE users but I've seen over the last

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,389
couple of years that actually people

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:35,049
have switched them right away from KDE

00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:38,769
and what I hear is the number one reason

00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:40,419
for that was almost always stability it

00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:43,149
was never lack of integration with the

00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:46,029
web or lack of new features or lack of

00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:47,590
whatever it was mostly about I updated

00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,509
and something stopped working so i

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:53,499
switched to something else whatever it

00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:56,019
is so my question would be on what

00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:59,889
position is stability in the list of the

00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,779
priorities of the plasma team i as a

00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:02,620
team hopefully lots of different people

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,260
from lots of different and

00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,460
hunters so i can't speak on behalf of

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,350
everyone not going to tell our

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,350
contributors stop working on new

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,590
features because we want to do this

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:17,770
personally I mostly do bug fixing I'm

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,320
Ted of any new features particle is as

00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,720
part of my employment is working on

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,760
making sure my bosses distribution is

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,680
awesome everyone should use net winner

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:32,650
elephant and so we've been up is

00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,080
something I saw me feel again about and

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:38,950
we've got a plasma LTS which of the you

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:43,840
guys influenced and that's going to help

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:44,890
my finger improve our perception so I'd

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,290
like to think we're working on it

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:51,340
obviously we'll only see how it acts in

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:53,429
a couple of years but also we are losing

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,950
communication between a difference

00:25:53,429 --> 00:26:21,220
between frames and applications can be

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:25,450
difficult yes don't have to wait until

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,309
it's too late to get feedback um I can

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,600
get it the next day after I fix

00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:33,910
something I can't stress how important

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,840
that is to me because our software

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:43,090
distribution mechanisms they suck so

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:46,840
badly that imaginary a user installs a

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:50,620
half year old release of opensuse we get

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,820
feedback okay it's a it's a version

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,800
which let's say four point seven point

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:59,110
four so we got one more chance to

00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,240
actually put a patch in a stable branch

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:05,740
which is still never going to be shipped

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,020
by opensuse so that's not helpful for us

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,570
so either we need to get the

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:15,650
distributions to ship at least our

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:18,500
stable updates or preferably even

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:22,690
updates but we need to improve our

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,690
stability and quality and regression

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,780
problems for that or we need to be

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,360
better with testing that before and then

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,400
the truth is probably somewhere in

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,790
between but from my point of view I can

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,910
say that it helps a lot to have daily

00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:43,640
builds and people I can actually point

00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,770
to something concrete they can test and

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,660
not say yeah I'm I've committed the

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,620
patch and the next time we talk about

00:27:47,660 --> 00:28:13,370
that is in eight months so I guess

00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:33,230
that's going to have an impact waiting

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:46,520
it can I interrupt for a second column

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:48,590
on the stage with me we do have a plasma

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,390
buff starting on Monday in the morning

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:56,600
and you can find that when the Academy

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:59,990
website so i also want to just answer

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,360
the question from a goon perspective so

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,120
one would expect that for example all

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,920
those wayland work goes into well the

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,080
killed quality goes down but the

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,390
opposite of the case because we are now

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,180
able to auto test what we were never

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:16,610
able to do before and I filled up a test

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,290
coverage of the grim crore of now about

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,300
fifty percent probably higher because

00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:24,080
both KDE toes or cannot test everything

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,510
yet and that's just it changes so much

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,380
if you are able to I have this weird

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,570
condition if this window has

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,370
X property and that one set then this

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,070
code part is taken and now we can

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:40,580
simulate everything and save the quality

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,580
goes up thanks to Wayland for X on X

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:50,970
because we we could never rely ibly

00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:53,580
start a full-featured x server on in an

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:56,700
auto test situation and now we're doing

00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:03,860
it all the time I actually do it 55

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:03,860
times in the same auto test so ads yeah

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:17,010
yeah I just want to reply also to you

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,390
and so from blue systems perspective

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:23,550
this is the number one priority was to

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,920
the employees working on plasma plasma

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,650
desktop of the parts that we have to

00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,750
stabilize the things that are there

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,150
first before we introduce new things

00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,190
that are half-baked and this is not

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,350
because of netrunner natrona is the

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,440
highest upstream but it goes for debian

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:45,390
ubuntu neon all the stacks in between so

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:48,330
i always am very glad when people report

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:51,240
that they have much more stable version

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:54,150
on suzhou on chaos Manjaro where plasma

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:59,370
is used so this is the most important

00:30:54,150 --> 00:31:03,950
form of blue systems perspective ok mine

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:08,340
was just a very quick remarks again

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:15,090
about the stability issue and perceived

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:18,660
quality problems one what one of the

00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:23,910
problems that often happens is is not of

00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:29,130
course not the only one but there are

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:31,950
also problems beyond our our side also

00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:36,240
on lower levels of stock it could maybe
