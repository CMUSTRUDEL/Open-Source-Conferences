Description: 
	At the Randa Meetings 2015 we held a BoF about organizing KDE or general developer sprints and the interest was quite huge so let's do this here again. With the experience of organizing 7 Randa Meetings I'd like to invite people to listen to this how to and stand right there to answer questions.

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:13,219
good morning for the fewer people we

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,660
have the more interactive we can do it

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,250
it's not the worst case for me i already

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,160
had just one in the audience so it was

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,980
really a nice interactive talk for the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,810
people who know me that you know that i

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,670
say good morning all the time for the

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,820
people who don't know me I'm Mario from

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,800
Switzerland I organized since bit more

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,290
than seven years around our meeting sets

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,610
a meeting in the middle of nowhere in

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,870
the Swiss Alps actually it's not

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,050
geographically it's quite in the middle

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,239
of Europe and we are close to the

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,879
Italian border we are in the French port

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,379
and we speak German there but when we

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,780
have the hacking meetings we speak

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,160
English here so it's quite not in the

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,370
middle of nowhere let's if you have read

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:09,090
that intro text about this presentation

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:11,880
it's a bit about historical review of

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,100
what what we did in Randolph for the

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,830
last seven or eight years and a thing

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,810
for you to motivate to organize Sprint's

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,220
yourself we had last year a nice

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,210
discussion around at the rundown

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,820
meetings we made a short both about how

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,520
to organize sprints there's a thing in

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,530
KD that in the recent years we had fewer

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,030
Sprint's you're in the years and I think

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,009
it would be something that would really

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,640
nice if we have more strains in the

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,920
future so in general in the following 25

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,079
or 20 minutes if you have any questions

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,899
or if you have anything to tell please

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,770
do it during the talk and don't wait

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,770
till the end of the top

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:15,540
anyway okay how it started rundown

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,239
meetings are me know a quite big so i

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,269
would propose start small go step by

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,290
step every year a bit more or stay

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:27,150
stable that's quite ok as well i think

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,340
personally to people for a weekend

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,610
working on some KD or free software

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,620
stuff are already a sprint doesn't need

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,450
to be just about code you can write some

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,690
documentation you can do some artwork

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,549
you can do other stuff promo work is

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,450
important as well communicational stuff

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:49,799
do it and get some people invited to

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,660
your place that's already spring in

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,849
between my slides with some tips about

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,299
how to do sprints and what what to look

00:02:53,849 --> 00:03:01,829
for you will find some pictures of

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:05,340
recent rundown meetings i hope i didn't

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:08,430
take too many embarrassing pictures we

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,340
see here first version of the rundown

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,250
meetings back then it was some actually

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,889
it started this way i use KD software

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,910
free software for quite some time and i

00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,769
wanted to give something back I studied

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,900
Computer Sciences in my minor but I

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,049
don't think I'm the best developer and

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,430
don't write the most brilliant code so i

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,290
searched another way to give something

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,420
back and i tried it with the desktop i

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,760
use so i got in contact with the plasma

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,590
people you see the plasma founder

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,260
errands I go is there and a lot of other

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,700
people who are meanwhile some of them

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,380
meanwhile disappeared some came back and

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:54,120
David Edmondson is missing for example I

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:56,579
think they're still and I got in contact

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,620
with them and I proposed to them hey

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,750
guys you could come to my place I have a

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,440
nice holiday holiday house in the middle

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,959
of the Swiss Alps and I would cook for

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,030
you I would give you some electricity I

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,250
tried to find some internet connectivity

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,380
there and you

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,829
some places to sleep why don't you come

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,430
there and heck they're a bit and after I

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,290
think a half year or a year finally the

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,480
occasion came and we found a date that

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,790
fitted for everybody and the people

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,610
arrived in Rhonda and everything started

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,320
you see it's quite small you don't see

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,590
our Charlotte as a holiday house there

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,040
but it's we had around 20 people in a

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,000
house normally normally you have four to

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:45,090
six people there regularly we had not

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,090
fled nearby where some of the people

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,090
slept and we ate ate together I cooked

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,180
for them everybody almost everybody did

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,100
the bread during this week if you look

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,370
close that's the former plasma logo

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,150
there and you see Aaron working there

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,030
that was the living room during the week

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,070
mostly crowded instead my job was mostly

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,460
as I said cooking and from time to time

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:16,680
I needed to go downstairs and re-insert

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:19,320
the fuse what's quite nice in Ronda is

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,780
acceptance in the middle of nowhere but

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,600
you have a lot of you can have a lot of

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:28,229
relaxing time we can do some nice hiking

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,360
you can do some damn building together

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,220
in the rivers although I told these guys

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,979
don't do it there because it's dangerous

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,390
and actually I think five minutes after

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,190
they came up of the bed the water came

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:46,680
so it was lucky that we still have

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:49,410
plasma that was the first version and we

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,169
had some visit to stare as well Miriam

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,270
and Mork from Emma Rock were back then

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,280
there and thought it's nice we could do

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,680
something the next year as well it

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,510
worked really well it was really

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,630
inspiring and really productive there

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,970
but when my parents saw their living

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:10,500
room they told me okay Mario once and

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,960
never again so we needed to find a

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,360
bigger house

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,580
in general if you want to do a sprint

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,710
the logical one of the logical first

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,200
steps is choose a topic something that

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,360
interests you in free software

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,360
development you mostly say I'm search a

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,610
niche you want to scratch or a project

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,580
you use very often or a project of

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,700
course doesn't seem doesn't need to be

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,889
like for me that you're not yet involved

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,650
in a project you can already be involved

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,000
in a project and then you just search

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,470
other people who are interested in this

00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:00,490
topic and you find a place and a time

00:06:47,470 --> 00:07:03,580
where you meet so this was too many

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,500
slides there was a second version of the

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,030
rundown meetings what's the first time

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,940
in the big house it's actually the

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,990
biggest house in town even bigger than

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,479
the church which are mostly the biggest

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,160
buildings in town it's quite an old

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,290
building and it's amazing how many

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,780
people of Europe were already there in

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:27,310
their childhood a lot of classes were

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:31,030
there we could use it we rented it for a

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,890
week we had back then and actually this

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,740
year it was a good friend of mine who's

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:38,950
a professional chef who cooked for us

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,680
with mostly the aerial air is famous for

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,810
their good nice weather and we had time

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,320
for a barbecue there as well this

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:51,160
mountain some of you might recognize is

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,289
the Matterhorn the nobody knows or

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,940
nobody outside the KD in free software

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,120
community knows about run doyle's has

00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:01,450
less than 400 people there but there's a

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,610
very famous touristic City nearby that

00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,530
sir matt with the Matterhorn very

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,470
touristy means very expensive as well so

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:12,970
we mostly make a short travel there but

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:15,160
i think we ok we can afford it here but

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,669
we can't really afford to go to Sir Matt

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,449
for such meetings this house is really

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,090
nice it has

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:28,129
capacity of up to 100 people which we

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:31,080
don't want to reach we we had of around

00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,849
between 40 and 60 people in the in the

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,130
last year's which is quite nice we have

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,139
still space in the house for the case

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,719
it's raining where you can go to two

00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:43,139
other rooms and where we have the

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,019
possibility to go a bit away we have a

00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:50,279
big room under roof there we're mostly

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,779
the people are back then I don't know if

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,050
you see where well that was the internet

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,329
connection that year so we tried to find

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,149
out if dsl is working there and we were

00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:06,240
ripping off of the cables out of the

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:11,670
walls and it worked ok for the week as I

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:14,459
said we always we'd if you if you live

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,850
for a week under the same roof eat under

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:21,329
the same roof heck under the same roof

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:24,720
all the time you need some some hours to

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,519
go out and do something else and does we

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,699
always have a social event when we go to

00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:33,149
Sir Matt major and we went we went there

00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:36,360
to watch closely there or not so closely

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:39,269
the matterhorn if the clouds were not

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,060
there or we offered for the people who

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:47,269
want to date a hike back for like three

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:50,130
hours and people really liked it I think

00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:52,970
in the first year we had a multimedia

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:57,389
and EU and educational people there and

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,790
I think multimedia is somehow meanwhile

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:03,360
part of the infrastructure of the run da

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:07,019
meetings that's the thing you need as

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,540
well I mean you need place it depends on

00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,699
the size you're organized you need some

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,610
kind of infrastructure the electricity

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:17,310
of course Internet connectivity food

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,100
mean most of the springs are organized

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,279
the way that people stay that's the next

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,589
one accommodation at a place the hotel

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,030
or a hostile nearby zone but there's not

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:31,990
everything under one roof

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:34,720
and then you don't really need to care

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,430
about food or restaurants nearby if you

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,510
are in the middle of nowhere you need to

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:43,450
have somebody who cooks and you need to

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,730
get the people there but that's mostly

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:52,600
not a problem to find somebody

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:56,680
interested there we see the rundown

00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:00,670
meetings in the year 2000 elf 11 in the

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,220
background you see a picture with some

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,470
drilling machines that was the year when

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,170
we decided at the former year I didn't

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,180
find a picture we had a lot of cables

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,820
hanging through a staircase so not just

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:17,350
the internet connection was quite

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:20,230
dangerous to walk by but we wanted to

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:25,030
fix this and as we saw that the rundown

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,920
meetings come make sense people like to

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,890
come there and we probably will continue

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,130
for some more years we asked the owners

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,260
of the of the house if they'd like to

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,850
provide us the hardware and we would

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:42,220
wire the house for them that means some

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,210
months before the rundown meetings would

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:49,630
happen we I organized does a smaller one

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:51,670
quite big drilling machines wave ruler

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:56,770
like this one because the walls that's

00:11:51,670 --> 00:12:00,160
as I said how's this 150 years old we

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,800
need to drill quite big holes it was an

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,880
experience I'd like to have only one in

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,640
my life but that one is now that we have

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,880
the whole house wired we have Wi-Fi

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,770
through the house we have Ethernet

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:22,990
connections in the house and I just need

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:24,730
to push a button in theory what can

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,770
happen in Ronda are there's always the

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,300
question before the new participants

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,760
come to run though is what was the

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,940
temperature like so that's the weather

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,040
on the first of June they're normally

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,740
summer but that can happen so we had

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,579
really am five centimeters of snow for

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,910
like two hours on this day

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:49,299
under the roof we started then as well

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,129
that if you have that's thing of the

00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:54,279
rundown meetings as well we have mostly

00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:56,980
different groups there some of them work

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,290
more in parallel but we tried to use

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,980
those energies that people tell each

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,779
other what they are doing so we tried we

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,850
always try to avoid that people go home

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,919
and realize hey this guy would have been

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,639
there David for could have fixed my buck

00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:16,569
why didn't I ask him so we have

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,119
different presentations up in the big

00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:21,399
room and send something like two or

00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:23,410
three years ago we record them as well

00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,439
so the people outside can watch them

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,139
afterwards as well and if you're ever

00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,179
near by this house which won't probably

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:34,769
happen up until you come to rundown

00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:34,769
meetings you can use the Wi-Fi for free

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,379
so legal matters that's the story you

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:45,480
want to me by the way there there's the

00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:47,529
president of our association and we or i

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,949
searched some people to found an

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,540
association for around our meetings

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:55,199
simply because i wanted to get some

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,919
legal responsibilities from my shoulders

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,689
there was a time around this time I

00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,579
first met my wife meanwhile we have two

00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:07,509
kids so my responsibilities in life

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:11,110
changed a bit that was the year in 2012

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:13,569
i think when we had at first 20 people

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,269
from india who wanted to come so I was

00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:18,759
used to invite them right and people who

00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,429
need a visa invite them so they at a

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,220
simple procedure to get their visa and

00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,169
then one day I got a call from the

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,600
embassy of Mumbai and they call me hey

00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:31,899
what's wrong door meetings what are you

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,529
doing there why do you invite people are

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:37,059
you aware that your responsibly

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,249
responsible for every person thirty

00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,980
thousand euros if they're disappear in

00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:46,209
Switzerland or Europe and then I started

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:51,419
to count okay 600,000 oh it's not my

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:53,739
normal budget I think year before it

00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,000
already started in a more positive way

00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:57,870
that we gotta

00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,370
a big the biggest Swiss

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,230
telecommunication company Swisscom that

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,030
sponsored us quite an amount of money

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,680
and all the money went through my

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:11,170
personal account which yeah I'm mostly a

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,380
trustworthy person but I prefer if the

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:18,850
amounts raised that somebody takes an

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:21,310
eye on it and so in 2012 we found it the

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,460
rundown meetings Association which is by

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,500
the way now a community partner of kevu

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,610
we will announce it soon in the next

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,130
days so in general to go back to the

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,730
smaller Sprint's you will organize I

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,940
think mostly it's not a problem legally

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,250
that you should worry I mean you can

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,130
have people that need a visa but KETV

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,990
will help you they have quite an

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,820
experience in it they can write

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,950
invitation letters we have some

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,590
experience now as well C Mon dated for

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,540
quite some years and there is help all

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,570
over the place and I mean the great

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,870
Kenny who does a lot of organizational

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:12,210
stuff for KD can share his experience as

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:16,780
well that's 2012 the participation rate

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,000
was more or less stable i think 2011 was

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,250
still now the biggest one there was the

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,930
platform 11 sprint which is now known as

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:30,220
k a 5k d frameworks 5 a lot of it a lot

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,070
of it was done in ronda em what mostly

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,200
interesting is to see how the group's

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,970
work there in Ronda I mean different

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,589
groups have different styles and working

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:45,010
normally we has to organizers don't push

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:47,050
any any directions on this so we just

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,300
offered the infrastructure that people

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,060
can use it and organize themselves but

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,550
it's interesting to see groups that in

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,130
the worst case and that happens almost

00:16:53,550 --> 00:17:00,010
never people are sitting right beside it

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,920
besides each other and still do IRC

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,929
although they are face to face there but

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,360
mostly you see people are really using

00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:10,510
the infrastructure so they are

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,630
discussing using postdates and doing

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:16,059
convent style discussions then split up

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:20,049
in groups used rooms that we have there

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:23,020
go outside without the computers just do

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:28,179
a hike get some inspiration come back in

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:32,140
the evening probably a.m. do some coding

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,780
and there's really amazing work going on

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:40,090
I always said people outside that are

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:44,230
really finding astonishing how how the

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,600
own motivation and the will to spare

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:52,419
their free time it's amazing how much

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:54,400
work gets done and it's somehow set to

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:57,280
see some how satisfying to see that

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,770
people leave Rhonda not relaxed but they

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,870
need another week of holidays to get

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:07,090
back to a new energy here we see back

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,760
then that was the accessibility group I

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,500
think this guy was from Nome so we try

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,650
to bring other projects to run though as

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,570
well I mean the problem or no problem

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,970
from my side is that I have the best

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,520
connections in katy door no most people

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:26,110
and but i always try to bring other

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,260
people I mean the KE accessibility group

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,610
had had great contact with techno

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,429
accessibility guys I think the year

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,559
before we had some known guys as well

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:39,940
video lon with Jean Baptiste camp was

00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:43,120
there already and I heard that Audrina

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,160
adrian is trying to bring some more

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,500
other projects to run down some more

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,500
work for us there which is good

00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:01,210
financial matters mostly you have some

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:04,230
costs costs in some way I think at the

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,700
start if you're not some local people on

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,570
the same country you will have costs

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,670
like bringing people to your country

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:16,120
which is a place as well where KETV

00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:18,910
helps quite a lot and is amazing at

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,050
least from my experience we always had a

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,730
good connection with KD KD v board to

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:28,800
solve these problems and get people to

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:32,350
the country other stuff can be that you

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,290
don't want to spend your own food

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:40,200
reserves and want some money for the

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:43,390
food and I think that's something that

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,510
ktv can help you if you need help but

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,520
the further you go with your sprint the

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:52,300
more of new organized it you will find

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,940
local supporters you can tell companies

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,490
in the local area you should use new

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,500
local newspapers radio to tell people

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,910
about what's happening there mostly

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,160
they're at least a few people who are

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,590
interested in rhondda we tried it with

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,020
the open day in the recent years the

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,600
people could come to our house for a day

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,090
and take a look over our shoulder and

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,900
see what we're doing there and why do

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:19,830
people from Brazil to Peru and India

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,750
come for a whole week to Rhonda and

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:35,050
bring 50 more people to a population of

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:38,650
350 that's 2014 you might see some

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:40,960
people you recognize some other people

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:44,460
we had that was the year I think with

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,590
with most of the families there what we

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,380
what at least I heard from from people

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,200
coming to run da people who finished

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,360
your studies and universities started to

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,420
work they needed to decide between

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,070
should I go to a que te sprint or should

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,740
I spend the time with my family on

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,800
summer holidays and that was something I

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,370
thought I could solve their somehow

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,040
because it

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,809
nice place for families there as well so

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,630
why don't these people bring their

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:17,920
families along with them and that worked

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:21,040
quite well I mean I brought oops brought

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:26,260
my family there as well I need to

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:28,600
produce some more helpers and there were

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,570
quite some people over the recent years

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,780
abroad FML with them and as I said we

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,620
don't fool fill the house during the

00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,800
week we always have some rooms free and

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:45,190
of course KDE doesn't pay their travel

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,559
or dare stay there but but compared to

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,540
zermatt or other places in Switzerland

00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,390
we can offer quite cheap accommodation

00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,870
and food there and I think from the

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,500
feedback people liked it and below you

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,940
see I think this was the first year that

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,309
we know good water from Chicago was

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:12,610
there and he did some life testing with

00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:14,230
my son who really liked it for me and I

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,360
think in general if you like to do

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,730
organizing it's it's it's really fun and

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,460
joy of organizing because you have to do

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,520
so so many different things I mean in

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,730
Rondo it's actually I I do a hotel for a

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,490
week I do everything from taking care of

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,970
the toilets see that the chef is doing

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,950
some food to internet connectivity

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,730
internet connectivity stuff see that

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:42,070
people arrived seated people find

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,650
contact there and see that people find

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,600
their way way back home so it's really

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,720
quite diverse what you're doing there

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:54,010
but nonetheless it's it's a lot of work

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,860
and the further your event will grow the

00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,440
more work there is but it's another

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,600
thing I think it's very important to

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,150
keep the fun and joy in organizing this

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,900
and take a look at yourself take care of

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:10,860
yourself maybe if it's too much or I

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,660
didn't tell there was one year in this

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,940
the first one da meetings were in 2009

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,679
so we had the opportunity if you come

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,200
back to do eight rundown meetings in

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,750
2013 I personally

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,590
need to cancel it because my wife an

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:28,029
accident where she where she needs quite

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,580
some rehab during the year everything

00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:33,159
went fine but I just didn't have time

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,500
and I didn't want to spend I couldn't

00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,559
spend time on it so take a year off and

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,559
then you will value it even more the

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:45,760
next year but take a look at you take an

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:48,370
eye on yourself and see that you don't

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:53,519
burn out but I think there's a general

00:23:48,370 --> 00:24:01,110
rule in development as well not just in

00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:06,190
organizing sprints this was last year

00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:08,710
similar group kaanchi is still there

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,559
with the little one as well there you

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:15,899
see a nice picture of the KD in life

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:18,789
people who got contact with I think that

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:21,880
guy from the visual design group where

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:24,610
they're do some review of the user

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,740
interface on the other side you see some

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:30,279
visitors who are playing with SH

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,549
accompli trying out new stuff and are

00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,860
probably at least these these kids came

00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:39,429
back almost every year some new KD

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:42,070
software users who come there there you

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:45,519
see another m distraction we offer

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:48,750
during the week and I did I got a new

00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,980
idea for another more sportive

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:55,480
destruction during the year this

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:57,970
direction that's a puzzle we always have

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,909
their on a table it's mostly a puzzle of

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:03,010
between between 1000 and 1500 pieces

00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:07,690
it's the group picture from the year

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:11,080
before so we always try people can do it

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:14,230
between compiling or this kind of stuff

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,240
to do this puzzle and finish it and

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,360
there were years we could finish it and

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,149
there were years where it didn't work I

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,000
didn't do study about if it correlates

00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:28,600
with the success of the meeting but

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,730
people seem to like it and this that's a

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,169
nice picture about different groups that

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,299
are there who talk with each other

00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:36,360
Miriam

00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:40,259
Jill and Olivier from different groups

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:49,590
that talk about common problems or come

00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:55,950
things so I think in general it's its

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:57,960
work you do to facilitate work other

00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,879
people can do and motivate them so if

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,529
you offer them a great environment

00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:06,149
doesn't need to be the middle of nowhere

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:08,850
people will come if you're welcoming and

00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:12,779
Katie in general is in my opinion very

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:16,999
welcoming and people can be very very

00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:22,609
productive there and it's still a

00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:27,749
pleasure to offer the week two different

00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:31,830
free software hackers and takers so

00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:33,570
that's last year as I told you we have

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,639
different with quite a lot of rooms

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:39,600
there so last year people decided to use

00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:42,509
another big room and marble marble guys

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,999
are meanwhile I think that's it's mostly

00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:46,799
occasion where marble mentors and mobile

00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:50,070
google Summer of Code students meet each

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,739
other the first time but more but but

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,840
and marble is meanwhile something like

00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:57,059
infrastructure of kdf to run da meetings

00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,629
as well they are there almost every year

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:03,210
and torsten mostly sometimes we it

00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:04,980
matches by coincidence that the moon

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,700
phase is the right one and he brings his

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:12,809
telescope so you can go outside and

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:14,940
enjoyed the clear sky which you have in

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,559
the mountains and see some stars there

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:21,239
as well and there you see the people

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,759
standing politely in a row to get their

00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:26,639
food which of course people need to get

00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,730
more energy to work again what we don't

00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:32,639
see here is I mean Switzerland is quite

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,470
famous for chocolate and we tried my

00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:38,730
personal goal is that people leave with

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:40,320
at least two kilos more each and for

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,759
people who were there they know why and

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,930
we like several chocolate rounds during

00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,820
a day

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:53,330
and people should have we need severe

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:57,540
enough energy to code like crazy so

00:27:53,330 --> 00:28:00,420
thanks for listening are there any

00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:04,940
questions for the case not i'm still

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:16,980
here till tomorrow something after noon

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:27,180
yeah that's it from myself yes you have

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:29,700
ve VN yeah the question is I think the

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,960
meetings how do I get to the themes or

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:37,710
topics of the meeting at first it was

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,710
mostly that I that I picked groups that

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:44,280
wrote my software I mean plasma I used

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,380
it then other groups learned about

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,940
Rhonda meetings and wanted to join as

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,280
well I mean we have this infrastructure

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,260
ready it doesn't matter if 10 more

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,220
people are there or not and in the

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,020
recent years I or we people in KD

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,330
started to talk with each other what

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,790
could be a good topic what what are we

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:05,730
doing right now I mean a year or two ago

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,020
we had bring touch to KDE there was a

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,240
lot of communication between the

00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,130
different groups and we thought let's

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,820
make a common theme that's how we

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,740
selected the things but we are always

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,660
open as I said to two other groups as

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,990
well we have to infrastructure there or

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,990
to other ideas I always never say no

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:39,720
yep yeah we had one year that the books

00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,150
print there were really worked well

00:29:39,720 --> 00:30:08,220
thats coders and steroid documentation

00:29:42,150 --> 00:30:11,730
writers were sitting side by side any

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,680
other questions okay thank you at this

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,810
was the last talked in his room as I was

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,810
