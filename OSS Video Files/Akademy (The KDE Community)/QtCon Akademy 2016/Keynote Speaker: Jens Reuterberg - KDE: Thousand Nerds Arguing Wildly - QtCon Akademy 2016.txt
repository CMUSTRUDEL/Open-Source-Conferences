Title: Keynote Speaker: Jens Reuterberg - KDE: Thousand Nerds Arguing Wildly - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	We often talk about the hope that someone should come “and just make people do the right thing”. Complain that we are too disorganised, that we are too nerdy and technical. I want to argue that we are and that while that may have some bad effects on us, it is also one of the things that makes us great. We should cherish it and use it instead of fighting it. This conversation is about how we do that.
