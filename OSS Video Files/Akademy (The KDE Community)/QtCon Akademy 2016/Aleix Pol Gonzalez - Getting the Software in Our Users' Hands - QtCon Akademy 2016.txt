Title: Aleix Pol Gonzalez - Getting the Software in Our Users' Hands - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	KDE has been distributing software for longtime now, this doesn't mean it every process has been ideal. New technologies and practices appear every day and also new requirements: we want to target different kinds of operating systems like Android and OS X as well as to reach the users in both traditional GNU/Linux distributions and fancier systems like Flatpak.
This presentation will look into how it has been done so far and its reasons, and what should we iterate this process to better serve our users.
