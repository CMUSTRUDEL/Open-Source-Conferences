Title: Arno Schoedl - From Iterators To Ranges - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	Pairs of iterators are ubiquitous throughout the C++ library. It is generally accepted that combining such a pair into a single entity usually termed Range delivers more concise and readable code. Defining the precise semantics of such Range concept proves surprisingly tricky, however. Theoretical considerations conflict with practical ones. Some design goals are mutually incompatible altogether. We will discuss existing proposals regarding ranges and their design choices, and discuss possible alternatives. With this talk, we enable you to be an informed participant in the upcoming standardization discussion on Ranges.
