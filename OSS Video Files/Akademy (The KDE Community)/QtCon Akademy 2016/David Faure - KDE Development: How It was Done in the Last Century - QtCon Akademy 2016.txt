yeah welcome let's welcome our next

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:15,240
speaker David for you will be talking

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,460
about Katie development also the last 20

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,910
years however it was done in the last

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,420
century how it's done today and he has

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,539
been around for basically always in KDE

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,599
and I guess he's the best person to talk

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,599
about this now so please welcome David

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,320
hello everyone and yes i'm here to talk

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,329
to you about a little bit of history of

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,910
KD that sounds boring but actually the

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,829
reason I wanted to do that was I want to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,440
transmit some of the some of the culture

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,989
from the old days to the newer days to

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,280
have some sort of continuity there and I

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,379
think it's also always interesting to

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,530
learn more about where the product comes

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,760
from and have some of the old jokes

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,640
carry around and that kind of stuff so I

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,189
used to look like this yeah used to be

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,010
young and i have here and then the funny

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,970
part of this is what we used to call KD

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,009
1 look like this and one of the things

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,890
it shows in there in the middle is a

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,049
message box that says someone is trying

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,930
to talk to you and that's the very first

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,270
thing i implemented in KD i I needed

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,430
some graphical environment for my talk

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,990
demon thought I need a message box and

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,549
that's how i came to katie just for

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:43,290
message box then well things happened

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:46,470
over many years sorry this way around so

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,810
basically i'm going to tell you a member

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,540
of things just make sure you know did

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,649
you know what the kay inkay d stands for

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,299
in the very early announcement of the

00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:59,820
where where the whole KD project got

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,780
started it used to send for cool with a

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,250
k it was the cool desktop environment

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,439
fortunately that name didn't stick

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,599
around for very long and it became just

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,350
the K desktop environment and that's

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,980
what it says on very old t-shirts it

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,830
say k desktop environment one of the

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,770
very early founders of KD is Kelly data

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,870
hammer who happens to be my boss today

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,730
of course we joked that for him surely

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,020
must have meant the calendar hammer

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,850
environment and since then he didn't

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,460
contribute KD anymore but he created a

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,680
company called KDA be you see any

00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:41,330
pattern there Adam coincidence of course

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:51,610
now who knows what the queue in cute

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:58,250
stands for okay Albert sorry was a

00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:00,500
quasar um I I think that's the other way

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,960
around actually the very young right the

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,420
very first name for trolltech before the

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,620
rostral take was quasi technologies but

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,620
that's because they had to come up with

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,270
a name that started with a Q and why did

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,630
they pick the letter Q because it looked

00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,880
good in the fonts that the founders were

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:21,260
using in Emacs is 0 this letter looks

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,000
good let's use that right so that's how

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,060
they picked Q and then had to find a

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,730
name to go around it and of course the

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,570
lowercase T is because at the time one

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,270
of them very often used to kid was xt

00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,120
the ex took it so they made the Q

00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:42,740
toolkit so it was a little bit named the

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,630
same way did you know that when the

00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,410
founders of KDE chose cute as a

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,760
technology they didn't think of it as a

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,040
binding decision for the next 20 years

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,230
they thought we just need something to

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,060
bring some beauty up but that's you know

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,550
let's just be cute for now we can always

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,230
switch to something else later Yeah

00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:06,260
right at this point we can't really do

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,900
that anymore but it's kind of funny that

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,790
it was a you know decision taken by two

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,860
people win a very long time ago and they

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,960
didn't think of it as a very long-term

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:20,900
decision so how it started is two

00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,060
applications that was a window manager

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,040
and a panel the thing at the bottom

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,110
right

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,900
and thats that's what much assets which

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,090
started in the varial days that's what

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,130
he started with first but then this

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,440
triggered the need for some library

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,080
classes like a class that would stall

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,680
configuration and that's how okay config

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,230
got to be created but of course we have

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,730
the problem of accessing this K config

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,880
object and that's why key application

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,830
was created just as a sort of singleton

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,140
where you could get hold of K config it

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,720
only took us 15 years to finally get rid

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:59,260
of K application but take on finished

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,260
here around yeah I have a complete waste

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,780
problem here okay and then just for fun

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,300
I looked at the very old API

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,890
documentation for ki can loader and you

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,970
can see it was very simple at the time

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,980
it had exactly one to six methods one of

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,960
them returning a pointer to a list of

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,850
strings okay things have changed since

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,370
then we don't do things this way anymore

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:26,140
and already in the old days only half of

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:28,600
the methods were documented so where did

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,630
I find these api documentation actually

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,080
the website that was showing the KD 1

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,930
api docs is still online and it still

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,340
has the KD 1 documentation found that

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:44,230
quite amazing later on that site was

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,190
replaced with developer at KD dot org

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,110
and that site was initially hosted by

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,020
the near the University where Richard

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,470
Moore was working it was one of the very

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,350
early contributors even before me and

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:04,780
just for fun I found his ancient home

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:07,360
page from the time now I want to talk

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,630
about my hero in the KD community and

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,340
that's Tobin vice which three-fourth of

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,490
you don't know about so that's a good

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,310
opportunity Tobin is the guy who started

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:23,860
the file manager which was called kfm at

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:26,250
the time very initially kfm was really

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,990
just a fine manager but it was using

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,330
HTML technology to just show a file

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,990
listing the file listing wasn't a web

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,669
page actually and that meant that kfm

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,200
was also a web browser because it could

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,990
display

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,760
HTML pages basically in KD 1 kfm was

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,490
also taking care of the icons on the

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,860
desktop same design has not reduced in

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,960
these days it was very strange that when

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,940
you kill your file manager the icons on

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,760
the desktop go away as well it all seems

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,730
very strange nowadays but it made sense

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,190
at the time because all of this wasn't

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,780
in the library was the kfm application

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,730
would take would have all the code for

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,730
icons so of course it would do that

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,620
Quinn still has special code for kfm

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:24,060
nice I think you can clean that up

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:30,540
nowadays it is difficult to remove ok

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:33,630
I'll just show that so that worked at he

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,160
did on kfm in KD 1 he then redesigned

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,830
all of it and that's what became

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,450
conqueror and ki o so basically all of

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,550
that code was extracted into a library

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:45,360
that would that's what gave birth to KI

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,160
oh and also at in ke to we created that

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,570
separate application called k desktop

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,510
that would take care of the actual

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,990
desktop so it was separated from kfm but

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:58,980
all of that is based on his work he even

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:02,120
took care of that redesign so he started

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,460
kfm and then at some point around KD 1

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,080
2011 too he said i'm looking for a new

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,760
maintainer of okay FM because i want to

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,550
go up and start my own office suite

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,670
besan ke okay and that's how i came to

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,760
maintain kfm at the time so he went on

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,470
and designed k office so what i really

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,750
like about woman is that he had lots of

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,990
ambitions and a lot of architectural

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,390
knowledge and know-how that led to a lot

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,190
of stuff we still have today because

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,729
obviously to create an office suite one

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,010
of the big design decisions that had to

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,930
be made from the start is we need to be

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,740
able to embed components from the other

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,000
parts of the suite right there's a the

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,220
thing that used to be fun at the time

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,050
was i want a spreadsheet inside of my

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,450
word processor document and that means

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,460
you need component technology so he went

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,200
off to work

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,350
that as well so I thought what I really

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,560
like about him is although the exterior

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,910
work that he did he not only did

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,130
architecture on paper he would actually

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,260
implement all of that really fast so we

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,510
all thought surely he must have clones

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,270
that's the only way that he can get all

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,700
of that done so quickly but the saying

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,470
at the time was Tobin has many clones

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,350
but the problem is he broke the cloning

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,810
machine so we can't use it for ourselves

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,460
so even to this point to this day when

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,410
people say you know you should have

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,120
clones I always answer now I can't top

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,190
and broke the cloning machine one of the

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,320
things you know as I said all that he

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,720
did is still visible in a way but if you

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,550
look at the output of KL client then

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
you'll find in one of the examples it

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,660
says slash home slash vice so that's

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,280
still a reference to top advice that we

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,500
still have in our documentation I have

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,950
to put another screenshot of KD that

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,630
might be Katie to I think quite colorful

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,390
this one this screenshot is actually

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,090
from torsten ran the guy who was doing

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:59,030
all of the icons at the time you can ck

00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,250
world's the you know as part of K office

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,440
so you can see how it look like and yet

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,910
people said we copied from windows I

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,830
don't see where they got that from

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,830
because this looks nothing like Windows

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,320
yes the windows are rectangles that's

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,210
probably the only thing that and and

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,040
also the buttons to close the window are

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,190
on top of the decoration but you know

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:27,040
far from that it's not really windows

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:29,870
right so before get what did we use

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,460
subversion right what did we use before

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:36,080
that CD s what did they use because none

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,540
of us were there at the time what did

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,160
they use before that just an ftp server

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,900
what people would upload their sources

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,300
and then kudo would take care of

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:50,030
integrating all of that that's how it

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:52,370
all started right now a subversion most

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,320
of you might have played with it but CVS

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,080
I have to have a slide by CVS that was

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,420
so great as a as a tool if you just want

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,390
to give your local changes to see what

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,180
you changed you need to be connected

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,830
that's fine we all

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,960
did all the time in these days but not

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,150
at the time at the time to be connected

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,760
that meant you had to dial up with your

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,010
with your 38 k modem and it would cost

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,190
you a fortune just to differ file all

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,440
right you want to rename a file and

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,820
preserve history you can't do that you

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,190
need to ask one of the system

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,290
administrators to do that for you and

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,840
what we would do would be to go to the

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,300
server in the directory copy the file

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,920
which has all of the history and then we

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,660
would tell you ok now you can delete the

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,520
old file and that's how you rename or

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:42,390
move a file very convenient also with

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,650
CBS you could check out every file from

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,050
a different branch because basically

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,270
that all of the branches are information

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,400
that are inside of the file there is no

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,650
global notion of a branch each file

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,180
knows i have this branch it has this

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,100
name and this is the contents i have in

00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:00,420
there so you could do all sorts of wheel

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,560
checkouts from the good reason and

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,720
something else from the old days

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,020
whenever we would create branches for

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,730
redesigning something like ki o the way

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,340
we would call that branch is make it

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,870
cool and that names stuck around for a

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,460
very long time we had make it cool

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,620
branches for many different things I

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,790
wonder if thats related to the cool

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,330
desktop environment that was something

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:24,330
about cool at the time right also funny

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,060
that Stefan cooler who's written kul Oh

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:31,080
W would have as a nickname culo as

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,690
written up there mates yeah it was all

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,730
cool and then the CVS server that we

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,190
were using actually moved to sourceforge

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,350
in two thousand nowadays when you think

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,180
source folder I guess you think mostly

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,340
dead code right but at the time it was

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,440
great they are going to host this for us

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,240
it's excellent opportunity because we

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,700
don't have to ask a university to take

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,230
care of it anymore yeah things have

00:12:50,700 --> 00:13:00,170
changed another question for you which

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:03,170
version of the KDE desktop used coma hmm

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,170
to

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:12,180
kd2 did not use coma we only use coma in

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,890
the betas for KD 2 meaning Africa d1

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,690
with that let's redesign everything we

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,030
need component and bedding and

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,300
everything let's use coma so we had KD

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,310
two alphas and betas using coma one of

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,660
them was code-named crash you can guess

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:30,450
why right it didn't really work well and

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,820
the idea of using coma was we need to

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,740
embed components that's inside of the

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,300
office suite that's also in conqueror

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,710
where we have to we want to have a

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,960
component for web browsing another

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,540
component for PDF viewing and all of

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,000
that right but the initial design was

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,350
let's do that out of process the thing

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm embedding actually comes from

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,490
another process and that meant using

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,190
coma and of course the other use for it

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,280
was interprocess communication as we do

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,500
today as well I have very strange

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,110
memories of that stuff because what we

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,580
ended up doing was basically duplicating

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,410
all of the menu and toolbar API as coba

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,940
API so any time you wanted to do

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,770
something with a toolbar button you

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,840
wouldn't just call a method from cute

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,580
you would go through clover to ask the

00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,120
toolbar button to change so that it

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,620
could be a different hosting application

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,710
that was kind of horrible to maintain

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,420
and make work and lots of other problems

00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,800
of course if you embed something from

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,690
another process what happens if the

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,310
process goes away then you have a blank

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,550
area in the middle of your application

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,650
and all that kind of problems but it's

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,470
interesting that one of the concepts in

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,440
coma is that everything is very generic

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,900
and you can ask for a service by asking

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,340
a trader where you specify your

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,040
constraint and you get a result and

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,930
that's the origin of the trader stuff

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,400
that we still have in KD these days with

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,190
a service type trader and the mime type

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,960
trader it all it's all combat technology

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,960
even though we don't use call by anymore

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,080
so we moved away from coba before even

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,780
KD 2 was out and to do that that's

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,360
because we replaced the inter process

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,480
communication part of the of the usage

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,149
of combat with d cub

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,070
I heard on IRC recently dick up was

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,800
invented at Academy many years ago

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,570
that's not exactly true did you know

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,209
that we didn't have a caddy be in the

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,889
very first yes right what we had before

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:28,250
was developer meetings as we call it

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,870
nowadays you would call that sprint at

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,430
one of these developer meetings I

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,130
wouldn't be able to tell you the year

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,199
but long time ago much estrogen Preston

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,420
Brown got drunk and this they thought

00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,760
okay we can replace coal by in one night

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,410
will write something that can do better

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:46,070
than cover and that's how they were dick

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,230
up and they confirmed to me that d cub

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,320
is actually what gave birth to debase

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,930
later on it's kind of a second second

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,029
iteration of the solutions for that so

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,620
that we would have something that does

00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,810
not depend on the queue data stream

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,800
marshalling but something that would be

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,029
more interoperable so that was one news

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,279
age of combat right interprocess

00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:11,510
communication the other use of it was

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,459
component and bedding and the solution

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,410
for that was you know we don't use

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:18,649
device for that we do it in process with

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,990
simply plug ins we open so that's

00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:24,199
something that Tobin came up with and he

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,690
initially called this canossa so if you

00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,389
don't know your history canossa is the

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,510
name of a castle where the roman emperor

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,519
henry fourth you know he went to ask for

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,279
a pardon is it was basically an act of

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,130
shame and i like the fact that tolman

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,800
said ok I've tried over-engineering this

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,230
it didn't work so now my penance is to

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,870
call this canosa and make something that

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,399
much simpler and that actually works but

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:54,920
we didn't keep the name we call it k

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:57,440
parts shree seal is a ski station in

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,990
norway the reason i mentioning it is

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,720
because we had to KD developer meetings

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,699
there the first one being just after the

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,459
switch to d cup that's where he was

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,350
showing us canosa and one of the things

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,449
about that meeting is that we had a very

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,429
weird schedule where we would stop

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,250
working at noon and then go on working

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:17,929
until 4am and then it's no way in the

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,699
summer that's where you not his descent

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,620
going down for just a quarter of an hour

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,829
that's when you realize oh maybe we

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,289
should go to bed now and then

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:28,740
off again and of course no way means

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:32,370
mosquitoes we had a second developer

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,649
meeting Entwistle in 2006 many things

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,360
happen at that meeting we were just 20

00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,529
people i think one of the things that

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,690
happen is that there was the Euro

00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,309
Football Championship happening at the

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,740
same time and cooler went a bit crazy

00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,360
and painted the German flag on anyone

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,090
who wouldn't who wouldn't run fast

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,990
enough clearly I didn't and then we had

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:54,539
people from the US job status was quite

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,980
funny he would a key bits and then he

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,630
would sleep because of the jet lag and

00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,919
when the competition was finished he

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,799
would wake up again who work a bit more

00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,159
than sleep again whoever's interesting

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:08,880
way of solving the jetlag problem that

00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:11,549
was more sleeping happening Erin in very

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,019
interesting ways yes the photo is not

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,230
upside down that's how he was actually

00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,450
sleeping and then celeste sleeping and

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,779
then others putting a post-it note on

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:26,309
the front saying do not disturb yeah we

00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:28,080
had fun there so that's just a few

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,850
tidbits from the very old days and I

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,340
wanted to share some of that history and

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,260
culture so that now you know what can

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,649
Asahi is you know why Tobin broke the

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:41,490
cloning machine and also I like the fact

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:43,320
that that was you know because there was

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,200
less history in the in the code itself

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,210
in these days it was a lot easier to say

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,500
okay I'm going to redesign this and

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,720
think about the problem completely

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,139
differently and I find that these days

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,539
we tend to take a lot of the common

00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:59,250
infrastructure as granted who lately

00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,679
said I'm going to redesign a framework

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,389
right we tend to just build on top of it

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,429
and build applications and so on it's

00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:07,649
great but I don't really see the same

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,110
enthusiasm and creativity at the lower

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:16,250
levels so I'm hoping to see a bit of

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,250
that again ok any questions

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:30,149
oh yeah well that's easy i wear that

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,919
t-shirt once a yeah for academy and then

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:37,289
at home i have a humidity-controlled

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,639
room though i don't i have an older

00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,950
t-shirt which I'd be wearing tomorrow

00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:43,169
but I wanted this one because it says k

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:48,899
Dexter environment but the older one

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:50,909
says kiddy now so if there's a framework

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,799
you would from the old times which you

00:19:50,909 --> 00:20:00,539
would like to redesign now what would it

00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:02,009
be to bring back the spirit well the

00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,590
thing is the funny thing about this is

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,139
I've never really been creative you're

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,999
right i took over okay FM maintenance so

00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,100
that tobin could go off and start the

00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,919
office with I took over K world when he

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,690
got bought by K office and then you know

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,700
I I'm get the guy who cleans up after

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,840
all the people i do like fixing quite a

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,489
lot I don't think I ever really created

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,320
something from scratch but ok let's do

00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:27,570
it well k parts ok i was involved in the

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,059
cape on three design but and and the xml

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,090
GUI creation stuff but about from that I

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,559
the thing about me is I was in the lucky

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,200
position to be sponsored to work on

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,570
Katie for 13 years so I saw it as my

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,519
duty to do the boring stuff that the

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,759
others then didn't want to do because

00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,809
they were doing that on a free time so

00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:51,480
it's a bit of a different perspective

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:54,119
right but if I had to redesign something

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,619
today I would have to think about this

00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:00,749
actually it's a tricky problem but the

00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,169
thing that the funny thing is what too

00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:07,080
many options are too few options for

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,399
redesigning things it's mostly that when

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,659
you walk in the library and you can ask

00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,519
the cute developers they would tell you

00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:13,950
the same the most difficult thing to

00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,869
know is what do application developers

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,549
need from you because you basically have

00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,299
the view from the bottom and you'll you

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:22,950
like the view from the top and it the

00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,019
reason I like working on libraries is

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,609
that I like providing services to

00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,799
application developers because they give

00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,639
you usually better feedback than users

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,200
would write it

00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:32,999
different different level in the stack

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,529
and you provide services to people you

00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,379
actually know so I enjoyed that quite a

00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:39,239
lot but I think the definition of what

00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,950
comes next should go should come from

00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:42,570
the application unless someone has a

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,669
great ID and it happened in the past

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,190
sometimes but I think it's even better

00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,109
if the libraries are there to serve the

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,519
application developers so it if

00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,570
something has to change I think the

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,059
application developers should be the

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,609
ones saying this should work in

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,079
different ways Yeah right unfortunately

00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:59,879
application developers don't

00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,219
particularly like to design frameworks

00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:04,469
or two and get involved with that low

00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:05,879
level stuff yeah well that's one of my

00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:07,859
things are in red right we have this

00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:09,599
split between application developers and

00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,820
library developers that didn't use to

00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,009
exist it used to be that the libraries

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,239
were a common ground for everyone and if

00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,529
you work on your app and you're missing

00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,299
something you go into the library you

00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:20,399
add it and so on and so on and now

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:22,679
because the community grew so much we

00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:24,359
have these different departments that

00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,419
almost don't talk to each other and

00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,469
that's also something that I find has

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:31,289
killed the little bit of the creativity

00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:33,509
and not just applications and libraries

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:34,829
but also the whole if you work on this

00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:36,749
app you're not talking to the guy who

00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:37,919
works in this app and then you may be

00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:40,919
both invent the same thing at the same

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,089
time and so on but still the application

00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,409
developers can say yeah we need

00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:45,899
something that works better for this

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:48,089
problem and then it can come from don't

00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:50,309
use video from my experience the

00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:52,409
application developers will don't talk

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,839
don't talk to you as a framework garlic

00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:58,349
guy and work around that back they found

00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,609
and then another application developer

00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:01,889
find it will find a different work

00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,779
around and nobody will ever put

00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,789
something in back into the library to

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,200
actually fix the bug yes that's what

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,690
I've been saying for many years and that

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,549
is exactly the reason why we are

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,039
releasing frameworks every month because

00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:15,209
I have seen that change mentality a

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,549
little bit because application

00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:18,959
developers no longer think I have to

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:21,029
work around this bug because otherwise

00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:22,950
the fix will come up in six months and i

00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:25,619
can't wait six months but now that it's

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,179
every month it's a lot what it sort of

00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,279
more worth it to say okay i'm going to

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,659
fix or asks for the back to be fixed in

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,070
the frameworks because the next

00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,959
frameworks videos will actually come out

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,809
before my application is released and

00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:39,739
that helps a little bit with doing the

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,739
fixes at the right level

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:54,740
advert so it's more a comment than a

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,500
question but you know like back in the

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:02,180
days we didn't have a code review right

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,950
I mean those guys that we wrote Cora in

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,750
to dig up in one night probably didn't

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,960
post something for people to read about

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:13,430
it and comment and nitpick for weeks and

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,200
delete got merged so I'm not complaining

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,600
i mean i understand why we need code

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,170
review code view is great and it fixes

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,670
problems you might not see but i wanted

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:28,190
to know like your opinion on being on

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:30,440
the past where we did broke katie lips

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:35,570
and and now where we don't break them

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:37,340
that match if you think we are if we

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,500
could tied in a better balance maybe for

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:43,550
speed sometimes like I have the opinion

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:47,150
that some of the code ruts a bit too

00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:49,100
much hungry beaver sometimes yeah I I

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,440
don't think that could reviews prevent

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,410
creativity or redesigning or all of that

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,180
stuff right both of us work while you

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,000
reviewed my patches for redesigning the

00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,950
way that psycho car works and because it

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,600
was going through code review it and

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,670
because of test-driven development and

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,410
all of that it made me do that work in

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,000
little chunks instead of wiping

00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,340
everything out and then we starting from

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,080
scratch and I think we we all know that

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,120
this is a much better approach because

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,710
we get something that's better tested

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,200
every changes understood and so on and

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,350
so on so I think this is actually an

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,600
improvement over the old Kobo you're

00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,000
hacking where you know stuff changes and

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,130
it breaks for everyone this being said I

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,630
mean if two people really write

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,890
something in the night obviously that

00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,240
work is not going to go through code

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,100
review they do it in their own

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,960
playground and then it's reviewed later

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,200
on so I don't think that could reviews

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,910
prevent redesigning it's just in these

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,430
cases it's kind of a second step where

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,780
you ensure that the thing is actually

00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:48,380
stable and well well done and well

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,350
documented and so on and the act of

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,790
reviewing helps of course a lot but even

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,480
knowing that your code is going to be

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,309
reviewed forces all of us to write

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,370
better code so i think that has a lot of

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:02,419
value even for redesigning and so on so

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,260
in my opinion that is not the reason why

00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:07,140
redesigning doesn't happen that much

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:12,840
more it's it's more the growth and the

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:15,690
well the the fact that it seems to have

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,640
become more morphin to work on apps then

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,760
leaves i don't know but it's it's a

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,179
matter of also the fear of touching very

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,070
old code and the the the problem is

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,960
people seem to prefer starting the wrong

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,520
thing than taking over an existing thing

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,460
and that of course leads to and

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:43,020
maintained library code in particular or

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:45,210
even applications i have a comment

00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,419
concerning code review because i know

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,059
from the history in queen how it partly

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:55,650
was done like I've confined comments

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:59,010
with / / Matthias colon question then

00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:03,210
below another comment / flesh lubos

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:05,610
colon answer so code review was partly

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,460
done by checking into CVS or svn

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,280
whatever was used at the time I never

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,250
found out whether the first name was the

00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,309
one who did ask the question / that was

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:20,520
the one to whom the question was that's

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:23,280
was ambiguous isn't it and I I try to

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,850
blame it but it's impossible to to go

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,770
down because the code moved to off and

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,510
well I still have an svn check out of

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,669
kd3 because sometimes it's easier to

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,010
look at history into an svn check out

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:37,980
then with all the get conversion and

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,020
rewrites and everything but you see the

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,020
reason that what why that worked is that

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,640
we use the thing about all the Comets

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,830
going to mailing list we still have it

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,540
but come on who here is all of KD

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,090
comments right it has become impossible

00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,549
but in the old days it was possible to

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,620
just look at every comment that goes by

00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:58,110
and I was known to actually do that and

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,549
I wasn't the only one and which means if

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,679
someone asked a question you would see

00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,940
in there and reply to that but that's

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,250
also

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,230
kind of a consequence of the growth that

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,170
is just not possible to do that anymore

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:13,980
even with filtering and all that but

00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:18,780
yeah at least these comments were not in

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:21,690
check so that's okay okay thank you a

00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:24,360
lot that makes everyone one last

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:29,640
question over there then weapon x times

00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:31,710
up special question so we started off

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,830
with c++ and we've kind of continued

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,750
with that and throughout with cute how

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,570
do you feel nowadays if you were doing

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,550
it how because C++ has evolved a lot as

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,050
a language if now you are doing KDE

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,000
would you really go down to see this

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:58,110
plus root yeah I don't know anything

00:28:45,000 --> 00:29:01,340
else short question right okay well we

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,340
are thumbs up thank you

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,180
