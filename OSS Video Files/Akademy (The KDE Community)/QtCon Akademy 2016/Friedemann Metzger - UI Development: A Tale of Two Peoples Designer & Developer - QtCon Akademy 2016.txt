Title: Friedemann Metzger - UI Development: A Tale of Two Peoples Designer & Developer - QtCon Akademy 2016

Description: 
	A passion to implement design specifications to each and every pixel is not common amongst developers. Precisely because classic software developers are more eager on developing complex algorithms, optimizing databases and other exiting topics. In contrast, implementing a user interface seems a trivial and boring task â€“ sometimes even demeaning! 
In most cases, the right questions at the right time decide over success or failure of a project. My session will give insights into proved and tested processes for successful UI projects. Additionally, I promote a better understanding of the need for very close collaboration between developers and designers. The goal is to encourage the developers to discuss questions with designers instead of simply implementing the next best solution.
