Title: Ivan Čukić - For a Brighter QFuture - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	The QFuture class has been moved from Qt Concurrent to Qt Core with the release of Qt 5.0 with the aim to make it useful for arbitrary asynchronous operations.

This seems like the last time anyone cared about it - it lives in Qt Core, but nothing in Qt Core uses it. And more importantly, nothing in Qt Core is able to create a new QFuture instance. We can not even model our own asynchronous operations with QFutures, since this requires using private classes in Qt.
