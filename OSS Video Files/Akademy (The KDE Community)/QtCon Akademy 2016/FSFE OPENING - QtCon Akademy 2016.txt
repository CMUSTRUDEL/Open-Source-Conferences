organization with such a track record a

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:53,690
track record where I'm very proud of for

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,620

from websites of the public

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,970
administration we prevented more damage

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,490
we helped people to use more free

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,250
software on their mobile phones and in

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,189
general we helped more individuals and

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,560
organizations to understand how free

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,670
software contributes to freedom

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,869
transparency and self-determination we

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:28,009

anything and I'm I do what I can do so

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,860
um we are here for the summit what is

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,940
the summit the initial idea was to have

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,790
a pan-european or to have a like a

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:50,870
gathering of our pan european community

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:53,930
and what is specific of our community we

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,620
said this summit is going most likely

00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:02,090
going to be on and not the usual tech

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:06,500
conference because of what the eff is a

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,480
V is trying to do is to highlight that

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,440
software is not just about technology

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,180
software is also about social the

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,120
political and economical issues and

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:24,169
these are the three characteristics that

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:28,130
we try to pace the summit on so each day

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:33,280
we made one topic today see economic

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,280
topic today everything is about business

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:43,130
business and free software is whenever i

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,960
am i'm at a booth somewhere or we do

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,220
some public activity or even in my

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,440
private time people ask me so how is it

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,260
possible to do business with free

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,510
software this seems to be a question

00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,100
that is running through many heads and

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,010
that's why for a long time we were

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,350
thinking about educating people or

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,900
bringing together people who do business

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,980
with free software to learn from each

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,370
other

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,090
and interesting when we were starting

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,640
our call for participation the most

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:25,940
submissions were for business in free

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,560
software so there is actually business

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,430
but why do so many people ask about

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,500
business that shows even more that there

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,990
is maybe just some gap that we need to

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,720
fill in in knowledge and in sharing and

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:47,300
teaching each other and I hope that

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,290
today we can help to fill this gap and

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,560
really looking forward to very very

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:59,430
interesting talks about business with

00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:05,970
free software today tomorrow is policy

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:09,300
and community and so we have a lot of

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,180
talks about influencing politics about

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:18,390
lobbying but also about governing

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:20,820
communities about community work and we

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,390
also are starting our community track so

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:29,390
we have a we have some decent community

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:33,000
talks tomorrow most of these talks are

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,740
about engaging inside the FSF II about

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,520
the different scene about different

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:47,370
teams that we have technical translators

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:49,950
and policy teams so whenever you have

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,640
been asking yourself who are these nice

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,780
and smart people behind the f is a fee

00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:00,150
tomorrow's a chance to get to know them

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:04,440

like to go one step ahead for a day we

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,100
like to do not think of code or

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:06,200
programming languages or operating

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:09,410
systems we call this beyond code most of

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,830
the talks on sunday will be about the

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:17,630
beautiful things we can do with software

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:20,990
with free software and to show why are

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,610
we why are we doing all this why what is

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,460
the bigger point in free soccer for

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,180
society we will have interesting talks

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,640
about sir

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:34,580

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,320
sunday they will be there will be some

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,960
trainings there will be about

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,830
campaigning and it will be talks about

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:49,910
open hardware and also really looking

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,709
forward to hear them then we have

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:57,339
another specialty on Sunday we have the

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:59,950
show Europe on Sunday after lunch there

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:03,770
there will be the show Europe which is

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,690
one hour where we invited other national

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:10,339
organizations that care about free

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:14,649
software to present themselves to talk

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,649
about their work about their mission and

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,950
the idea was to hopefully inspire all of

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:24,110
us to see that here in Europe we have

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,270
maybe different cultural backgrounds we

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,330
maybe have different languages but all

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,820
of us we are talking with one message we

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:36,410
are heading towards the same goals and

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:40,850
if we tie together and work together we

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:45,339
can change the to the better for the

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:49,310
whole European Union and system and

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:53,029
finally on Sunday we I'm very happy we

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:56,810
have you Loretta here Loretta will give

00:10:53,029 --> 00:11:00,980
the ending keynote she is member of the

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:04,970
European Parliament for the Pirates she

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,160
mostly focuses on copyright reform on

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,730
Sunday she will talk about the free and

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,570
open source software audit which is

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:17,450
European project to audit free software

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:23,089
code and she will tell us why this is

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:28,370
important and part of the wider public

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:33,760
is in charge of auditing software so

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:38,560
finally some rational organization parts

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,740
there will be lunch every day

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,230
I guess you already have seen this in on

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,600
ground floor in the center on ground

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,310
floor you there will be lunch provided

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:56,760
as well they will be also coffee break

00:11:50,310 --> 00:12:00,279
tonight only there will be a dinner then

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,640
you get refreshments all the day at the

00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:07,930
same place and I like to highlight the

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:13,810
FSF booth which just open as I've seen

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:16,930
it's close to the eating place at the

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:19,300
stairs this is a very unique booth

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,320
because it does not only contain the

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,630
current merchandise material but also

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,610
whatever we found from back in 15 years

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:34,900
so if you have a winter style and

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:38,920
classical things and and sell outs and

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:43,089
leftovers you can get them only this

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:46,089
weekend here at the FSF e booth and now

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:49,750
I wonder I'm going to finish what I

00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:55,930
wonder if Shalini is here or not but

00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:01,030
that doesn't seem like because yeah I

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:04,089
want to thank Shalini and who is current

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:07,360
in turn of the fsp who spend hundreds of

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:16,270
hours of her life time with me to
