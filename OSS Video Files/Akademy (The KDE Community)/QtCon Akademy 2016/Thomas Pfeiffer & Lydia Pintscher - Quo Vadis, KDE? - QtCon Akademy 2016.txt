Title: Thomas Pfeiffer & Lydia Pintscher - Quo Vadis, KDE? - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	This talk offers a behind the scenes view by two members of the team who drove the creation of KDE's Vision and Mission forward, together with the whole community.
Lydia and Thomas will talk about why they think having a vision and mission is important for a Free Software community, and share their experience with overcoming obstacles on the route towards them.
Furthermore, they will give insights into how the vision and mission affects KDE's day-to-day activities and what it means for the future.

one of the presenters is the benevolent

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,460
dictator of KD Lydia and the benevolent

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,940
dictator in training to be Thomas

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:26,580
Pfeiffer so give it in my hand and we

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:29,279
shall start when you're around and sorry

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,989
they were starting a bit late so tars

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:37,290
and i wanted to talk a bit about the

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:41,520
process we've gone through over the past

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,190
year and what's up to come with regard

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:51,809
to quo vadis KDE where are you going

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:53,460
kitty um how did we get here twenty

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,719
years ago my tears at wish send an email

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:02,190
to start a project was named cool

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,540
desktop environment short KDE since then

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,950
a lot of the things he was aiming for a

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,030
desktop and why are men and applications

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,869
for end users with nice graphics and

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,460
everything um has been realized on the

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,630
other hand a lot of the things he wished

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,759
for we hadn't realized not everyone uses

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:31,680
KDE not even close and so on so last

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:36,930
year I started to ask myself okay Katie

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,270
where where are we going how are we

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,530
going to what are we going to do how are

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,920
we going to do it um to give Katie a bit

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:53,040
more of a sense of direction again after

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,710
this has served as well for 20 years so

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,600
I started um an initiative called

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,579
evolved and KDE what was the question of

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,939
where are we where do we want to go and

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,939
how do we get there and we

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,010
one as a start of that we have done a

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,880
survey which I presented last year at

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:21,650
Academy and we have asked a lot of

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,750
questions to figure out where answers to

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,040
the questions I just mentioned and the

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:33,080
outcome of that survey where a list of

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,440
actions that we need to tackle those

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,750
were develop a vision strategy and focus

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,790
for Kitty review all our initiatives and

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,040
products and even evaluate which of

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,000
those we should actually really focus on

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,300
and make them truly shine improve our

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,010
recruiting and onboarding processes and

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,720
documentation to make it easier for

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:02,600
people to get into Katie simplify and

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:07,130
clarify our main web presence because if

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:11,090
you go to KD org not exactly a pretty

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:14,030
sight and the last one was develop ideas

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,690
and processes for how to make better use

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:21,560
of our social media presence dot outlet

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,120
and other outreach venues of all of

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,239
these the most important one is the

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:33,440
first one develop our vision strategy

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:35,890
and focus during Academy last year we

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:42,080
then started the vision creation process

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:45,980
with a keynote by me and then buffs many

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:50,150
hallway discussions and mailing lists

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,640
discussions and here you can see one of

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,780
those very pretty whiteboard blackboard

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,570
pictures that we created during this

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:10,330
buff and with that i'm handing over to

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:13,250
thomas thank you so the the next step we

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,950
took it to the community because of

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,500
course a vision which is not supported

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,400
by at least the majority of a community

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,400
won't get us anywhere

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,570
so we presented a draft of the community

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,090
and then within the community another

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,680
group formed which also created their

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:39,190
own um vision draft but was kind of two

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,840
competing drafts at some point I've only

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,900
linked to them there because they're

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:50,740
rather long and I don't want you to just

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:53,860
spend a few minutes reading text and the

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,630
the original group then created a more

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,720
concise vision draft which read KDE

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,850
through the creation of free software

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,580
enables users to control the digital

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,860
life KDE software enables privacy make

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,380
simple things easy and complex scenarios

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,920
possible by crossing device boundaries

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,190
so at this point we wanted to be short

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,830
but still kind of comprehensive but in

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,320
the discussion then found out that this

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,640
was already too much because it already

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,920
went too much into detail and there was

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,290
still there was a period with rather

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,390
intense discussions between the two

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,340
groups and there was a point where we

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:41,620
thought we might never reach the

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:44,160
consensus because one group wanted to

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,430
have a rather inclusive vision which

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,550
wanted to demonstrate why where we want

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,010
to go but not how we want to go there

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,270
whereas the other group had a vision

00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:00,460
which was more focused on things like do

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,620
we only want to do desktop software or

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,410
mobile as well do you want do we want to

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,140
do web services or not and all of these

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,040
things and at some point we realized

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:15,570
okay this is all valuable information

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:19,540
but there are actually two levels as

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:24,490
that you are already hinted at there's a

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:28,090
vision which explains where we want KDE

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,490
and also the world to go and there's a

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,220
mission which details more how we want

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:37,100
to get there and since we're

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,740
is that the one of the drafts was

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,530
already quite deep into the mission

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,070
level we found out that we could

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:48,260
actually create a vision which everyone

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,120
might agree with so there was a second

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,690
draft which is already considerably

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,610
shorter and only reads KDE creates

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,100
technology for world in which everyone

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:03,200
has freedom privacy and control over the

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:06,650
digital life and this was then further

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,900
refined into a world in which everyone

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,060
enjoys freedom and privacy and has

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,610
control over the digital life because we

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,870
thought that we didn't have to repeat

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,340
our name in the vision and then when

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,790
discussing this we realized that

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,700
actually the control aspect was most

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:29,419
important for everyone I found out that

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:34,040
even the formerly competing groups could

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:37,250
actually agree on one vision which is a

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,430
world in which everyone has control over

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,640
the digital life and enjoys freedom and

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:49,000
privacy and from that point on this

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:52,490
became the official vision of KDE and

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,300
this that pretty well reflects what

00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:02,630
katie is all about and and this is what

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,760
we learn from the whole process first

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,270
yeah we had to learn the hard way that

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,180
soul-searching is hard and takes time we

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:15,350
started the whole effort at last Academy

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:19,640
but the final vision was only ready in

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:21,860
May and but it is time that you need

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,080
because we are a big and diverse

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,600
community and you can't just say well

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,419
this will be our vision just check off

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,599
on it and that should be okay you really

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:34,380
have to have that discussion to reach a

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,360
good vision

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,090
and we also learned that you have to be

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,130
very precise in defining and explaining

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,140
what you are trying to create because

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,510
originally we just talked about a vision

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,820
and then when there were these two

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,120
different drafts we realized that people

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,430
understood quite different things when

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,070
talking about visions it isn't a really

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,320
precisely different defined time so

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,740
terms are pretty much yeah everybody

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,590
understands something a little different

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,220
by talking about visions but then at

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,200
some point I took the time to really

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,850
detail again okay what do we think a

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,820
vision should entail what do we think a

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,990
mission should entail and this was the

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,150
point where yeah we realized okay we can

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,890
integrate all these things we we want

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,830
and we think are important but we have

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,420
to do it on different levels and only

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,630
then we could actually agree on

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,790
something and yeah that was also when we

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,160
realized that sometimes positions are

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:39,840
less far away from each other than you

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,950
think because yeah we all want users to

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:48,650
be in control we all want users to have

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:51,300
privacy and freedom which is we might

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,860
have different priorities on how to get

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
there but that is not really the

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,580
important part the most important part

00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:02,370
is that we all want to go to the same

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:04,590
place and yeah then of course a Widgeon

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,450
would not work if people don't buy into

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,480
it that's not something that can be

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,710
dictated from the top down it has to be

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,520
it has to come from the community and

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:19,620
yeah then it was really was a positive

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,060
surprise when we had came to a point

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,680
where everybody said yeah this is

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,070
something that I really can identify

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,870
with and only then we were at the point

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,790
where the vision actually becomes useful

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,680
and yeah creating a vision having a

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,310
vision but also the process around it

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,590
has been incredibly valuable because

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,110
whereas the the discussions sometimes

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:46,500
we're rather strenuous and there was

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,550
very heated debate it was important

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,649
because we had

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,260
do this soul-searching we had to find

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:56,339
out where do we agree where do we

00:10:52,260 --> 00:11:02,190
disagree otherwise we cannot go into the

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:04,860
same direction so what's next as I

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:09,180
already said now that we have the vision

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:16,350
we need to go to the next level which is

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:18,870
a mission so vision is the where we want

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,610
to go a mission is how we want to get

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:26,160
there and so pretty much immediately

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,860
after the vision was published we

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,070
started brainstorming on the KD

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,589
community mailing list which is a list

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:39,180
that theoretically every contributed to

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:42,180
KDE should be subscribed to and it is

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,820
for discussing any non technical topics

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:49,110
which half importance for the whole

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:52,410
community but it turned out that not

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:57,630
that many actually contributed to the

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:59,910
discussion and so at some point there

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,870
were a few people discussing they had

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:06,750
very different positions not on the on

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,750
the overall theme but on some important

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,089
details and and we thought okay we can

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:16,040
now discuss this to death and maybe

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,930
someone wins their discussion but then

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,640
we still don't know the the position of

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,680
the one who has won the discussion is

00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,190
the position of the majority of KDE and

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,589
if we created a mission which was only

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,170
supported by a minority then we could as

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:36,079
well just leave it and not have any

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:39,120
mission at all so what I did since I'm a

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:46,190
psychologist and use a researcher I Rena

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:49,589
serving so the sample of the survey was

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:54,269
201 self-identified currently or

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:59,510
formerly active KDE contributors and we

00:12:54,269 --> 00:13:02,030
also recruited users because a

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,580
was the contributors are the most

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,760
important people because they have to

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,830
carry the the mission forward but we

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,290
also wanted to find out what our users

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,510
think because when having doing

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,940
something that has nothing to do with

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,280
what i use this one is not really a good

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,190
thing anyway so it was at least

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,590
interesting to find out how close are

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,170
all goals with our goals and priorities

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,380
with those of our users we also had

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:34,640
eleven hundred and eighty-four KD users

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,490
and they were recruited by a KD mailing

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,500
lists I try to send it to as many

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,750
mailing list as possible to reach as

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,730
many people as possible also those who

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,760
were not subscribed to the KD community

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,940
list we published an article on Kelly

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:56,020
dork and in various groups on Google+

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:58,880
where katie uses in KDE enthusiasts meet

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,980
so what were some of the key findings

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,570
the very surprising finding was that

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,020
contributors and users are quite similar

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,960
in their priorities so this is really a

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:17,150
good thing so it seems like we're not

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:19,520
out of touch with our users and that

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,700
means that if we derive a mission from

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:29,270
these results it should resonate with

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:33,230
our users so 11 part where there was a

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:35,390
bit of divergence was that whereas the

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,650
contributors also wanted to focus on

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:41,920
free software platforms for a software

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:46,520
the contributors also think that

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,830
platforms like Windows OS 10 or iOS are

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,710
also important not as important as the

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,620
free ones but that we also should reach

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,480
people there so we can still convince

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,810
them to use free software even if they

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,450
use proprietary operating systems that

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,460
that is a point where the users that

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,790
participated in the survey slightly

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,880
disagree they apparently they're all

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,570
Linux users and they just want us to

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,020
focus mostly on Linux

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,680
and that also was reflected in a

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,500
different priority in maximizing our

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,800
reach so que de contributors do want to

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,890
reach as many users as possible whereas

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,200
yeah well the users we interviewed

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:34,590
probably mostly care about us reaching

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,470
them and not reaching out which makes

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,780
sense for them that shows that yeah this

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:44,790
is something where some difference is

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:47,100
okay then yeah of course the the most

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,950
important part is creating products that

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,860
actively provide controlled freedom and

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:56,460
privacy but also an excellent user

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,920
experience so that having having great

00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,950
free products which nobody likes to use

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,930
won't get us anywhere and actually the

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,870
most important thing for both

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,900
contributors and users was stability and

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:12,720
reliability this is really something

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,910
where yeah we can still step up our

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,460
efforts and really get to a point where

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:21,090
KDE is known for stable and reliable

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,250
software and these are followed in

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,250
importance by usability and then of

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,780
course features not just as many

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:34,350
features as possible but the features

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:37,680
that users need then one thing KDE

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,410
doesn't do only development we also do

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,070
things like mentoring programs we are

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,320
active in there are several

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,330
organizations in the the wider free

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,450
software community and this is something

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,550
that again both contributors end users

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,740
found very very important so we had a

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:59,370
scale from one to seven and they ranged

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:03,300
all above six so it is not something

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,800
that yeah we just do because we've

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,570
always been doing it it is something

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,579
that is really important and we should

00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:14,750
keep doing it and it was also a question

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:18,839
about which platforms to support they're

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,630
both contributors and users wanted us to

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,990
focus most on open-source platforms

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,779
including Android and then yeah to a

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,299
lesser degree

00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,399
proprietary platforms and as I said this

00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,979
is something that contributors find more

00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:35,859
important than the users which

00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:40,029
participated and it was also questioned

00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:43,359
about target audiences well it turns out

00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:47,129
that students and developers should be

00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:52,539
the most important target audiences this

00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:54,729
it might have been protest that way with

00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,219
keeping in mind that these are most

00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:59,739
likely to contribute back to the

00:17:57,219 --> 00:18:01,749
software so if we focus on those for

00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:07,379
first then this might give us the best

00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:10,269
avenue to actually grow but also other

00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:12,339
regular users free software enthusiasts

00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:15,609
also office users were also considered

00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:21,399
important and professionals as well

00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:22,929
children to a lesser degree then there

00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,739
was a question on whether we should

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:29,820
focus on desktop applications or also on

00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:32,769
web services and whether it should be

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,559
clear focus and cute or basically any

00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:42,509
toolkit that does the job and the the

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:45,070
answers were very pragmatical medic so

00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:49,839
we should still focus on desktop

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:54,279
applications um also more why but to a

00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:57,070
lesser extent than desktop and web

00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,690
services we're a very heated debate

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,869
because there were some people which

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,639
said that if we do web services now as

00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:06,570
well then this will just dilute our

00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:09,879
focus but the the survey turned out that

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,259
web services are also important but not

00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:13,629
as important as got the desktop

00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:16,599
application so it's good if we integrate

00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:20,369
new projects doing web services that is

00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:23,019
absolutely fine for KDE but should not

00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:25,330
divert resources away from the desktop

00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:29,190
applications so this is something that

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:32,320
could be drawn from these results and

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,839
yeah cute is still all most important

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,849
tool kit and KDE should still be the

00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,060
go-to community when it comes to

00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:39,680
everything cute

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,350
but that doesn't mean that we should

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,540
shun any other tool kit so if something

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:48,820
else does a specific job better than

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:55,490
cute then it is fine for KDE to use that

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:58,010
and now that we want to take that

00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,730
further we have for those who are still

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,820
here next week we have set up a buff on

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:08,110
Tuesday at four where we will discuss

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,210
further about the results and how to

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:15,410
continue from there and create a mission

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:28,460
statement from these so that's all from

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:37,340
us thank you any questions we have five

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:39,090
minutes Martha can prepare during the

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:46,640
question type

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:46,640
anybody wasn't it costing or anybody oh

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,170
no that there was a time where it was

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,820
more exhausting than invigorating and

00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:00,480
where we were close to the point of just

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,690
giving up but we are all very glad that

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,240
we pulled through because then at the

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:26,540
when we were over that point it was

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:29,790
really invigorating yeah so the question

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,920
what's the relation between your

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,720
conclusion that the main target audience

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,440
are the students and developers as

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,680
opposed to the conclusion by plasma team

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:46,530
in CERN that we should make stuff for

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:48,920
professional users and similar ah so the

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:53,190
each project of course has their own

00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:58,110
target group so that some like KD edu

00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:01,800
will be more for students and teachers

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:06,830
and I think it is fine for plasma to

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,730
focus on professional users as long as

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,670
developers and students are not

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:16,050
forgotten or left behind so it's not

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:18,510
where we still mostly a community of

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:21,750
volunteers so we cannot have a binding

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,900
mission which dictates that now everyone

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,240
has to focus exclusively on developers

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,310
and students but of course it would be

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,500
bad if those target groups were

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,940
completely left behind by the majority

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,940
of applications

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
Oh

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:56,820
you had some problems reaching all the

00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:59,700
KT contributors from what I've seen do

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,650
you think in the future you will do

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:14,610
something differently to better be able

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:17,640
to reach everyone inside Katie well

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:21,060
there is at least we have to I think we

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,120
have to find a way to get everybody on

00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,060
at least one common mailing list so we

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,740
that we have originally we had the kdv

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,420
membership mailing list which of course

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,490
is only four members of the GDB and

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,470
community the community mailing list

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,940
actually was derived from that one

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,590
because at some point we realized that

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,930
we are discussing things here which are

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,180
not only relevant to the e.b members but

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:49,550
to everyone in haiti so that's why

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:52,350
community was created but unfortunately

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:55,050
we seem to have missed the opportunity

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,140
to get everyone onto that list we can't

00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:01,470
really automatically subscribe people

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,200
but yeah we will have to find a way to

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,630
reach everyone at least at one points of

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,550
the old subscribe to Katie community so

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,770
that at least we can reach everyone

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,800
through them and yeah that is really

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,850
really an important thing and I

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,440
sometimes when I talk to people and say

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,180
yeah we have discussed that i'm candi

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,730
community and then they say what is that

00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,840
I don't even know it existed and that is

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,610
really a problem because we're

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,290
discussing very important topics theatre

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,440
well yeah this is something we have to

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,440
fix

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:45,660
well you mentioned that between

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,270
contributors they feel that it was

00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,610
important to to target proprietary

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,430
operative systems like Windows and Mac

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:57,390
but the users did not think that that

00:24:53,430 --> 00:25:00,540
was a priority may that we because

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,030
probably we are not not reaching the

00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:19,380
users of that operative systems now so

00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:22,830
they cannot answer the survey yes that

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,210
that is most likely the cause and we we

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,700
had thought that maybe there were some

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,920
people who for example use linux at home

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,200
but windows at work and who would also

00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:35,100
want a software to be available on

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,560
Windows but it it seems that yeah most

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,740
of the of the people who reply to that

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,780
survey we're just linux users so this is

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,940
also why we should not derive from that

00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:49,290
that we should not target windows or

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,390
always 10 or whatever and yeah so that

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:58,650
was just a natural part of the selection

00:25:51,390 --> 00:26:02,420
of the sample probably so that was it

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,420
