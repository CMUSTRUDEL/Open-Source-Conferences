In this presentation we will talk about the new C++ concurrency features that have been included in the Concurrency Technical Specification. 

The TS should be of interest to anyone writing concurrent code in C++. The proposal includes improved futures for wait-free composition of asynchronous operations (including their relationship with C++ 'await'), new synchronization constructs as well as atomic smart pointers.
