I'm excited about constexpr. It's probably my favorite C++11 feature and it's gotten even better with C++14. But when I talk to other developers about constexpr they seem puzzled. What sorts of useful computations can the compiler possibly do before runtime?

I'd like to take this session to explore some of the capabilities that constexpr brings to the table. We'll look at compile-time parsing, floating-point computations, and containers. We'll also talk about motivations for computing these at compile time.

This session builds on the "constexpr: Introduction" talk.

If you ask his children, they will tell you that Scott has been writing software since dinosaurs roamed the earth. In 1996 Scott learned C++ by working through the exercises in Stroustrup's TC++PL 2nd edition and he has never looked back. Scott is currently working at Ripple Labs developing open source crypto-financial software. When he's not writing code Scott plays the Chapman Stick, sings rock and roll, and spends time with his lovely wife.
