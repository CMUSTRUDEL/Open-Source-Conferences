Visual C++ 2015 supports the development of apps for the Windows platform as well as for Android and iOS. A single code base, possibly with a thin platform-specific UI layer, can be compiled to run on Windows, Android, and iOS. The resulting binary can be published to a device and debugged, all from within Visual C++ 2015. This presentation introduces you to such cross-platform mobile app development, including debugging and emulation, and includes a number of demos.

Marc Gregoire has worked as a software engineer consultant for 6 years for Siemens and Nokia Siemens Networks on critical 2G and 3G software running on Solaris for telecom operators. This required working in international teams stretching from South America and USA to EMEA and Asia. Now, Marc is working for Nikon Metrology on 3D scanning software. His main expertise is C/C++, and specifically Microsoft VC++ and the MFC framework. Next to C/C++, Marc also likes C# and uses PHP for creating web pages. In addition to his main interest for Windows development, he also has experience in developing C++ programs running 24x7 on Linux platforms; for example, EIB/KNX home automation controlling and monitoring software. Since April 2007, he received the yearly Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award for his Visual C++ expertise. Marc is the author of "Professional C++, Second and Third Edition", published by Wiley/Wrox, is the founder of the Belgian C++ Users Group (www.becpp.org), and has written a number of articles which have been published on CodeGuru and/or his personal blog. He also creates freeware and shareware programs that are distributed through his website at www.nuonsoft.com, and maintains a blog on www.nuonsoft.com/blog/.
