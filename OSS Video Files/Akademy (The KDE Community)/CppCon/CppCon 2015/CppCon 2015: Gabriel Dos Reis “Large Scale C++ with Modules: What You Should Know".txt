“Modules” are a frequently requested and long-awaited feature by C++ programmers.  In a nutshell, the idea is to have a direct language support for (a) expressing the boundaries and dependencies of a program component; (b) isolating source codes from macro vagaries; (c) scaling compile time, especially for large projects, given the ubiquity of “headers-only” template libraries; (d) spur innovation and deployment of semantics-aware developer tools.

This presentation will focus on three major points: (1) the design of the module proposal currently being considered by the C++ standards committee (design goals, properties, constraints); (2) implementations currently under way; and (3) early user experience and migration.

Modules directly address a problem (scalability) listed as one of the three major areas where C++17 is expected to significantly improve daily experience of the working C++ programmer.  Naturally, this feature is  also on the top ten list of C++17 functionalities Bjarne Stroustrup put forward in his “Thought on C++17.”
