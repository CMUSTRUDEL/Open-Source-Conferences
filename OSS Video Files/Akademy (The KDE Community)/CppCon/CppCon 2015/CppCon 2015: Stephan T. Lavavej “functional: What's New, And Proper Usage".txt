functional gained lots of machinery in C++11, with further changes in C++14 and C++17. This talk will cover what's new in 11/14/17, focusing on how to use it properly. For example, you've probably used std::function, but do you know the criteria for activating the Small Functor Optimization? (It's not just being small!) We'll also look at bind(), mem_fn(), C++17's invoke(), and more.
