Are you a C++ community leader? Would you like to be?

If you are or would like to be working to build a C++ community, either on-line or in meat space, we'd like to hear from you about your challenges and your successes.

We'll hear from successful community leaders, answer questions, and share resources and ideas. We'll discuss user groups, conferences, podcast, and online communities and forums.
