Move semantics, introduced with C++11, has become a hallmark of modern C++ programming. However, it also complicates the language in many ways. Even after several years of support, experienced programmers struggle with all the details of move semantics. And style guides still recommend different consequences for programming even of trivial classes. And in the C++ community we still discuss semantic details.

While I took the time to write up all the facts and details in my new book "C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide (cppmove.com), I learned a lot I wasn't aware of. Note that the final book will have 200 pages.

This talk is about the most surpising facts, even experts sometimes don't know.

Some hidden secrets so that you understand C++ a bit better.
