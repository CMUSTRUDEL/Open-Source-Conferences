There are some things that might pass us by without us noticing them as evil or, as they have come to be known, Bad Code Smells.

Many of these little things are acceptable in some cases, and thus pass unnoticed in some code reviews. They are respectful of language rules, and thus pass unnoticed through the compiler's virtual hands. They might even lead to working code... and if it works, it's fine, no?

The idea for this talk came about when discussing with colleagues about such suspicious code and coding patterns, and hearing such questions as "but why is that a problem?". It's about those little evils that creep in code and poison our practice in subtle ways (making memory consumption higher than it should be, making execution slower than it should be, making reuse harder than it should be, etc.).

Patrice Roy has been playing with C++, either professionally, for pleasure or (most of the time) both for over 25 years. After a few years doing R&D and working on military flight simulators, he moved on to academics and has been teaching computer science since 1998. Since 2005, he’s been involved more specifically in helping graduate students and professionals from the fields of real-time systems and game programming develop the skills they need to face today’s challenges. The rapid evolution of C++ in recent years has made his job even more enjoyable. He’s been a participating member in the ISO C++ Standards Committee since late 2014 and has been involved with the ISO Programming Language Vulnerabilities Committee since late 2015. He has five kids, and his wife ensures their house is home to a continuously changing number of cats, dogs and other animals.
