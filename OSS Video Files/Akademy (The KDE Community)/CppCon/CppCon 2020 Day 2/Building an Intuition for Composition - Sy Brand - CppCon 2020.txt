If you're fed up of reading articles about "monads" and "endofunctors" that don't give you an understanding of how they can actually help your C++ programming, this talk is for you.

Function and data composition are becoming increasingly important in C++ due to features like ranges, continuable futures, and new error handling techniques. Using real-world examples and C++ programming idioms, I'll help you build an intuition for the mathematical concepts which underpin these so that you can make the most of them in your code and build your own abstractions built on the same foundations.
