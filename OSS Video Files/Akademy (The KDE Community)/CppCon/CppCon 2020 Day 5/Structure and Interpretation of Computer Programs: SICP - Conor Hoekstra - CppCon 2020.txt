This talk will summarise what can be learned from the infamous MIT textbook the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the book that some engineers have referred to as their "bible." Concepts that are taught in the book will be shown in modern C++ (as opposed to Scheme or a LISP dialect that is used in the textbook). Some of the concepts include: functions, higher order functions, abstract data representations, concurrency & streams and metalinguistic abstraction.

This is the first book that the The Programming Languages Virtual Meetup (PLVM) worked their way through. The PLVM had their first meeting in May 2020 and have been working their way through the book since then.
