Writing reliable and maintainable C++ software is hard. Designing such software at scale adds a new set of challenges. Large-scale systems require more than just a thorough understanding of the logical design concepts addressed in most popular texts. To be successful on an enterprise scale, developers must also address physical design, a dimension of software engineering that may be unfamiliar even to expert developers.

After more than two decades in the making, Large-Scale C++, Volume I: Process and Architecture, is finally here. Drawing on his over 30 years of hands-on experience building massive, mission-critical enterprise systems, John Lakos, using select excerpts from this glisteningly new volume, elucidates the essential value of (and several techniques needed for) creating and growing hierarchical reusable software a.k.a. Software Capital as the foundation for developing C++ software at virtually unbounded scale.
