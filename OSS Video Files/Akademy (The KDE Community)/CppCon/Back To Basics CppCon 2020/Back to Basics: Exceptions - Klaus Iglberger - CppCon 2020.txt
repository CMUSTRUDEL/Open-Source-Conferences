Exceptions are the native error propagation mechanism in C++. If used properly, exceptions enable us to write simpler, more readable and more robust code. However, the path there can be tricky and unfortunately the exception mechanism isn't without flaws. This talk sheds somelight on the current issues with exceptions and why a large part of the C++ community isn't using them. It also gives guidelines and best practices on how to deal with exceptions and how touse them properly. It will go into detail about the exception safety guarantees, explains the tradeoffs between them, and demonstrates by example the individual steps necessary to reach them.
