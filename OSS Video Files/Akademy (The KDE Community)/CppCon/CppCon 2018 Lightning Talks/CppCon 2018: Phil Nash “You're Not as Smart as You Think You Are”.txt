	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
you are not as smart as you think you

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,990
are but don't take it personally

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,599
and what I'm really talking about is we

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,910
as as humans are not as smart as we

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,740
think we are so I'm including myself in

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,990
that even though I'm the one up here

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,510
telling you this so how does that work

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,550
well it's a bit like pod status law

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,430
remember Hofstadter who wrote a girdle

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,070
Escher bark the eternal golden braids so

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,050
he coined ha status law it always takes

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,289
longer than you expect even when you

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,590
take into account pass down as long so

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,809
similarly I coined pills long you're not

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,120
as smart as you think you are even when

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,399
you take into account those long it's

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,050
the same thing so yeah and put myself in

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,370
that well what am I really talking about

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,500
when I say you're not as smart as you

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,379
think you are well if all about

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,210
cognitive limits and to give you an idea

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,890
what I mean I want to burn most of the

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,649
rest of my first three minutes with a

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,600
video and because I'm burning that time

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,149
please probably close attention even if

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,520
you've seen this before count how many

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,670
times the players wearing white pass the

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,670
ball

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:45,009
the correct answer is sixteen passes did

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,930
you spot the gorilla for people who

00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,800
haven't seen or heard about a video like

00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,380
this before

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:55,060
about half miss the gorilla if you knew

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,190
about the gorilla you probably saw it

00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,930
but did you notice the curtain changing

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,149
color or the player on the black team

00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:11,080
leaving the game let's rewind and watch

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:13,570
it again here comes the gorilla and

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:21,550
there goes a player and the curtain is

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:23,380
changing from red to gold when you're

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:32,200
looking for a gorilla you often miss

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:34,239
other learn more about this illusion

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,010
after the original gorilla experiment at

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,530
the invisible gorilla calm so it's hard

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,780
for us to keep track of things but

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,130
really even how bad is it and how does

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,870
it relate to our code because that's

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,209
really what we're here to talk about so

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,820
let's talk about magic numbers

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,459
specifically the magic number seven plus

00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,320
or minus two then you've probably heard

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,720
this before this was made popular by

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,120
George Miller crooked surfer

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,040
psychologist in the sixties he

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,820
discovered there was a limit in our

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,620
working memory of about seven items plus

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,500
or minus two we can hold any heads at

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,739
once and in fact you'd like to revise

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,420
that figure down to about five and the

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,400
important thing is we're all about the

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,190
same we vary only a very small variance

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,130
so none of us are particularly smarter

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,359
than anyone else in this respect and

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,150
what's interesting is this limit comes

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,860
up in lots of different ways for example

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,709
there's a phenomenon known as subitizing

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,340
who hears heard of subitizing

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:42,219
one hand well everyone is I'm sure

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,769
familiar with the concept so you can see

00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:47,140
four items here and you didn't have to

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,629
count them you can just look at this and

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,829
see the fullness and it's not because

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,680
they're arranged in a pattern if I do

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,819
this well it's still easy to see there's

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,730
four items you don't have to count them

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:02,829
even see it straight away what if I do

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,780
this ever so slightly harder now now

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,150
maybe you counted them or maybe you just

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,639
saw two groups of three or three groups

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,450
of two quantities that you can't really

00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:16,660
take in six for most people but if I do

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,419
this now we see six straight away

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,720
because we recognize the pattern and

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:24,759
this is how we deal with complexity by

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,960
by abstracting into patterns it's called

00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,940
chunking psychological term so starting

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:37,289
to get an idea of how this might relate

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:42,460
to our code mention abstraction so I

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:45,039
mentioned earlier ha status law he wrote

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,800
the book and it certain maternal golden

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,460
braids did you know that the Latin word

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,229
for braid is Plex

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,159
which is interesting because as the root

00:04:53,229 --> 00:05:01,150
of the word complex which means many

00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:02,800
folds for many braids and we got our

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,190
model where complex from that and

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,070
similarly a simplex is something with

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,389
just one fold or braid so to see how

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,310
they relate and of course we got out a

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,240
modern word simple from that notice and

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,259
it makes it really clear in the

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,169
illustration that we're not talking

00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,669
about many things a lot the number of

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,979
things that's important because they're

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,289
interactions is how they cross over the

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,300
folds or the braids

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,770
similarly with our code it's not the

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,460
number of things in our code that makes

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,949
it complex

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,199
it's how they interact so whether that's

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,930
through threading whether it's for

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,650
mutability which actually complex time

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,570
and value or global variable with

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,969
Singleton's anything that completes

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,380
different parts of the code so that by

00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:49,360
looking at one piece of code you have to

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,340
think about another piece of code

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,409
to reason about it all these things are

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,300
the things that make it complex in a way

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,090
that it's hard for us to hold in their

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,909
heads at one time so knowing that that

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,919
limit is really small for all of us we

00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:06,069
need to minimize those things minimize

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,650
that sort of complexity so been a few

00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,729
talks on touching on simplicity at this

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,620
conference already so if you didn't

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,319
catch any of these do what should one on

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,210
YouTube I've done a talk on simplicity

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,300
myself before you can find that on my

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:23,139
website and I'm going to be doing a

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,879
class this weekend on TDD but actually

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,120
this material has been taken from that

00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,120
that class because big thing about TDD

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,090
is that it forces our designs to be

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,379
simpler and it's a big part of how TDD

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,939
actually works and how we get value from

00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:43,150
it and simplifying our code so you're

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:46,240
not as smart as you think you are but

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,900
it's ok we can handle it thank you very

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,850
much

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,850
