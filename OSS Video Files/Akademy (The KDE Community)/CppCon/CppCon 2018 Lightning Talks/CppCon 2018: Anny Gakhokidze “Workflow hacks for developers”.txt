hi my name is Annie and this summer I

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,120
entered at Mozilla I was working on

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,700
Firefox Dom engine Firefox is an open

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,299
source web browser and no it's not all

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,660
written in rust most of it is still

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,240
better than C++ so I want to show you

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,160
some facts and tips with you that I

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,750
discovered the summer that helped me be

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,449
more organized and productive so when I

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,489
started my internship and as the time

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,500
progressed I started working on more

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:39,149
bugs simultaneously and it was I found

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,390
it hard to keep track of all the things

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,239
I had to do because some of my patches

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,969
were in cold review some were being

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,100
tested and it was really hard to keep

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,620
track and my team doesn't use JIRA and

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,120
sticky notes are really hard for me as

00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,440
well so enter Trello I'm gonna give you

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,840
three seconds to look at it so the way I

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,540
use Trello is I have a list of lists I

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,689
have a backlog it's all of the tasks I

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,119
have to work on I have a pause list

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,869
where it's the tasks I started working

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,409
on and then paused and testing for bugs

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,049
that that I sent to our remote server

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,330
for testing and testing there it takes

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,590
three to nine hours so in the mean time

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,680
I like to do other things and when my

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,049
code review when my bugs or patches are

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,549
sent for code review I can't really do

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,430
anything but I still need to keep track

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,579
of them so that goes into blocked or

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,220
code review lists so this is great now I

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,530
can keep track of things but there's

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,799
still another problem my local build

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,210
takes anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,149
every time I switch to a new branch

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:59,430
that's 40 minutes one minute if I'm only

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:01,110
modifying one C++ file so and sometimes

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,350
I might be working on a feature that has

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,160
been taking that will take maybe two

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,500
weeks but another higher priority bug

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,840
might come in and I have to work on that

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,360
but I don't want to switch my branches

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,390
like I said it might take 40 minutes so

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:25,840
I discovered this thing and get it's

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:27,660
called get work trees okay so it allows

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,190
you to check to have more than one

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,739
working tree which allows you to have

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,599
more than one branch checked out

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:38,860
simultaneously so let's look at the work

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,860
flow workflow for that okay so let's say

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,330
I'm working on a feature branch

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,989
emergency happens I need to fix a bug

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:50,110
right away and I had a second working

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,450
tree so I do this command and the branch

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,459
is automatically created and it's called

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,250
bug one two three

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,379
I go to my folder so that folder can be

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,470
created anywhere as long as it's not in

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:05,500
your original project folder

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,590
you know I fix the bug I stage commit

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:13,840
and push and if necessary I can remove

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:16,360
the temporary fix folder however I also

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,269
I actually don't do the last step often

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:25,030
because at any given time I like to have

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:27,750
two branches checked out and you know if

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,340
I'm done with my temporary fix I know

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,849
for sure in future I will have another

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,150
more urgent bug come up and so I say

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:39,970
that working the tree for those urgent

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,889
bugs and then I don't have to wait for

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,620
40 minutes bill time actually that is

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:53,929
all I have to say

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,929
