yes I'm a recovering software engineer

00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,580
my job is to make your lives easier can

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,360
I get a show of hands if people use the

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:18,840
Microsoft stack all right you can ignore

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,640
me too you may have noticed if you've

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,510
been using Microsoft tools for a long

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,310
time that MSDN has gone away or it's in

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,260
the process of going away we're moving

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:35,450
to a new platform Doc's that Microsoft

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:38,219
com our content has been switched out to

00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:42,170
basically it's all markdown stuff that's

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,840
hosted on github here's a repo for the

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,450
people S Plus content every single page

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,030
has a couple of Handy buttons at the

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,640
bottom for reporting issues either in

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,410
the product or the content on the page

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:03,449
and there's also an edit button you see

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:07,979
a problem you can fix it as it happens

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:11,070
this is a large old set of content we

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,869
have more than 10,000 articles and there

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,030
are only two of us who are in charge of

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,280
maintaining it plus writing all the new

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,030
stuff for our actively developed

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,240
compiler technology so if you see an

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:31,380
issue you can fix it and we would really

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:33,689
appreciate it I'm going to show you how

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:41,009
to fix a typo

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:43,079
I was seeing an issue today and wait su

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,470
press unmanaged code security

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,250
maybe I should report this there's a

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,860
handy button I could make an issue now

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,399
let's just fix that typo look there's a

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,360
handy pencil icon that means let's edit

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,890
this document

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,189
look it's taking me to github this is

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,979
the actual preview the github renders of

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,879
our markdown content I click that little

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,940
pencil icon

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,330
here's throughout content it's got a bit

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,680
of a llamo header

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,070
I see that as an error wait here's the

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,560
correctly spelled bit I'm gonna just

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:32,620
control see this let's stick it in the

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:38,530
title and in the h1 that's good okay I'm

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:43,540
going to say let's fix a typo propose a

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:46,450
file change so I've made a commit now

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:50,050
let's make full request yeah that all

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,360
looks fine there are some guidelines for

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,290
contributing I'll talk about those in a

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,890
moment we have some automation that says

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,270
oh yeah we've passed it looks okay we

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,800
just need to get somebody to approve it

00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:08,670
so maybe I'll do that tomorrow

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,990
[Music]

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:16,240
all right so since anyone can contribute

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,459
you probably want to know how we

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,510
actually have a contributor guide at

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,580
this particular address to you actually

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,390
I won't if you want to do more work than

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,450
you just see a typo if you just say oh

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,760
you know this this actually is a sample

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,820
as bogus it doesn't work you can raise

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,200
an issue and I recommend it and you can

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,959
propose a fix our style guide has all

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:52,239
the info on how to fork our repo how to

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:54,910
propose a PR how to sound like MSDN here

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,610
I'll show you if I go back to the main

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,769
page on our repo and scroll down we've

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,890
got a bunch of documentation on how to

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,870
contribute it's got pointers to all the

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,890
things you might be interested in order

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,440
to fix that and if you've got more than

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,870
just a typo to add will ask you to

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,120
assign our contributors license which is

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,160
basically a license saying yes we can

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,019
continue to publish this vicked

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,010
and we have an open source code of

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:26,509
conduct which says well it's basically

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,729
what a lawyer would give you

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:36,139
if some lawyer was trying to write

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:40,390
Wheaton's law which is don't be a jerk

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:47,059
and that's it thank you

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:47,059
