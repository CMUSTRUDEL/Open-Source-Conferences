	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,370
so my third year in a row John okay so

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,940
for the stubborn I will begin five more

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,070
reasons not to use : package manager the

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,080
first one it is very complex because we

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:27,090
are used to simple things like easier

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:33,090
than the Papa not to say we are used to

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:36,300
the simplicity of our abilities so if

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,149
this is totally impossible we don't want

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,600
this or horrible syntax this complexity

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,980
into our package manuals the reason one

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,360
of the reasons of this complexity is

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,270
because it is not the clarity the

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,300
clarity is more elegant if we need to

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,050
have some conditioner or some for loop

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,809
that we probably won't need them you

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,899
know we will need them but if we do do

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:04,350
we have elegant solutions or we can

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,450
inject scripts just for conditional on

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,240
the operating system or my favorite one

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,600
to exclude a file for a bill we can

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,110
inject a plug-in in maven just to skip

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,810
this file very simple to do last year I

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,250
was in a dog leash : because we process

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,869
is better I actually meant that using

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,720
batteries should be strictly forbidden

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,880
and as we do in our company if you

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,150
remember our jungle developer in the

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,049
company if you yeah yeah if you wonder

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:41,210
about him he's doing great they take him

00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,210
taking a nap while he waits for the bill

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,600
he will be fine he will be fine and of

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,729
course we consume damage to our fellow

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,250
C++ colleagues and other companies that

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:57,090
they are using : in production saving

00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,060
time and no it's not good for them no no

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,219
definitely they lose they wrote is the

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,200
excuse is to to procrastinate and

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,969
another one is that the current team

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,170
they are not eating their own dog food

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,080
yeah they're helping to create packages

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,940
hundred

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,320
packages with hundreds of binaries that

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,360
the goat $1,000,000 just just in over 1

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,920
million others but yeah the developers

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,600
once a month they need to run up people

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,080
so they are definitely not using their

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,990
tools and my last one it is not a

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,230
standard so I'm going to solve this I

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:39,250
prolly I'm going to propose a paper for

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:42,010
San Diego summarizing my reasons here I

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,080
was writing these and I thought ok this

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,200
is this is too complex probably I'm

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,060
going try to simplify the warden and I

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,490
think this is going to be my final

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,170
proposal I think the committee is going

00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,900
to love it

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,590
well the truth is these reasons they are

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,780
not mine

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,959
I bought them from the ultimate source

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:06,760
of truth knowledge and empathy that is

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:10,870
the Internet Raviv Twitter flag you know

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,910
and but is also the right I got some

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,440
data from the internet like for example

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,209
the gift hub activity double in the last

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,800
four months that means thousands of

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,700
notifications in the inverse of the of

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,220
the current team per month the conan is

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,140
a second most active topic in the slack

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,519
besides the simplest task or language

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,290
tropical curve the behind boost the

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
number of companies last year i was

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,330
saying there were hundreds of companies

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,750
using coronal production that number has

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,580
tripled in this year ok now there are

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,920
many many companies using conan

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,320
production so with all this data I can

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,260
only conclude that there are only two

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,420
kind of c++ package managers the ones

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,230
nobody uses and the one some people

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:05,069
complain about like Oren thank you

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,069
