hi so I was here on Tuesday on Wednesday

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:11,610
we had study group 14 face-to-face I'm

00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,830
just gonna go through all the same

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,839
slides again just in case anybody wants

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,850
to go through them in slow motion this

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,850
is the stuff I talked about on Tuesday

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:30,439
okay so here is the there's a 360 photo

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,969
of the room W room over at the courtyard

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:39,870
can anybody guess how many people are in

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:41,940
the room here it's actually 40 50 51 is

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,090
actually just one the rest of us were

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:51,960
figments of Michael Wong's augmented

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:55,230
reality so this was the agenda we

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,120
basically went deep on a few people's

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,370
I'll go through them briefly

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:06,000
so Arthur's paper on object relocation

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,030
basically if if you're aware of how you

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
have a vector of in for instance you can

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,549
use mem copy to copy that vector very

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,110
efficiently there are a few situations

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:22,560
still where you cannot use mem copy and

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:30,720
you which Arthur aims to eliminate this

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:32,820
trait Isabella presented a smart pointer

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,560
paper for basically this is very useful

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,290
for game developers sage so you have a

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,970
calm object which is reference counted

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,470
but it's not reference counted by a

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,770
control block that's you know other the

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,630
standard library this this type of

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,220
pointer would bring that into the remote

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,450
kind of pointer into the fold so to

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,790
speak the linear algebra paper that a

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,229
guy presented where to start on that

00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,689
[Music]

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,210
yes it's a it's a big topic but there

00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,220
was some really positive suggestions

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,119
about how to move forward with that very

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,910
useful for graphics and simulation but

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,580
also the scientific community will be

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,690
very interested in that too and then Ben

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,770
sax presented Ben freaks paper on

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,000
leaving no room for a lower level

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,910
language now this is basically where um

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,209
it's the function test feature test

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,350
macros could be used to figure out

00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,989
whether a particular implementation

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,000
supports things like exceptions in our

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:41,709
TTI and other things that are not

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,970
available on all platforms and this this

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,870
went down well with the people in the

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,350
room who spend a lot of time on HD one

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,870
which is very promising so is very

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,870
productive day a lot of people came and

00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:00,630
went and and checked out what we do for

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:04,810
the first time and yeah it's great

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:07,930
Wow during the day Michael asked us to

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:13,510
come up with activity that might be

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:16,660
applicable to the particular areas the

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,690
HD 14 is interested in and I just went

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,190
through just looking for things that

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,950
game developers might be interested in

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,840
just basically searching for the HD 14

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,209
tag in the last two years worth of

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,019
papers and there is there's so much

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,750
stuff coming down the pipe which the

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:39,459
game developers would find really

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:42,190
interesting I mean just I'll just call

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,010
out reflection bottom right there that's

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,600
something that's huge in games we often

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,579
want to write an editor or or stream

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,430
levels in and out and we want to

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:57,730
annotate every last class in our game

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,720
very tedious reflection is going to be a

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,500
huge advantage there and that's it

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,450
basically now if you both bonus slides

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,830
because although I mentioned ivory

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:15,190
Thailand recently and working on

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:18,790
autonomous vehicles this is the town I

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,260
now live in it's very very tricky to

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,380
drive through if you're used to the wide

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,670
roads here and anyone said of yonathan

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,380
mullah he mentioned when he was on a

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,140
webcast one time how if you're flying

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,810
over America for the first time it seems

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,030
like it's something out of a Sim City

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,810
everything is completely square and

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,910
gridlock

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,420
nobody really understood what he meant

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,890
so his of his a few examples from both

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,780
sides of the pond to make it a bit

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,960
clearer what he was talking about so

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,970
this is valid just over there just over

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,670
the water there this is the village I

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:59,200
grew up in not square Tempe Arizona

00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:03,210
Square home not square bellevue right

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:08,330
here square Edinburgh not square

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:13,249
Albuquerque Square Bristol not square

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,249
