hi everyone I'd like to introduce one

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,910
the Box online programming language

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,559
testing the environment

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:14,880
my name is takahashi condo I'm from

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,609
Japan Feist mysterious country hiking of

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,420
orgies I contribute some open source

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:26,039
project I'm interested in mqtt and state

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,760
machine my recent contribution was a big

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,090
boost

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,940
Marty indexed hash index support to

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,780
boost prettyprint afford gdb two month

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:41,910
ago it's good news for gdb Yuda I

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:45,210
believe what is one box at first one box

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,329
is developed as online C++ comparing the

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,649
environment now it support many other

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,940
languages for example bash script D Alex

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,789
earth Swift and so on in C++ you can

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,439
choose many versions of DCC and grant

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:07,619
including latest ahead when the Box

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:12,659
provides not only web UI but also REST

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,600
API and editor plugins here is web UI

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,229
you can choose compilers and boost

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,630
library versions this driver is

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:24,390
automatically linked you can use Drupal

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,720
back into the interface in your code

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,759
local host so you can write a network

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,520
testing code such as boost ratio you can

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,950
post issue report and pre request to

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,579
github this is the issue

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,259
I requested adding library Chris

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,259
jiseok's type eurasia

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,600
when the box is developed by these

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,240
people

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,409
the main developer is mere pawn and

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,360
Correa

00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:00,280
this is mere pawns icon

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:04,680
this is his dog pom-pom so cute at the

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,170
same God dogs resembled their owners

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,759
boom

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,250
his portrait so cute

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:19,630
maybe his case is something exceptional

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:21,910
by the way he's my friend I drag to

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,450
demonstrate some useful fact on one box

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:29,200
you can use mud proof files you can add

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:44,260
header files and the data files i will

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:53,050
show you demo this plus icon okay let's

00:02:44,260 --> 00:03:01,450
skip them up important point is you can

00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:05,350
use much profiles okay and okay but only

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,989
you can use much pre header files and

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,390
data file on tsipras press mode if you

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:14,650
really want to do the multiple

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:22,180
translation unit you can do it using the

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:24,900
bash you can choose the same variety of

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,030
compiler as booth library versions and

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,920
the important point is basepaths rush up

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:35,890
to thrash one box it is one box

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:48,420
comparison driver is location okay let

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:55,600
me show you okay maybe it's okay

00:03:48,420 --> 00:04:06,640
important point so if you create your

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:09,240
code then you can okay let's change the

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,490
compiler version to the GCC head

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:24,290
and with ribery to 1.68 like this and

00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:30,710
the quick round I can get maybe updated

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:36,270
okay 68 new version and then click Share

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:39,810
you can get new Pommery it created by

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:44,850
one box yeah and you can also sign in

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:50,070
using github account you can see this

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:54,810
user menu or you are share calls like

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,430
this it's convenient this is a multi

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,220
root

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:02,780
translation unit example this is script

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:09,920
and my dot h PP is simple header file

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,920
