I primarily develop with MFC on applications that perform financial simulations. I have been learning AMP as of late, having started with CUDA about five years ago. I am really excited about what AMP could do since it allows a single interface to various hardware types. In addition I am learning more about writing apps using WPF for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. For hobbies I enjoy working with microcontrollers interfaced to the real world. Both small robotics and automotive applications.
