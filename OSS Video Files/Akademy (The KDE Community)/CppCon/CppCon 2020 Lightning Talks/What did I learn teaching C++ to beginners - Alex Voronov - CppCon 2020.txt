	00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,160
so

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
good morning everyone uh i appreciate

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,280
it's morning uh

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,119
for the most of the attendance and thank

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,640
you for coming this early

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,320
i want to talk a little about a little

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,160
bit about my teaching experience

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
which i had this year like first time

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
after a while uh i went teaching and i

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
decided to share some knowledge with

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
beginners and

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,359
i wanted i want to share what i learned

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,120
about it but in fashion of lightning

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
talks it's going to be more of like what

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,239
did i learn about uh c plus plus and uh

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,920
what i learned from teaching to set the

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,040
stage a little bit uh

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,079
i did this lessons as part of

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,879
c plus london university program and its

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
organization which is providing evening

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,120
classes

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
for free for the beginners who want to

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,760
learn how to program or

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,199
how particularly learn c plus and

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
most of the teaching is done by tristan

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
brindle and olivine and i just joined

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,879
like as a guest teacher to do a module

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,280
on standard library

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,400
and yeah that's how it all started i

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
recommend to check out

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
cpp london uni and especially their

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
youtube channel because

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,760
we also do streaming uh when it's like

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,479
when streaming is not let us down you

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
know it's

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
not always working uh uh and basically

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,320
we're starting

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,320
and we are starting with uh simple

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,240
things and uh you can't get far

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
in standard library without iterators

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,520
therefore i had to

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,439
explain to beginners this probably

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,560
unfamiliar concept i remember for myself

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,240
when i started learning

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,079
it took a while for me to get used to

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
iterators and

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,520
it's not easy to demonstrate before you

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
explain what it is therefore like i

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,799
made this little bit of like textbook

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,399
slide yeah it's like it's actually my

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
slide and it's actually me on the slide

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,560
you can see

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,479
uh and uh when preparing this material i

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
made a mistake not a factual one but

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,960
like in terms of explaining uh some of

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
you may have spotted already something

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,719
unusual

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
and this is this actually before

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
preparing i didn't know that such a

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
feature exists uh and

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
it was new for me and like as a teacher

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,840
who is new to it i

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,599
thought like i need to be thorough i

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
need to follow textbook and i presented

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,760
this

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,280
and like despite i never used it uh

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
and i actually like regretted a lot

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
about it i was quite frustrated about me

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
doing this

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
uh because as i said it's a new concept

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,879
and like we needed to spend a lot of

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
time on it

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,879
uh about iterators and i want to talk

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
about the referencing about incrementing

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,840
and comparing

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
them so like we can do loops and so on

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
and do algorithms further

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,319
and uh actually most of the questions i

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
got about this thing

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,319
and questions were like uh i'm trying to

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,959
figure out what will be the occasions

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
where you

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
need to use it and i'm like i don't know

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
any occasions

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
yeah surely the most useful thing i ever

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,000
thought uh and

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
apart from the lecture went well but i

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
was really unhappy with this uh

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
and the next lesson comes and we are

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
talking about strings and

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
i going through like textbook and doing

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
the preparation about string

00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,519
construction i figured out another weird

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,360
thing

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,560
in brief it's like if you provide if you

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
are slicing a string and provide two

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
arguments

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
uh as numbers uh it's gonna do the slice

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,400
but if you provide one argument for

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
a c plus plus standard string or for uh

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
c string

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
you're gonna get like different results

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
either tail or head and

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,599
like i'm not gonna go into point

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,640
aromatics oh no really how i'm gonna

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,720
explain it to people

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,920
why why this inconsistency and you know

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,560
what i decided i just not gonna do it

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,720
i'm just not gonna do it and that's it

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,680
uh so basically i decided to hide this

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,920
material

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
and it all went well it all went great

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,080
and the main outcome for me

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,799
the main takeaway is that yeah it's just

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
like

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,879
leave the weird edge cases away and just

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,519
spend the effort on important stuff but

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
i have

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
a little bit to add after it not related

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
to the classes i had like a random

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,319
complaint from my colleague

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,959
he may probably recognize himself uh as

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
like reverse index in there it isn't

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
python is beautiful and we don't have it

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
nc plus plus and it's really frustrating

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
and i remember learning about it and

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
having the like sharing the sentiment

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
it's

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,840
really frustrating not having such an

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,560
elegant thing in c plus and after what

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
i've learned

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
and what i regret teaching other people

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,879
telling to other people

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
i actually had an idea that we can get

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
this

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
reverse indexing in c plus we see plus

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,720
plus containers with random

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
access iterators yeah not the most not

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
the code which i would be most proud of

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,000
but still works

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,120
uh and i wanted to share this with you

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
uh but it's just like a little

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,199
digression uh and uh

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,479
back to important stuff important stuff

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,280
focus your cognitive effort on the

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,960
important stuff

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,720
and forgot about sharing like the weird

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,600
edge cases for people who don't need it

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
and that's it what i wanted to share now

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
wrapping

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,080
up a few pointers uh

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,840
first uh as i said check out uh c plus

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,199
london uni

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
uh especially like you if you are

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,320
looking for some beginners content uh

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,440
it's really from the ground up

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,040
uh uh tristan is uh talking about

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
very basics of programming with c plus

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
plus and going further

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,520
to object-oriented stuff also like i

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,440
wanted to share

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,960
that kate gregory's talk provided a lot

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
of inspiration for me when teaching and

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,120
like doing really giving really

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,520
practical stuff without a lot of

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,160
old baggage and also i wanted to point

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,440
about

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,120
my fellow teachers tristan's talk

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,720
today and that's it

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
i say i'm out of time and i'm done with

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
my content

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,199
