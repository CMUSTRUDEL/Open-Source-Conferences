A short overview on some results from the Meeting C++ community survey: https://survey.meetingcpp.com
We'll quickly dive into the surveys of JetBrains and ISOCPP too.

	00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,920
so

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,800
i decided to speak on super fast service

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,480
and frustrated about me um

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,320
so this is two things i want to uh i

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,760
want to just shortly mention

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,000
uh first is the url surveymecp.com

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
uh where you can take the survey and if

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,199
you like online meetups you can find

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,640
what i do with online meetups now

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,239
at onlinemedecpu.com um but let me start

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,600
the starting talk with a simple question

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,280
if did you notice

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
the lack of statistics and facts from

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,160
the real world and talks at

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,640
conferences and i did after a while and

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
the reason for that is that we a don't

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,239
have a lot of data on it and

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
b that often our talks are on center

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,600
features and then it doesn't make

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,480
a lot of sense but let me

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
tell you about the c plus plus service

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,680
uh which have this data

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
uh honorary mentioned for the annual

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,920
service of iso cpp and jetbrains

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,000
uh there you can great graphics find

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,320
great graphics uh about these things

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
i'm going to be going into depths about

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,040
that in my talk at the secret plus

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
uh user osnabruck on tuesday but

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
for now i want to tell you a bit about

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
the tool i wrote the

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,280
serving tool for meeting c plus plus um

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
it's available since this year it's a

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
continuous survey

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
and it has two sides uh two two

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,880
questions uh modes

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,799
singlet and uh much of her choice

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,479
and this is some technical details which

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,439
of course is writing talk don't wanna

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,799
go too deep into it um so let's you know

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,640
ask some questions

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
uh like for example have you been at

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
cppcon

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
and we see that not a lot of people at

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
least who

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
took the service though if you have been

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
at become please take the survey we have

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,720
probably a lot more than uh have been

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,079
but generally for all

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
the questions i have for other

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,119
conferences those questions uh

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,719
we do not see like the majority of the

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
community at the conferences that's also

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,200
kind of logical if you think about the

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
numbers

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,959
um and then of course you can ask for

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
the standards and

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
not very surprising the standards of the

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
last

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,160
decade win here uh with c

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
17 leading that a lot of people have

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
moved to 17

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
and other staff are still on the on the

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
order standards

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,239
and siblings plus 20 gain a bit here

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,040
so but then i figured out i also could

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,599
ask for the standard containers

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
and not very surprising vector wins and

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
then there's some

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,560
other containers which are quite often

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
used but i also figured i could ask for

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
spam

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,080
even if it's not a container we get some

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
numbers on that that's interesting it's

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
not

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,760
um but of course spam is also not even

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
like available for a lot of users so

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
that's going to

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
be increasing i guess in the next years

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,040
uh build systems i asked of course and

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,120
i've

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
asked a lot of other questions and some

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
questions are like whatever choice like

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
this one and i have a similar questions

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
uh in single choice

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,120
and i figured out i also could ask for

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
language and library features

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,840
simple for 17 as an example here uh yeah

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,720
optional is popular

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,480
and and the language features it's

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,599
structured bindings which takes the cake

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
here

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,920
and i asked for super

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,200
11 14 and 17 features so far and

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,280
for 11 i seems to be you know a lot of

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,319
locations and see bus bus which needs

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
some garden

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,519
guarding by a shared pointer or a unique

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,599
pointer

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,159
um and if i look at the time

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,599
i see it's you know if you want to take

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,720
the survey you can do that later after

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
the lightning talks

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,319
and you will find me there but of course

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,959
i brought a bonus level

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,239
uh which we unlocked and this is uh one

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,439
talk about

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,760
two newer features um

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,360
there is a combined questions uh feature

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,879
which is kind of

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
hard to work with because it's more or

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,040
less a

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
matrix of the questions and to find the

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
right combinations and the sea of

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
combinations is not that easy

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,959
i also have a feature which you can use

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
to filter on time i wrote this this week

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,120
and uh for now you can filter on the

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,880
month and by next year and you can

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,720
filter on the years too

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,639
um and yeah so

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
if you're interested in that or on the

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,919
online events which i do you can find me

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
after the lightning talks in the hallway

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
track

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:43,840
second floor table five for six okay

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:43,840
thank you

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,840
