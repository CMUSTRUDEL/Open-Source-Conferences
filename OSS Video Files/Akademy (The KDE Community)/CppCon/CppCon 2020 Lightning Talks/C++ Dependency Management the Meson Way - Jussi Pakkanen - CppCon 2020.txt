One of the most common things heard in this year's CppCon presentations is that C++ needs an easy way to use external libraries. In this talk we'll examine the Meson build system's approach for this problem. Includes a demo of building a multiplatform SDL 2 application with automatic dependency downloading.

Jussi Pakkanen is the creator and project lead of the Meson build system. He is currently working as a consultant. He has experience in many different fields of computing ranging from slot machines to mail sorting, computer security, Linux desktop development and gaming. His free time has been equally colorful, including things such as comics and illustration, directing movies, music and electronics. When not working on projects he might be found watching bad movies, especially sci-fi and the finest of trash from the 80s.
