all right

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,719
hi i'm matthew you may have met me

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,440
before

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,839
um i work at paradox development studio

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
i

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,720
make a bunch of video games um and even

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,480
if i'm just like one guy who's been in

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,480
the industry for not that long

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,359
even if i had a career before in other

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
industry i keep getting questions

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
especially at this conference people

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,599
come to me like but how did you make the

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,600
game

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
or you know how do i get into the

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
industry

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
and i know every time i hear this it

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
sounds like there is this

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
esoteric uh initiation rights that that

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
you have to go through

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
so um i thought about all those

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,360
questions and so there you go how to

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,879
become a game developer

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,879
in five minutes or less let's go

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,480
so how do you write again it's easy you

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,960
need to write a game log so what's a

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,199
game

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,520
it's a very simple thing you have it's

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
basically a while loop that ends only

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
when someone press the quit button

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,960
so what do you do well you process the

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,119
input of the user

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
then you update the world and then you

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,640
render and then you look

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,080
done you made a game all right let's

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,520
talk about a bit more

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,720
processing input is easy it's just

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
keyboard and everything i'm not gonna

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
i'm not about very much

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
update simulation like way what do i

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
mean by that it's basically updates

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,000
simulate the passage of time in your

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
world make the the time flow in your

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
world so for example if you have a very

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
basic physics model

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
the idea is that you take every entity

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,360
in the world that's supposed to be

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
like working with physics you uh updated

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
speed depending on your security

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
acceleration

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
you know you might remember that for

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,399
your like high school teacher

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
and then once you have the new speed you

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,520
just apply the speed

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
take the direction and move everything

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
and then if there's a collision you end

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,399
the lips

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
so you know like people collide missiles

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,260
at the target

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,920
stuff blow up people die we're happy

00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,880
[Music]

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
but it's a game uh and then you render

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
when

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
rendering is easy you figure out what

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
the camera can see like which which

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,640
which beat of your of your world is

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
actually visible from the from the lens

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,920
and then you put on the screen uh

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
everything that should be visible at the

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,959
right angle and distance and then you

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,800
put a ui on top

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
and then you're done another game epic

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,480
where is the cpu time spent it depends

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
um if you're doing like stuff like we do

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,680
on our side

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
a lot of the cycle cpu cycle and all of

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
the work would actually be on the

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,440
simulation side because we simulate

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
complex uh

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
complex world economics a bunch of stuff

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,239
people

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
uh on the other side if you have more

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,239
like a next-gen very fancy super

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,599
free rendering game with like rtx and a

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,800
bunch of other things you're probably

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,040
gonna spend more time on rendering

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,480
but that must be hard like how do you do

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
it what what is this uh

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,480
how how on her did you learn all that

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,120
stuff but

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,640
the thing is it's not that hard and

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
since you may know that i like history

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,959
i'm gonna i'm gonna assure you that it's

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
not that hard

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,720
for example you know space invaders

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,159
right everybody knows space invaders

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
it's like one of the oldest game in the

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
world

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,599
you know that it's a game that invents

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
some difficulty because you know if you

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,200
play the game

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
uh you shoot the space invaders and as

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,159
you go and

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
the space invaders die the game becomes

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,440
faster and faster the space individual

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
moves faster and faster and it gets

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,280
harder

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,720
it's not a feature it's a bug because if

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
you remember what you said about the

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
loops

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
right here you process input you bet the

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
world you render

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
modern games when you process the world

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
you figure out how much time has passed

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
since the last time but back in the 80s

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,319
we didn't

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
think about that the time was one frame

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,480
so as you kill more enemies

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
the update loop is faster so you render

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,680
faster

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
so the enemies move faster but i mean as

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,519
bob ross once said there is no mistakes

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,040
there's just happy accidents

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,799
all right another game that people may

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
have heard about it baldur's gates

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,599
released in 1965 we called correctly

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
one of the first rpgs i ever played in

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,400
windows 95 it was gloves

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
it was epic it shipped in debug because

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
there was a crash at the last minute

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
they couldn't find

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
and the only way to fix it was to have

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,519
uninitialized memory taken care of by

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,040
the debug

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,959
build of fmsvc another game that you

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
may or may not have it's not a big game

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
it's dragon it's a game about a dragon

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
it doesn't have like

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,239
lots of reviews but it's still a game

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,160
that someone shipped and made on steam

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,359
it's an interesting game because it has

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
no rule loops

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,560
and if you think wow is that because

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
it's made by these people of some

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
parents

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
the answer is no it's because the author

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
did not know about loops

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
or data structures the game is made with

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,240
only variables declared at the beginning

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
of main and a bunch of ifs

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
there is no loops there's no data

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,440
structures

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
and i'm not saying that to say that the

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,479
the the developer was bad that's not my

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
point my point is to try to lift the

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,360
mystique that there is around game

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
development

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
because the only skill you need at the

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,800
end of the day is basically programming

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,040
and that's it because code is code

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,880
but what about specificities performance

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,919
real-time constraints memory location

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
graphics

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,120
do you remember my previous lightning

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,800
talk about unicorn

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,800
well that's what i think about it

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
so you don't need prior experience if

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,280
you're interested if you want to get

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,199
into video games

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
you should apply now at the end of the

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,080
day it's still a super space programming

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
job there's no reason why you should be

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,039
gay keep from it you don't

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,080
need to have made a game to start

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,840
becoming game i'm living proof of that

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,080
a world of caution even if i'm

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,600
overextending my time

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,560
there are some video game companies out

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
there that

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,800
may or may not have the best interest of

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
their programmers at mind

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,479
and it's a sad fact but i feel like if i

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
have to talk about getting people in the

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
industry i have to make a world of

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
caution

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
so remember it's a passion but it's

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,320
still a job

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,039
and it requires half skills to find so

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,440
there are some i've heard stories i've

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,600
met people who have heard stories

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
have a chat with your local folks and

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
figure out

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
how is that working because you can end

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
up with a cool company but there is also

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,960
a few other stories and i really don't

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,319
want you guys to end up there because at

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,600
the end of the day we just want to be

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,840
chilling and cool like

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,639
my neighbor's cats i call it chunky

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,479
oh and furthermore i think your bill

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:21,840
should be destroyed

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,840
thank you

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,560
