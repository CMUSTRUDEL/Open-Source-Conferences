Quality C++ documentation is abundant...as long as it is in English. If you're a Spanish speaker and not an English speaker, though, your options are limited. This talk is about my experience in bringing es.cppreference.com, the Spanish site of cppreference.com, up to date to enable Spanish-speaking C++ lovers and enthusiasts a quality experience when learning C++

I’m a linguaphile, sesquipedalian, and software architect. Most of my professional career, from 1996 to 2013, has been in the Public Safety market (9-1-1 Emergency), where I had the opportunity to create software frameworks in C++ for systems that have been deployed (and many still working today) in the largest call centers in the USA, and consequently, in the world.

C++ has been my main programming language, but I’ve delved in C#, Java, and recently Python.

I’m also the self-appointed maintainer of es.cppreference.com (the Spanish companion site to cppreference.com).
