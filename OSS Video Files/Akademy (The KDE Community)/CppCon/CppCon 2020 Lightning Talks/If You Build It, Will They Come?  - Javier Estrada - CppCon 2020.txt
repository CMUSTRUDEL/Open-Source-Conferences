Quality C++ documentation is abundant...as long as it is in English. If you're a Spanish speaker and not an English speaker, though, your options are limited. This talk is about my experience in bringing es.cppreference.com, the Spanish site of cppreference.com, up to date to enable Spanish-speaking C++ lovers and enthusiasts a quality experience when learning C++

I’m a linguaphile, sesquipedalian, and software architect. Most of my professional career, from 1996 to 2013, has been in the Public Safety market (9-1-1 Emergency), where I had the opportunity to create software frameworks in C++ for systems that have been deployed (and many still working today) in the largest call centers in the USA, and consequently, in the world.

C++ has been my main programming language, but I’ve delved in C#, Java, and recently Python.

I’m also the self-appointed maintainer of es.cppreference.com (the Spanish companion site to cppreference.com).

okay thank you very much

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,440
so um this talk is a little bit lighter

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,039
than the than the other talks but it's

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
just as important

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,080
so in the movie field of dreams

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,199
kevin costner goes about and builds

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
a baseball field with the hope that the

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
greatest

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,559
baseball players in history would come

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,920
and play

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:40,000
so about 10 months ago i set out

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,280
to do something similar and

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,719
i started by translating a book

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,239
uh the book is c plus plus

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
17 the the complete guide so you can see

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
it

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,360
here somewhere there so

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,239
it is in spanish and think about this

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,400
how many of you can find quality

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:09,760
documentation in your native language

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,560
if you do then or if

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,439
a company or a community provides the

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
documentation

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,560
then you are empowering possibly right

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,080
thousands or hundreds of thousands of

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,159
people

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,280
so i set about then to translate

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,960
a site to spanish with c

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,880
plus plus documentation so

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,880
that side is um

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,240
escppreference.com this is the yada yada

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,640
i'm a lingua file sesquipedalian right c

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
plus plus enthusiast because every time

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,759
there's more so you don't

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,360
you're not an expert anymore so um

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,119
as i mentioned there i'm the translator

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,159
for that you can reach me at the

00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,000
email address that is there

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,560
so c plus plus documentation

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
in cpp reference is very popular if you

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
go

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,520
to that website however you may be aware

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,440
that there are many sides except sister

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
sites or brother sites

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,879
that are in uh in in a different

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,680
language

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
so you can see for example here the the

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
uh

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,480
spanish one right so the site was mostly

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,800
abandoned until recently as i mentioned

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
so the way that it was done is it was a

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,920
port of about

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,040
uh 2013 for most of c plus plus

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,360
some 11 some c plus 14 translation is a

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,080
mixed bag of uh that quickly discourages

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
there are

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
what we call errors big errors in in the

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
translators

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
not the people the automatic translators

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
no c plus plus

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,640
17 no c plus plus 20.

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,120
so this is the current status right now

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,920
uh most of the keywords expressions

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,159
declarations are done initialization

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,879
which takes a long time is done

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,599
a lot of uh for classes and specific

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,120
classes

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,400
c plus plus 11 and 17 classes uh some

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,480
c plus plus 20. right partial uh for

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,400
collections uh typically you do one and

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
you translate a ton of them

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,959
uh all of type traits i should say that

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,599
is completely done 100 11 14

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
17 and 20 did you know that there's over

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,799
100 type trades

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
uh several 17 uh features a few features

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,720
for c plus plus 20

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,799
uh 50 of name requirements all of the

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,319
core concepts and so on and so forth

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,840
compiler support is mostly up to date

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,440
so this is obviously a labor of love

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,200
so what this talk is about after all

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,360
this is to invite you

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
if you speak spanish right if you're a

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,239
spanish-speaking person

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,720
right if you can participate and help

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,879
right otherwise you can trust me i'll be

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
done probably in 2023 which would

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,239
we don't want because then we'll have c

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
plus plus 23 and i'll be starting all

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
over again so you can open an account

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
right or you can invite companies and

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
say hey can you pony up some resources

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
to translate the site maybe you can do

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
also

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
you know get an opportunity and link

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,000
this documentation

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
into visual studio code see lion

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,280
right maybe you can create one of those

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
plugins

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,799
so in essence it's the call to action if

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,199
you speak spanish

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,479
if you want to participate you are

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
invited

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,919
how can i contribute start small don't

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
do everything at a time many

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,160
translations take 5-10 minutes

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
you can pick a section right you can

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
translate only that section

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
and not the whole enchilada and by the

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,440
way don't use

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,759
the whole enchilada because that's slang

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,400
right translators are your frenemies

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,960
they do some things good something's bad

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,479
so

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,400
um you can follow the the tutorial

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,720
use a text editor you can do it on the

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,199
page here's an example right

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,280
make pair there's this big note that

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,919
says hey we need help here

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
but you can see in the circles the stuff

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
that is

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,840
incorrect right and then over here

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
this is the source code or the the

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
source text

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,479
how it looks once you you know you

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
complete it

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,840
and this is a bad example of a

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,039
translator an automatic translator

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,720
right in red that translates cast as the

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,520
cast in a movie

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
and the word character as the character

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,000
in a movie or

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,680
in a book which is incorrect right so

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
all of those things are incorrect so if

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,000
you're thinking about using

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
uh translate aromatic translators beware

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,400
you're gonna have to do

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,680
a lot of cleaning so saying that kudos

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,840
to everybody on e

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,840
and cppreference.com i don't know who

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,039
these users are i just know them by

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,479
uh their uh handle t cannons fruiterica

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,840
and space mission

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,840
uh wherever you are thank you very much

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
