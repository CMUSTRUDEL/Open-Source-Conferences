	00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,639
go

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,280
so um i feel like you guys want to maybe

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,880
have some

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
fun and talk about unicorns because i

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,720
heard some of you like unicorns

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,039
but again i come from a company that

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,480
likes to do nerd stuff with history

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
so i'm going to take your historical

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,640
perspectives on unicorns

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,240
the first historical marker i could find

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
about unicorns actually goes back to the

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,760
indus valley civilization which

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
as we all know is one of the free first

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,360
civilization uh recorded today

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,680
uh with uh along with uh ancient egypt

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,800
and

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,200
uh ancient mesopotamia and thousands of

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,600
years ago already people were using uh

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,399
unicorns as a mark of a high social rank

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
and and possibly like a clan sigil

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
um this later on translating to the

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
greeks uh and the first mention we can

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,039
find in the greeks is by theseus

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,719
who wrote a book about india which he

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,199
basically never went to

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
he literally heard stories about people

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,640
from persia

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
and wrote everything as natural history

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,040
most of

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,920
whatever he wrote has been debunked

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,119
since you can see a bunch of

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,880
illustration of

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
the kind of stuff you talked about but

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,080
somehow unicorns

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,680
went through that and aristotle and

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,240
other philosophers continue bringing it

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
up as

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
natural history that brings us to the

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,600
medieval ages which

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,960
of course when you have to take a legend

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,560
in the medieval ages you have to put

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
jesus there somewhere

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,479
so it became a symbol of purity and

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
chastity and it comes closer to the myth

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,759
of the unicorn we have today

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,640
it basically mixed up with an allegory

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,640
of the incarnation

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,320
and then the rulers started catching up

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,720
on that for example the king of denmark

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,560
claims to have a throne made of unicorn

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,799
horns you can actually see that today in

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
copenhagen of course it's not made of

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
actual unicorn's horn it's actually made

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
of novel tusks that he bought from the

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
norwegians which was actually a common

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
medieval scam back in the days

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
you would be sold like what's supposed

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,200
to be a miracle powder of unicorn horn

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
and it turned out to be just normal

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
tasks

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
but the resistance comes by and we start

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,520
having men of

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,119
discovery that try to figure out so

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,640
marco polo for example

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,800
during his travels tries to find a

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
source of unicorns and he claims to have

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
seen one

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
but he comes back and said guys this is

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
not what you thought i saw them and

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,160
they're ugly brutes

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,879
they are not at all such as we described

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
them

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,239
and if you follow his discovery you

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
figure out that actually

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,920
he just never seen a rhinoceros before

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
in his life and that's what he thought

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
was a unicorn

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
so much for great discovery but maybe we

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
can be saved by leonardo the greatest

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,280
inventor and scientist and just overall

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,120
great man of his time

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
who actually i don't know one day was

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,920
born and devised a way to capture a

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,640
unicorn that is

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,360
survives to us today in manuscripts he

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,920
said you bait it with a virgin

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,160
then you wait for it to go to sleep and

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,879
then you just catch it

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,319
and that's it i come on you man you're

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,200
the guy who invented like

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,599
tanks in the 15th 16th century you

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
invented airplanes and helicopters

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,760
you wrote a book about uh about an

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,720
absolutely you you you painted the mona

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,800
lisa

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
and the best thing you can come up with

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,680
is this

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
i'm disappointed but seriously though

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
what's the most important thing about

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,400
unicorn and i'm sorry to say this

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,120
but it's that that don't exist it's true

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,319
they don't exist yet somehow i keep

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,480
hearing people talk as if they do

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,840
in every industry i ever went through i

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,599
heard people saying stuff like oh this

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
problem is unique to us

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,120
oh our industry is unique answers that

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,959
nobody else ever had

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,720
you come from x you wouldn't understand

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
what i'm talking about and then they go

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,120
on

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
and they resent that saying you know

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
what nobody else's performance

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,360
constraints

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
nobody else has multiple disciplines

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
collaborating on the product

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
nobody else has deadline no difficult

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,720
customers nobody else has weird platform

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,720
it's only us

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,080
and so there's a bunch of things that

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
other people do that we can't have

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,400
because we're unique

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,959
we can't have c plus 11 14 17 20 picture

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
flavor

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,480
we can have third-party libraries we

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
call it unit testing

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,439
we can't have agile we can't have

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,720
continuous integration we can't have

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,480
continuous delivery

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
because we're unicorns and unicorns have

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
their own unique problems that nobody

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,040
ever had

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
except you're not a unicorn you're just

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,479
making bad excuses

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,560
because chances are someone else in the

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,639
world had had similar issues

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
you can ask john to give statistics

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
there i don't know how many

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,240
thousands hundreds of thousands maybe

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
see developer in the world

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
chances are somebody else found your

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
problem and solved it

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,639
so what i'm saying to you is look

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,040
outwards talk to your peers

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,720
including outside of your industry watch

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
talks read blogs good conferences you're

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
in a

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,840
great place right here to continue on

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,919
that and share your findings of course

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
because your alternative is end up like

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,840
this

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
thank you

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
