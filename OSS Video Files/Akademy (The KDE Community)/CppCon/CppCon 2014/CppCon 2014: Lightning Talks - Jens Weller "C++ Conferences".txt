Wow okay I'm pretty sure there's no math

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,630
in the next talk am i safe to say that

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,179
yeah cut the math out if you're gonna

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,549
have some bath no ah yen's is going to

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,039
talk because he is a speaker and visitor

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,869
of many an organizer of one c++

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,080
conference and he's going to do I can't

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,900
believe this is adorable that in 2014

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,789
there are so many C++ conferences that

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,890
we need to compare and contrast and

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,520
overview them I am absolutely delighted

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:42,840
that that is a topic for us so that is

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:45,329
our topic C++ conferences I have to

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,920
disappoint caton one on one special

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:56,489
point no it's not math c++ conferences

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,800
are in my opinion not comparable so I'm

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,850
obviously biased as I organized my own

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,920
conference so I kind of don't try to

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,860
compare them as they're different and

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:17,130
each one is special so that's a boring

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:19,530
thread about me so yeah let's get

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,689
started in in the topic so super spars

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,360
conferences I just made a list of

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:31,140
probably almost every C++ conference

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,610
which currently exists first and for all

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,820
we are currently at C++ cone as you

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:42,000
noticed I guess then there is c++ and

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,640
beyond there's C++ now there is a DC

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,790
which stands for advanced developer

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,000
conference in Bavaria meeting C++ my

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,770
very own conference this year in Berlin

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,360
qtf days and going native and you might

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,579
have noticed that there are a few

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,570
conferences of which you have heard or

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,619
which we attended yourself are missing

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:11,039
those are just is just a short list of

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:15,780
pure C++ conferences which are

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:19,920
also existing our conferences that have

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,379
a C++ track for example the ACC you the

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,989
NDC the Silicon Valley code camp which

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,470
also gets organized by the super star

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:30,659
trek by John Cobb and Microsoft's BUILD

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:37,439
conference also usually has a c++ track

00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:39,299
or several talks about C++ and thought I

00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,969
give you an overview where those

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:50,400
conferences are situated those are in

00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:53,180
Europe and um those are in America now

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,730
our think about it there is also a

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,750
conference like thing and japan called

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:03,919
boost study meeting where the japanese

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:07,200
boost seen usually meets a day or two to

00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,780
i'm not sure why conference like all of

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,849
us really a study meeting i have not

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,829
have never attended that so and I

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:18,930
probably don't intend to do it because

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:22,139
my Japanese is not very good so one

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,919
thing I would like to encourage you is

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:28,590
to speak at conferences because I think

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,479
it's a very good thing as a speaker and

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,180
I know that many many of you are

00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,129
speakers already in the room and I know

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,199
that many many of you in the room are

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:41,909
also half as a potential to present

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:44,760
something interesting about C++ and it's

00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,229
a great right training and you could

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,940
have started with a lightning talking I

00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,840
get some of you did start with lightning

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,079
talk at this conference if you interest

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,299
if you're interested in and speaking

00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:01,109
there's usually for each conference call

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,319
for paper where you can submit your talk

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:09,870
as a description and title usually and

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:13,250
usually submit a speaker bio and then

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,109
you usually get voted by a committee or

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,449
from meeting C++ to be edited this year

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,829
the first time that's attendees did vote

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,340
on the talks that was very successful

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,830
and

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:30,820
this result of the voting is basically

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:33,220
yeah the schedule almost so I decided to

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,169
give you an overview about three

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,570
different conferences which I have

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:43,540
visited three times or organized three

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:47,639
times and those are C++ now cute def

00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:56,020
days and my own conference of course too

00:04:47,639 --> 00:05:01,260
so here we are with C++ now um it's a

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,030
very nice conference as we see in essen

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,690
the weather is not always that good but

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,760
usually you have you have a very good

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,240
veteran s I've been three times now

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,130
there but what you what you definitely

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,729
should see is that asthma is very high

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:24,729
and they get to some other details about

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:28,030
SMU later c++ now effects it's a rather

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:32,800
small conference to 150 attendees it has

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:37,630
a very high code of how to say that of

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,599
really C++ professionals a Tessa its

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,030
past us and in the boost con conference

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,190
so it's a lot of people from the boost

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,200
community are there and it's a if you're

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,389
interested in boost this is one of the

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,770
best conferences you can go to and it

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,539
lasts like this conference five days but

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,070
it's a bit easier to choose the talks

00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:01,750
because you only have three parallel

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:04,720
tracks and as we saw in the previous

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,340
picture the conference itself is in a

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,410
park-like surrounding where you can

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,530
spend the brakes etc also in the park

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:22,030
it's very nice as always also also as I

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:24,130
already mentioned the conference has its

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,440
roots in the boost conference which

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,950
originally started there and asked me

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,479
and my opinion is a very very good

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,479
conference for c++ nerds

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,840
but it might be hard to get there

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:42,940
because this year um the the first

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:49,300
picture I showed you was also from this

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:53,470
year from friday or saturday this is a

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,710
few days earlier we had winter um i

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,420
think is a bits a tribute to the long

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,350
winter and the hard winter in north

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,960
america but as you should know that SMS

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:10,090
in the rockies you always have to to see

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,580
that snow as an option so when you're

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,870
coming to smu i definitely have to to

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,800
bring summer and winter clothes and

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,060
basically switch during the day because

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,690
the nights are really cool and awesome

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:26,380
and you also should be aware that sm has

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,480
quite a higher altitude so doing sports

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:33,130
etcetera earnestness sometimes a bit

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:36,610
difficult for people topics usually

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:41,170
general c++ boost standard C++ you know

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,390
just the shed yourself of the last

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:48,760
year's is always available which you can

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:53,680
look through and further details about

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,450
C++ now are at their website which

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,050
brings me to the cute developer days

00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:04,030
which are specialized conference um this

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,820
year again now for the third year I

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:10,470
think an emboldened European version and

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,720
there's also a version in San Francisco

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:19,240
as we see on the next slide which is in

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,100
November and Ordonez in October and the

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,860
two day conference in front of the

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,380
conference there's a training day you

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,840
can book the straining separately so

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,680
that your Canada attend to all three

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,840
days or just the conference if you knew

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,070
too cute the training data is very good

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,020
if you already have done a lot with cute

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,370
you might should think about if there's

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,290
a training that fits your needs

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,660
currently or just change the corner

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,290
I usually now skip the training day the

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,029
first years I was there it was very good

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,490
but now I don't need it anymore i work

00:08:52,029 --> 00:09:00,160
every day was cute yeah it's a bit older

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,730
already from the conference it has a

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,350
long history and cute is not only C++ so

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:10,089
the topics on this conference are not

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:13,149
only C++ are of course cute is a big

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,790
topic qml the platforms developing for

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:18,850
different platforms was cute and C++ is

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:22,509
also a topic so they also have talks

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,040
like what is new and C++ 11 but it's

00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:25,630
less important for the conference and

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,069
cute is really the main focus if you

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:32,230
don't like you just should not go there

00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:35,440
and details are on cute f-test calm

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,060
which will lead you to both websites for

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,610
both conferences in Europe and in

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:47,220
America which brings me to my very own

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,220
beloved conference meeting C++ 2014

00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,190
meeting C++ is a little bit more than a

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:58,389
conference you see the history we had

00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:01,569
for the last two years quite a little

00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,089
bit of growth and for this year we also

00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:09,600
have 50 students which are sponsored by

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:09,600
a company called think they'll um and

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,899
yeah it's also website and blog for c++

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,269
and one of my goals as I started meeting

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:22,779
C++ was not always not not also the

00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:24,790
conference but also trying to get more

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,850
user groups started and I talk about

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,260
that tomorrow but back to the conference

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,740
as I mentioned it's this year in Berlin

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,360
for the first time on and it's probably

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,449
going to stay also in Berlin for the

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,829
next year's i hope the tropics are

00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:45,100
general C++ libraries like boost cute

00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:47,639
standard C++ this year we have a theme

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,930
track each year this year this will be

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,450
scientific programming and with C++ so

00:10:51,930 --> 00:11:02,280
we have a focus on

00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:06,840
Marik's and threading etc and the the

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:12,420
program was chosen the program was

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:15,000
chosen by a voting so we had over 50

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,420
talks which got submitted and the voting

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,550
helped me tremendously to actually

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:27,120
choose the right program for the

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:29,310
conference yeah it's two days conference
