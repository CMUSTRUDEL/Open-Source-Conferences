Leor Zolman has been involved in system software/compiler development, system administration, application development, and education for 40 years, spanning the CP/M, UNIX, and Windows operating systems.

Leor is the author of The BD Software C Compiler (“BDS C”, 1979), the first native-code C compiler targeted exclusively for personal computers.

In the early 90’s, Leor was a member of the technical staff of R&D Publications, where he wrote columns for R&D’s magazines: The C/C++ Users Journal, Windows Developer’s Journal, and SysAdmin, and he also authored the first book ever published by R&D Books: Illustrated C.

More recently, in addition to designing and delivering on-site training courses on C, C++, Java, Perl, and Unix, Leor wrote STLFilt: An STL Error Message Decryptor for C++, a Freeware tool for simplification of complex (i.e., unreadable) template-related C++ error diagnostics.

When not engaged in learning or teaching C++, you may find Leor administering and participating in several financial discussions boards, riding his BMW R1200RT, playing tennis or showing people the Ring Nebula through his LX200GPS telescope at star parties around the North Shore Boston area.
