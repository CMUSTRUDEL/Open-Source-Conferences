The BDE libraries, https://github.com/bloomberg/bde, provide a wide range of 
useful functionality and also showcase the design and testing principles long 
advocated by John Lakos (see Lakos '96, CppCpon 201[456]): 
Fine-grained, hierarchical reusable (physical) components 
Focused component purposes based on well-defined class categories. 
Use of library facilities to implement effective Defensive Programming. 
Ubiquitous support for a user-supplied memory--allocation mechanisms. 
Design by (appropriately narrow) contracts. 
After an outline of the functionality provided (e.g., date/time classes, 
logging), this talk recaps the above Lakosian ideas, and shows, through BDE 
documentation and code examples, how the ideas above influence the use of BDE libraries in applications.
