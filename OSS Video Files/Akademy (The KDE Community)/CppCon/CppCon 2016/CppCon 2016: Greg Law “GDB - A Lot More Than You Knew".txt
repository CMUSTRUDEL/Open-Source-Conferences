If you’re writing C++ for anything other than Windows, chances are that you occasionally break out GDB. This session presents some of the lesser known features of GDB that can change the way you debug. GDB has come a long way in the last few years and now does so much more than break, print, step and continue. Reversible debugging; Non-Stop Mode; Multi-process Debugging; and Dynamic Printf are but some of its best features, and its built-in Python scripting is particularly powerful. Join Undo co-founder and CEO, Greg Law, as he takes you through a series of demos to show some amazing tricks with GDB and some of its powerful new (and not-so-new) features that you may not have heard of.
