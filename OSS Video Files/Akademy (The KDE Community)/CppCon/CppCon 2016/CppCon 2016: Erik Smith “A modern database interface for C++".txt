C++ has historically had many options for database connectivity but has lacked a standard interface that other languages, such as Java, have had for a long time. This talk will present a standards grade interface along with experience with a reference implementation that includes support for at least 6 databases. A key aspect of the design is to show how modern C++ features can be used to achieve a high degree of both efficiency and ease-of-use. Specific features to be covered will include type conversion, connection pooling, I/O binding for scalars and arrays, row sets, direct/polymorphic interfaces, policy based design, the driver interface, and details on the implementation. Forward looking standards proposals, such as ranges and variants, will also be included in the discussion.
