There has always been great interest in imperative compile-time control flow: as an example, consider all the existing `static_if` proposals and the recently accepted `constexpr_if` construct for C++17. 

What if you were told that it is actually possible to implement imperative control flow in C++14? 

In this tutorial, the implementation and design of a compile-time `static_if` branching construct and of a compile-time `static_for` iteration construct will be shown and analyzed. These constructs will then be compared to traditional solutions and upcoming C++17 features, examining advantages and drawbacks.
