Hashes and caches, why another hash library ? 
Problems,shortcomings and advantages of current open source hash libraries. Includes split between open and closed addressing methods and how these can be combined to give a better solution without much trade off by exploiting the strengths of each. 

Benchmarks 
Benchmarks of the library with high and medium entropy data, mostly pictures. 

Analogies 
A short description of the algorithms employed and why they work. This will include a short history of the library and why certain design decisions where made. Use of the birthday problem to model the low memory use evident from the benchmarks. 

Practical uses 
Demonstrate use cases of the library in treestore MySQL storage engine. Uses include concurrent version control algorithms and a mostly lock free allocation pool. This will include a short session with facebook link bench to illuminate possible advantages.
