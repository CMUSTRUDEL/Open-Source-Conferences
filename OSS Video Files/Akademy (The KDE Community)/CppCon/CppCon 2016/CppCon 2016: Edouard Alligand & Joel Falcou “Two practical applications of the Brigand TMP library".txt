Metaprogramming isn’t always easy to apprehend and the purpose of this talk is to show through the resolution of two real life problems where it can be applied to increase productivity and reliability. The first case study will exhibit how we can use TMP to allocate at compile time the required memory for serializing simple structures such as a pair of integers. The second case study will be about generating a memory layout for array of structures perfectly fit for the targeted platform. The examples are based on the Brigand TMP library and will be an opportunity to see how MP constructs such as collection of types and compile time algorithms are made and when they should be used. The talk might contain obscure jokes related to pastries naming.
