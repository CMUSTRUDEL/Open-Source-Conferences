In 1997, the MAME project was started as a DOS application written in C. Initially it could emulate a single arcade game, but today we have over 30,000 games. During the years, the code base grew but until 2009, there were no big steps. Then we started using C++.  

This case study will show how moving from C and plain C++ to modern C++ benefited both developers and end users, how we got better compatibility and portability, and better code. We will also discuss libraries that we feel are missing from the standard and the libraries that we are sharing with the community.
