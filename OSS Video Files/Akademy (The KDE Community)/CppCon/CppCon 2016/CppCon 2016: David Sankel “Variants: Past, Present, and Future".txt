What are variants, why are they important, and how I use them? Once available to a developer, variants become one of the most commonly used tools in everyday programming. This talk will explore the venerable Boost.Variant library, discuss the improvements made by C++17’s std::variant＜＞, and close with a discussion of the exciting new language-based variant and pattern matching papers (proposed for C++20). This talk aims to be of practical utility in variant library usage and informative as to where things are heading.
