hi so you might have heard about the

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,230
review community we launched it I can

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,730
around August

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,009
let's just focus on reviewing CPAs most

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,920
libraries and I decided to talk about

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,470
this shortly and so this started was a

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,350
tweet by Eric and last year by October

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,330
he was kind of asking why don't we have

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,920
such a community or why don't why

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,689
doesn't that something like the success

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,730
too would be cool to have that and I was

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,489
thinking about something similar for a

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,380
while and but what really got me started

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,450
see that person now I gave a talk on

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,410
comparing the the boost and the acute

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,989
communities and also this got me kind of

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,030
starting and to thinking what would we

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,539
need today as a community or what we

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,950
want to have today as a community and so

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,430
this kind of manifested then as

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,030
[Music]

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,430
subreddit which is now reality it's

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,370
under see if we review our session

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,199
review on a reddit and there's gotta be

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,049
an upcoming list meaning see first was

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:12,240
at my website of the libraries which

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,790
actually passed this review and so the

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,090
the idea about reviews I was thinking

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,950
about how should we review so I would

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,650
like to to have like that you know of

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,450
course we focus on one binary and then

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,240
there's one better thread for that which

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,970
is kind of use at the forum and there's

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,210
discussions etc but just you know what

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,420
should read a review really be if you

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,040
look at boost we have a review manager

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,579
you are supposed to invest some time

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,920
into it we really have like a high

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,200
expectation on such a review and as high

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,170
volume and it's like 600 emails and I

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,750
don't know if emails are still the best

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:58,259
medium to do reviews and while ago robot

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,850
Remy did great initiative by setting up

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,890
the boost Library incubator but we have

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,180
some barriers here you can most of us

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,830
already have read it account

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,600
this is like a local website so you have

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,610
to create it local web login into the

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,930
WordPress account there and also

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,730
unfortunately though robot launched this

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,520
a couple of years ago and presented at

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,280
the boost but I kind of wanted a there's

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,830
a kind of a missing integration to boost

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:32,160
off that so and in comparison to to what

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,250
I currently plan as I don't want our CP

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,370
review to be as focused and as strict as

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,500
boost reviews are so we don't have such

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:45,780
a high quality standard as boost and we

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:50,940
aim more at providing a different view

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:53,459
on on a library so from from boost

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,990
coming and I see like a lot of what we

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,640
do in reviews for this conference so

00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,180
it's like often like experts only when

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,240
we have like this expert Carleton C++

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,730
everyone wants to be cutting-edge and on

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,680
the contrary I kind of think actually if

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,290
it really would library we should have

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,410
like the contribution of everyone and it

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,640
should be a group effort maybe because I

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,450
found this great core like in the

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,489
beginner's mind there are many

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,900
possibilities but in the experts there

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,830
are a few and maybe some of those

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,560
possibilities which the beginners see

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,239
today are things which an expert only

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,040
doesn't see because he comes from a

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,989
different time so for for people which

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,640
are not yet expert so I want to go there

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,620
or want to just don't want to have

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,650
there's lots of hanging fruit like

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,050
documentation code readability code

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,700
smells just look through the code don't

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,280
like something or I think this is wrong

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,750
just got my assesses then you can ask

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,070
them to separate it and discuss with

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,280
south order and other people can

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,830
contribute to that and of course you can

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,450
also do the anon so low-hanging fruit

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,190
like you can try it yourself in at

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,450
fussing the library and static analyzers

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,959
there's lots of things you can do and

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:12,360
[Music]

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:14,639
then as this group effort the the beacon

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,079
any contribution then adds to the sum

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,420
and we have the exchange with the Deaf's

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,040
from the library we can discuss

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,880
and of course you get to rent on someone

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,420
else's code and you can learn so to

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,280
summarize my process like more feedback

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,210
oriented I don't want to be as strict as

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,970
boosters and

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:37,890
the RCP reddit is the place to go and I

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,050
see this feedback to you know kind of

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,140
like from from from everyone and all

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,410
contributions I welcome the review is

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,840
one months and after that it's public

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,490
and people can later go and see but the

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,550
responsibility is still by the library

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,660
developer and yeah so libraries is just

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,780
you know the normal thing which we

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,340
expect from libraries and I I expect

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,230
like the library author I want them to

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,790
have the freedom to to do their choices

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,390
what they won't like this like both

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:09,590
systems etc and same for developers and

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,590
