	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,810
so I was here in this estate last year

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,210
trying to convince you not to use : I

00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,759
gave five solid reasons but apparently I

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,940
didn't do very well so I'm trying again

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,699
I'm giving you another five reasons not

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,710
to use :

00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:22,439
so the first one because billion from

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,740
source is better I Google told us this

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,840
morning binaries are very difficult so

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,300
instead in our company we have just

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,969
given up we have a better alternative we

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,570
are giving our developers in the welcome

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,000
pack a Holy Grail so this is the happy

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:45,510
face of our youngest developer when we

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,399
finally released version 1.0 also

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,059
another one because supporting multiple

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,910
system is suboptimal actually the other

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,699
day my company I was I was deep in in

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,190
the in the codebase and I found two

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,070
libraries with a legacy dual system so I

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,769
went to my team and say hey I want to

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,360
change to our build system and they they

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,400
were so happy big they couldn't stop

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,010
laughing and and then I went to my

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,170
manager and he was also so happy that he

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,659
bought me a ticket to see people on a

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,640
one-way ticket yeah and also there are

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,500
many alternatives why :

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,500
if there are many other options there I

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,020
wish I could point you to to any of them

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,049
but as there are no public metrics

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,670
anywhere we can't compare or you cannot

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,530
know about the trends of these

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,850
alternatives just just pick any other

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,610
one you will be fine yeah this is evil

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,380
it is a very bad thing it has been

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,450
acquired by Jeff oh and you know

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,950
open-source developers they work much

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,430
better when they are hungry so so yeah

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,380
yeah yeah that's a fact and if it's

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,060
angry and they are also working late

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,719
because they have another table to play

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,040
then the code is perfect so so this is a

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,290
terrible mistake

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,880
and the worse thing is that they are

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,520
doubling down they're hiring more people

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,069
so this is a receive our site for

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,670
disaster so please don't send them any

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,670
CV

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,820
finally the last one last year I was

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,400
saying okay it's not mainstream I have

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,070
to confess I've hacked their internal

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,430
analytics they have hundreds of

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,830
companies using Conan but it's fine I'm

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,600
a troll

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:37,550
so a reason for noticin connects because

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,870
it's too mainstream why not

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,810
the truth is that I I'm not that

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,300
creative so so these reasons are not

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,880
mine they are found on the Internet

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,860
you know the ultimate source of truth of

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:55,920
knowledge yeah so and the truth is that

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,400
we if we get barbarian and then we mix

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,280
it with with frog we make him green who

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,310
make it jump we'll get something

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,440
incredible we will get a package major

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,480
from C and C++ and it will be

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,980
unstoppable it would be : package

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:18,190
manager thank you

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,190
