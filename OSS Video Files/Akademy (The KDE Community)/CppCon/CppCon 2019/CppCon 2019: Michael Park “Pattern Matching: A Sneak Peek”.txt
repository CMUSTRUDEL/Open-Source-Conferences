Pattern matching brings a declarative approach to destructuring and inspecting complex data types. It’s a very powerful abstraction provided by many programming languages such as Haskell and OCaml, and more recently, Rust, Scala, and Swift.

In this talk, we’ll discuss the proposal in flight (https://wg21.link/p1371) to add pattern matching as a language feature in the C++. We’ll discuss why pattern matching is more relevant today to C++ than ever before, examples of how pattern matching simplifies the structure of code, and discuss the details of the concrete features being proposed.

The goal of the talk is to build an intuition for pattern matching, and gather feedback of the state of an early stage proposal.
