In this talk I will present an advancement on the Compile Time Regular Expression (CTRE) library. The library was designed with new C++20 features, and it uses novel techniques. This presentation independently sums up the work since my previous CppCon talk about the library.

The primary topic of this talk will be an explanation of the new Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) engine in the library and how it's built and optimised during compilation. I will explain the differences and limitations of the new engine in comparison to the previous Back Tracking engine. I will address these differences with a benchmark and I will discuss the generated assembly.

Even if you are not interested in regular expressions, you will learn new techniques in compile-time meta-programming and see new C++20 features in action.
