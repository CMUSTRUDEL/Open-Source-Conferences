As a community we've tried many different ways to express, propagate and handle error conditions in our code over the years. Each seem to have different trade-offs, with none being perfect in all cases.

This presentation is the follow-up to my earlier talk, "Option(al) Is Not a Failure", where I surveyed existing error-handling approaches and score them against each other, leading up to the new proposal, p0709, "Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions".

We'll summarise some of that background so we're all on the same page, but in this talk we're going to dig into the proposal in more depth - and look at the supporting proposals, p1028 (std::error) and p1029 ([[move relocates]]) and others. We'll also comment similar mechanisms in other languages, notably Swift, to get an idea of how it might work out in practice.
