C++ is a success story. One reason is its backward compatibility.
But that also makes C++ more or more unteachable.
Too many features, too many rules, too many inconsistences.

So, the only solution (beside clean-ups for simple rules) are good style guides.
However, these style guides contradict significantly.
For example, while some recommend to define operations as non-member non-friend,
others recommend to use hidden friends.
Or when should we define virtual destructors?
Or the details of the rule of 0, 3, 5, "5 or 3".
Or how to initialize an object.

I have no clear solution.
But it's time to open the stage for a consolidation of the situation.
At least in the interest of all the average programmers who do not know all the rules (well, yes, nobody does).
