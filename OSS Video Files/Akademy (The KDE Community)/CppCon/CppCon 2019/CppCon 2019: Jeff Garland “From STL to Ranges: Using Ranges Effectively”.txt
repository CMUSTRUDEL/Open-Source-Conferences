This course provides a survey of C++20 ranges and their application. Ranges are the largest revamp of the Standard Template Library (STL) in 20 years and will impact daily C++ programming dramatically. Some of the changes seem minor, but full utilization of ranges is much more transformational to coding practice.

The tutorial goes beyond the basics to explore what's behind the library. For example, understand the key differences between algorithms and views and when to apply them.  Chock full of example code this tutorial will bootstrap programmer's usage of std::ranges.
