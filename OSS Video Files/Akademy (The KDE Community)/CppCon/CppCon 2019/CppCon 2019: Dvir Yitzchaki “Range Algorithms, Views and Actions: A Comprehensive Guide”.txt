STL algorithms are something every C++ programmer should know. With ranges being voted in C++ 20, there are even more useful tools that we should at least be aware of, if not use daily.

Using ranges helps writing a code which is great in expressiveness and safety and does not fall behind in performance. In this talk we will cover what ranges add to the C++20 standard library, as well as go over all the different views and actions available in range-v3 library which can be used today.

This talk is inspired by Jonathan Boccara’s talk "105 algorithms in less than an hour".
