Modern C++ attributes such as [[noreturn]] and [[deprecated]] can be used to improve code quality and programmer productivity. They provide valuable information to the compiler, allowing it to generate more efficient code and provide more useful warning messages. C++20 is slated to include several new attributes, including [[no_unique_address]] and the design-by-contract attributes. They also let you use compiler extensions on specific toolchains without locking you into using only those toolchains.

This session explores several C++ attributes and provides examples of how to use each one to improve your programs. Although it focuses on the standard attributes, it also includes examples of non-standard attributes from specific toolchains.
