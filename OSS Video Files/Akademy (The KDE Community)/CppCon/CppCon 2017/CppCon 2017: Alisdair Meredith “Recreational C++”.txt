C++ is a language full of curiosities, and entices the curious. This session will will walk through half a dozen little code explorations of ideas that might have been solved in 5 minutes, but piqued my curiosity to keep digging and see just how completely or thoroughly they might be solved, and what we can learn about the language and the way it holds together along the way. Fundamentally, it is about the joy of exploring code long after the problem has been solved, to find those satisfying solutions to problems that don't need solving! 

There will not be much deep learning; instead, there will be numerous insights into corners of the language that are often (for good reason!) unexplored, that might help with the big picture when debugging some obscure bugs. In particular, constexpr and templates will be exercised, and some compiler limits may be tested. We will demonstrating code that will the the gamut of C++98 though to C++17, and even poke into experimental pending features such as concepts.

Alisdair Meredith: Bloomberg LP, Senior Software Developer

Alisdair Meredith is a software developer at BloombergLP in New York, and the C++ Standard Committee Library Working Group chair.

He has been an active member of the C++ committee for just over a decade, and by a lucky co-incidence his first meeting was the kick-off meeting for the project that would become C++11, and also fixed the contents of the original library TR.

He is currently working on the BDE project, BloombergLP's open source libraries that offer a foundation for C++ development, including a standard library implementation supporting the polymorphic allocator model proposed for standardization.
