The main focus of this talk will be about the importance of lockless containers and RCU technology. The value of this approach will be explained and why it was added to libGuarded. I will also cover recent changes made to the RCU containers. 

I will explain the importance of libGuarded and how it was used in the CsSignal library to prevent deadlocks. 

Either basic familiarity with multithreading or attendance in Part I of this talk is suggested.
