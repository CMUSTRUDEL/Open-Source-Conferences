constexpr: in C++11, a curiosity; in C++14, viable for more uses; now with added power, in C++17 will it become an important tool in the programmer's toolkit? 

In this talk we will examine the possibilities and power of constexpr and explore what can (and what should) be done at compile-time with C++17. We'll present techniques for building constexpr data structures and algorithms, and look at what the standard provides and where it can improve. We'll also explore constexpr use of user defined literals for expressive compile-time abstractions. 

Compile-time computation offers perhaps the ultimate zero-cost abstraction, and this talk attempts to gauge the power available with C++17 constexpr.
