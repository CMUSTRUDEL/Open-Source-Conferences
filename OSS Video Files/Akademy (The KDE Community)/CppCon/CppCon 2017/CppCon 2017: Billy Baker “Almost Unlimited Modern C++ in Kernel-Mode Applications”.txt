Rian Quinn's "Making C++ and the STL Work in the Linux/Windows Kernels" from CppCon 2016 showed the difficulty of making C++ code work correctly in kernel mode. For some real-time systems, though, developing C++ applications that run in kernel mode "just works" as most of the necessary runtime support for Modern C++ is already available. Platform limitations, though, can offset the development gains that come with easy access to hardware.

This talk will present a variety of issues — such as limited filesystem functionality, missing memory protection, limited debugging and performance monitoring tools, and constrained resources — that impact usage of standard C++ functionality and require additional due diligence on the part of the developer. Topics will include testing in user mode; kernel-mode exceptions; and programming the Intel performance monitoring hardware.

Billy Baker: FlightSafety International, Senior Staff Software Engineer

Billy Baker has developed deterministic real-time flight simulation software using C++ for FlightSafety International, Evans and Sutherland and Boeing since 1997. At C++ committee meetings, he can most likely be found in LWG. He received his B.S. and M.S in Applied Mathematics from the University of Tulsa and is currently working on a Ph.D. in Computer Science. If asked, he will tell stories from his research semester at NCSA when web browsers did not yet have forms support.Website: http://www.flightsafety.com
