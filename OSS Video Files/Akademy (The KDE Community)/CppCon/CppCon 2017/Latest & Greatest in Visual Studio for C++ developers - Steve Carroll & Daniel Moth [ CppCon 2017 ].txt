Visual Studio 2017 was released this year and brings all sort of new functionality for C++ developers on any platform, not just Windows. In this talk, we'll cover many of the new features of the latest update of Visual Studio 2017 and give you a preview of new features coming in a major update later in 2017 that we've never shared before since you came to visit our hometown! We'll cover the ongoing evolution of our compiler and libraries, giving you an update on our conformance work as well as performance, and build throughput. We'll talk about the new enhancements to our Linux targeting. We'll talk about brand new unit testing capabilities for major test frameworks. We'll talk about improved support for CMake and our Open Folder experience for getting full Visual Studio IDE support for code that doesn't have a project or solution file. We'll also walk you through some cool new productivity and debugger features.
