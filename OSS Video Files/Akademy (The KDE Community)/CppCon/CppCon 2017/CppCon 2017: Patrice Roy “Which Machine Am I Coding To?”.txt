When writing a C++ program, we tend to think of the strengths and weaknesses of our computer, just as we think of our algorithms, data structures, and probably of language features we want to use (or we want to avoid), and we code accordingly. 

To some, it might be surprising to learn that C++ is actually specified in terms of an abstract machine, with its own characteristics. If this is indeed a surprise for you, then you might be interested in knowing more about this machine. It's been there for a long time, and it influences the way we program as well as the way the language was, and is. 

The aim of this talk is to provide a practical overview of what the C++ abstract machine is, how it affects the way we program and how it affects language design itself. It will probably most interesting to intermediate audiences who would like a closer look to some of the abstract underpinnings of the language.

Patrice Roy: Université de Sherbrooke / Collège Lionel-Groulx, Professor

Patrice Roy has been playing with C++, either professionally, for pleasure or (most of the time) both for over 20 years. After a few years doing R&D and working on military flight simulators, he moved on to academics and has been teaching computer science since 1998. Since 2005, he’s been involved more specifically in helping graduate students and professionals from the fields of real-time systems and game programming develop the skills they need to face today’s challenges. The rapid evolution of C++ in recent years has made his job even more enjoyable. He’s been a participating member in the ISO C++ Standards Committee since late 2014 and has been involved with the ISO Programming Language Vulnerabilities Committee since late 2015. He has five kids, and his wife ensures their house is home to a continuously changing number of cats, dogs and other animals.
