The C++ videos can be viewed in multiple languages by an audience a few dozen times broader than today.
If you are a speaker and want your videos to be viewed by the whole world but not just by English-speakers then you can facilitate translation by providing original captions and translating to other languages you speak.
If you regularly analyse C++ videos in details, translate the fragments of it for yourself and would like to benefit the other people's translation then why not sharing the translation with the community? If you want your name to be recognizable you can write your name in the translation you submit.
If you are interested in C++ videos with captions/translations then there is a resource that gathers in one place the links to C++ videos in the language of your interest - http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:captions-catalog.
This talk tells how you can participate in this initiative and what you can get from it.

	00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,650
As I promised during the lightning talk,

00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,869
today I'm going to tell you about the C++ video captioning and translating initiative

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,579
named the "C++ Video Access Project," cppvap.wikidot.com.

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,209
Not all of you have seen my lightning talk; that is why I will briefly remind the answer to the primary philosophical question:

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
What do we need this all for?

00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,269
Here is the answer.

00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:39,099
The maximum number of people in the room during a plenary session is within about 1500.

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,000
The session is recorded and then viewed.

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,290
The number of video views is at least a hundred times more.

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,329
Another important fact is that this number is still growing every month, and will continue growing for a few more years.

00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,299
I recently heard that YouTube counts not just the number of views, but the number of unique accounts that viewed the video.

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,120
If that is true, then this number is likely to reflect the actual number of people who have viewed the video, probably more than once.

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,880
Thus the main impact of a modern tech talk is not on the live viewers, but on the video viewers.

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,040
To make the story short, here's the picture.

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,380
These (at the top of the pyramid) are the live viewers in the room. These are the English-speaking video viewers.

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,000
These (middle of the pyramid) are the English-readers: those who understand written English, but not spoken.

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,639
And these (base of the pyramid) are those who don't understand English.

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,479
These people currently just don't watch the C++ videos.

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,709
They get nothing out of our conferences. The delivery of C++ content to these people: that's what we need this all for.

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,009
Now, how to deliver the content.

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,699
YouTube supports video translations in the form of captions.

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,869
Thus we need to create and add those captions. How to do that?

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,589
There are a number of YouTube help videos and pages that try to help.

00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
However, they are somewhat out-of-date.

00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:03,339
YouTube is software. It's growing; it gets redesigned.

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,670
It changes.

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,899
After I had watched YouTube help videos, it took me some time to put all the pieces together like a puzzle in order to get the full picture.

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,420
That is why I'd like to show you briefly how the captioning and translation works today.

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,460
Before that I need to let you know that I have manager permission for the YouTube channel "BoostCon",

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,800
which is the previous name of the C++Now conference; and CppCon.

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,640
That is why some of the screens available for me may not be available for a general YouTube user.

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Here is how to see the captions.

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,630
If the captions cover some part of the screen, you can drag them to where you like.

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,659
You can also customize some other settings.

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,810
This affects your own preferences only.

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,920
But before you can see the captions, they need to be created, submitted, and published. That's what is called "community contributions."

00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,290
For the YouTube channels CppCon, MeetingC++, and BoostCon, community contributions are enabled. That is the menu item.

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,510
"Add subtitles/CC" is available.

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
The channels are ready for captioning.

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,649
Experiments have shown that translation is a relatively simple, fast, and straightforward job if based on quality English captions.

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,820
So the first and the most important step is original English captioning.

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,939
Here is how to provide the English captions.

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,660
English captioning is not fast, but we are not alone here.

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,989
YouTube provides auto-generated English captions.

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,899
They have multiple errors, like the punctuation, but they save some typing and time synchronizing.

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,300
As you see, you mostly need to edit the auto-generated captions and fix some timing.

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,960
This YouTube help video provides more details, hotkeys, et cetera. What the video does not say is a trick that helped me a lot.

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:57,000
I do this...

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,879
[SPEAKER IN VIDEO, SLOWED DOWN] "I don't understand mo-- most of the things that they're talking about..."

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,830
And the speaker becomes much more captioning friendly.

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,120
If you are a conference presenter, then you are in a unique position here.

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:21,470
Even if the audio was not recorded properly, you know exactly what you were saying or what the question from the audience was.

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,229
You can even remember who in particular asked the question, and write that name in the captions.

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
I want to address an important point.

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,120
Our goal here is to spread good C++ ideas as widely as possible --- not to document a historical event.

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,769
We want captions to capture the best intent of the presenter --- not what they happen to say.

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:48,649
Please delete unnecessary words, like "So... well... you know... it's like... uh..."

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,979
Delete delayed sentences, false starts, or anything else that isn't contributing to the presentation of the ideas.

00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,880
Captioning is a unique opportunity to go back in time and make corrections.

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
For example, if you loosely quoted Scott [Meyers],

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,660
captioning gives you the opportunity to get the quote worded exactly right. Plus, it may turn out you were quoting Andrei [Alexandrescu]!

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,130
Or: you know if you intended to mention something during the talk but forgot.

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,060
It may feel incorrect somehow to change what was said, but fidelity to history is less important than fidelity to intent.

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,710
Fixage is good.

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,229
Briefly speaking, you know what captions best capture the intent of your presentation.

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,430
So, if you are the presenter, then you are the best captioner possible.

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:41,500
The page tips for captioners and translators give some more advice. If you want to get credit like this,

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,259
then click this check mark. You can also do it later.

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,390
Feel free to add any info about the captioner at the end of the captions.

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,939
If you would like to support our initiative then feel free to add the link to the community wiki [cppvap.wikidot.com].

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,269
After you are done, press "Submit contribution." The captions get submitted for review.

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,549
The YouTube Help says that the captions are reviewed by the viewers,

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,109
and once enough approval statistics are gathered, the captions get published automatically.

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,710
But so far I have never seen that mechanism working.

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,060
That is why I would recommend you not to wait until your submitted captions get reviewed.

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,020
Instead, get in touch either with me for the CppCon or BoostCon channels, or with the appropriate YouTube channel owner.

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,870
The simplest way to let me know is over Slack.

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,689
Not yet on Slack? Go to here.

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,180
After you join the cpplang Slack team, join the #cppvap channel.

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Then write to me something like, "@kuzmin_robin, please publish my captions for the CppCon 2017 video named..."

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,800
let's say, "Captioning and Translating C++ Videos."

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,439
If you have a wikidot.com account, then another simple way to let me know is with a private message right on the wiki.

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,100
Once I get your message, I'll go to YouTube... as CppCon channel manager... and to the "community contributions" section...

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,040
and will review your captions.

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,389
If you are a presenter, then you know better than I do what captions should be there.

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,789
In such cases, I accelerate my review using this trick.

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,559
I usually look for major or evident issues. If I see any, I let you know.

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
In any case, I typically press "Publish."

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,230
After that, you can see the captions published.

00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,930
Afterwards you can make fixes if needed.

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
There is one more important step.

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,020
After your contribution is published,

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,059
please go to the catalog of available captions and translations and add your record following the example of the existing ones.

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,550
This requires a wikidot.com account.

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,619
It is nice if the record contains the direct link to the video session abstract,

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,399
speaker info, slides, and whatever the viewer might need.

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,800
Please keep the record sorted by language, conference, year, and alphabetically otherwise.

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,939
Feel free to propose and implement your own mechanism of keeping the catalog

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,289
such that the records can be sorted or filtered like in a spreadsheet or a database.

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,919
Now it is time for translating.

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,809
The procedure is pretty much the same as the original English captioning, except for a tiny difference.

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:50,559
You can write your translation by yourself, or you can press "Autotranslate" and edit the autotranslation. That's the only difference.

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:59,739
Don't forget to get credit! Feel free to write your info at the end of your translation --- and provide a link to the wiki.

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:06,790
See? When we have quality English captions, well time-synchronized, the translating is so easy and fast.

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,999
Multiple people can work together on the same translation.

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,120
Multiple translations can be worked on in parallel.

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's it for captioning.

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,530
You can find more info on the wiki. But on one page I'd like to stop in detail:

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,739
It is "What is Missing in YouTube?"

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,280
If you are a YouTube developer then please visit this page. It is a ready-made list of feature requests.

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,440
Currently I, as a captioner, translator, reviewer, and publisher, miss the following features.

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,500
If the video has translations but the viewer does not know it,

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,229
then nothing tells the viewer that the translation can be turned on, and how to do that.

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,020
I remember one of YouTube's help videos or pages

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,349
mentioned something like that, but didn't provide any screenshots or videos, and I have never seen that working.

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,779
I'd like the video owners to be able to enable for all the videos a reminder for the viewers at the beginning of the video

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,229
that translations are available and how to turn them on.

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,909
So whenever a video is captioned or translated, that reminder should trigger.

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,930
The YouTube feature named "Cards," like on this example, requires manual intervention on every video

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,349
and can only be done by the channel owners, not by the community.

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,380
Sometimes not only the presenter's speech needs to be translated, but the slides also.

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:33,050
It would be nice to have multiple captions at the same time: one translating speech and the other translating the slides, both scrolled and positioned independently.

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,860
Sometimes more than one person speaks in the video. It would be nice to be able to show the captions in different colors for different people.

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,410
Recently, while preparing this presentation,

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,890
I noticed on the CppCon channel some new captions submitted for review. The first time I saw them,

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,809
YouTube was saying that they were submitted a week ago.

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,289
This means that for one week I wasn't aware that the new captions had been submitted for review.

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,519
I, as a channel manager, would like to get an email about the new community contributions,

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,510
and I would like to be able to customize the frequency of such emails.

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,489
Also, I don't see in YouTube who has submitted the captions, and there is no way to get in touch with the captioner.

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,268
I'd like to be able to write a direct message to discuss the captions.

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,519
There are some other feature requests on that page, and will be added to that page,

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,740
but the most challenging and at the same time the most valuable feature YouTube could have,

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,159
[RUSSIAN AUDIO IN BACKGROUND] is an opportunity to add a translation in the form of an extra soundtrack, like in a movie.

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,139
Voice translates voice; and the captions translate the slides, show the web links, clarify the code fragments, et cetera.

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,889
If voice translation is implemented then many of these other feature requests will not be that important,

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,899
And for the viewers, the viewing will become almost as comfortable as watching a movie.

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,510
If you are a YouTube developer or manager, then I'd like to make friends with you!

00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,268
I can provide more details and use-cases if needed.

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,610
That's about all I have to tell about the C++ Video Access Project.

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,889
Now I'd like to tell a bit about the history of this wiki.

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:20,039
During my volunteering at the C++Now conference in May 2017, certain occasion has triggered my idea of translating the C++ videos.

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,590
...to just one language...

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,690
...alone.

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,029
I started researching, and Jon Kalb showed me that YouTube supports captions.

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,750
He showed me the captions that he created for a promotional video.

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,189
For now, I believe Jon is the firstmost C++ video captioner.

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,630
I started experimenting with a short video, and got very unexpected and highly enthusiastic support from Jon.

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,159
He suggested to make the translation a global, community-driven initiative.

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,670
He told me about the sites reddit.com and wikidot.com that were considered as candidates for the wiki.

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,550
Even the name of the initiative --- C++ Video Access Project --- was suggested by Jon.

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,629
If not for Jon, then I believe my idea would have stayed just an idea.

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,230
Here's the takeaway of this talk. These [at the top] are live viewers.

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,399
These are English-speaking video viewers.

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,260
These are English-readers: those who understand written English, but not spoken.

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,430
And these are non-English-speakers: those who don't understand English.

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,230
The people in these two categories do not watch the C++ videos.

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
They get nothing from us.

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,580
There is a huge opportunity to broaden the audience of the C++ videos.

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,670
To reach these significant groups of people, we need to caption and translate our videos.

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,800
If you are a presenter, then you are the best captioner possible.

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,240
If you provide quality English captions, then your video will reach this group in one shot;

00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,019
and your captions will help the translators to cover this other group.

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,189
If you are multilingual, then you can help leverage the value of the tremendous work done at major C++ conferences.

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:13,539
You can become known among these people. By your next C++ onsite interview, the interviewers may start recognizing you by your first and last name!

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:22,029
If you are in one of these groups, then there is a resource that links you to the high-quality C++ content in your language.

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,938
YouTube provides support for us as a community to work together to do the captioning and translating.

00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:35,679
Everything you need is located on the C++ Video Access Project wiki, or can be easily added by anyone in the community.

00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,959
Go to cppvap.wikidot.com and start changing the world!

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,259
Thank you, and happy captioning and translating.

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
[ROBIN:] Questions?

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Yes...

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:38,580
I think there is a correlation between people who don't... English readers and non-English readers and ...

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,660
Languages or will be very unlikely that somebody

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,950
Not

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,810
understand English

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,230
So I think this that's it would

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,980
that make less sense to

00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,780
translate captions to German language or some other language...

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,580
Yes, I agree...

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,340
Can you turn on your microphone please?

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,600
Is it working now?

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:28,280
I agree that for such countries as Germany, Sweden and some other Western European countries' population, half of the population,

00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,300
most of the population speaks both languages.

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,120
But there are many countries such as China, Middle East countries

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,740
territory of former Soviet Union,

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Eastern Europe, Africa,

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,170
Latin America.

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,170
Many of them don't speak English.

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,840
If they are developers then they can read.

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,020
Maybe some of them don't even understand written English,

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:05,540
so there is still I believe a strong demand for videos in their native language.

00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,740
- Yes... - After you have some experience actually doing

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,960
the annotations on the video how long does it take?

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:29,880
The latest translation and captioning that I've done is John Kalb's lightning talk six minute video.

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,860
And it took me time from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:43,880
Captioning and translating to Russian. It's not difficult, but it's very time-consuming effort.

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,360
So that's why it's nearly impossible to do alone such an amount of work.

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,040
That's why this has been started as a community effort.

00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,640
- OK. - I was just trying to get a sense if I were to pick

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,840
an hour-long video and only translate it in English, that's the only language I know,

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,100
what's order of time sync in length?

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:19,340
If it's not the first-most your attempt, if you are already experienced in that, it would take I believe

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,100
one hour and a half video in English to caption in English

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,180
would probably take you 8 hours.

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,560
[Jason Turner] And that's starting where YouTube had already stub ... captions...

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,220
- You mean auto-generated captions?

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,940
- Yes. - Yes.

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,900
- OK.

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,700
You can do captioning for certain part of the video.

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,680
Another person if he wants to continue can continue...

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,110
... continue your work, and it might be collective effort. That's possible.

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:13,020
You just instead of submitting your captions save the draft and another person continues at that place.

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:21,080
You can provide captions for particular part of the talk where the audio was not recorded properly, for example.

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
Stuff like that.

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Even so

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,880
Which languages are having those

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,640
Yeah, the comment was as I understand

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,659
it probably makes sense to

00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,350
see which work is currently in progress and

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,180
That's quite possible, to add that page, and there is actually one page

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,360
which starts an initiative similar to that.

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:23,380
http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:in-process

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,680
So Jon Kalb created this page, and he was working on this video...

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
- Screen is off.

00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:01,460
http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:in-process On this page John has let others know that he is working on this video

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:08,340
and anybody else who has wikidot.com account can go to this page and edit this page,

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,000
add whatever you want,

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:21,080
save, and in such a way let other people know that you are working on some video.

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,080
Any more questions?

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,660
[Jason Turner] Do you think there will be value in me doing this for C++ Weekly also?

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,820
Yes, sure, I think

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,880
it makes sense to do captioning for those also. It will broaden the audience significantly.

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
And...

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,000
http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:ready-for-contribution-page Selection: "C++ Weekly by Jason Turner".

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,640
Community contributions are open on C++ Weekly.

00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,380
And I remember when this summer Jon Kalb was visitting his friend

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:28,300
in Sweden who was originally German, that person told that he saw all the videos by Alex Stepanov,

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,380
except only these 4 videos: http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:ready-for-contribution-page Section "Being Discussed".

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,680
And I tried to get in touch with the owner of those videos (YouTube user "assaissa").

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,100
Those videos are in Russian.

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,500
And I requested them to open the community contributions, but they're still

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,060
not responding to one of my notes.

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,640
So I requested them to open the community contribution, the person responded:

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,179
"I don't know who is the owner and I don't remember where I took those".

00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:11,440
I told him: "The owner is you and here's how to open them", - and still there's no reply.

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,300
So if this owner (assaissa) is watching now this video recorded, please open the community contributions

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,680
for this number of videos.

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,760
For these videos of Alex Stepanov. Please open those.

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,780
http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:wanted

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,640
Any more questions?

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,900
All right then! Let's proceed to the next session. Thank you very much!

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,280
