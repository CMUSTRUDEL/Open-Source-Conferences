The C++ videos can be viewed in multiple languages by an audience a few dozen times broader than today.
If you are a speaker and want your videos to be viewed by the whole world but not just by English-speakers then you can facilitate translation by providing original captions and translating to other languages you speak.
If you regularly analyse C++ videos in details, translate the fragments of it for yourself and would like to benefit the other people's translation then why not sharing the translation with the community? If you want your name to be recognizable you can write your name in the translation you submit.
If you are interested in C++ videos with captions/translations then there is a resource that gathers in one place the links to C++ videos in the language of your interest - http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:captions-catalog.
This talk tells how you can participate in this initiative and what you can get from it.
