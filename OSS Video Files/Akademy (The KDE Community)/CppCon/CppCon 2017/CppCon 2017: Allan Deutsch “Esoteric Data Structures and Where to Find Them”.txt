We already have array, vector, and unordered_map, what other data structures could we possibly need? 

As it turns out, there are a lot of them and they come from all areas of software! Curious to learn the latest method of representing a pathfinding search space in detailed 3D environments? Does efficiently detecting if a website could be malicious sound like an interesting problem to you? Perhaps understanding how AAA games store and track their entities so efficiently is more your speed? 

All these things and more can be yours in exchange for just one hour of your time! Using that hour we will delve into some of the unique challenges faced by C++ developers in a variety of domains, and learn the inner workings of the creative solutions devised to solve them.
