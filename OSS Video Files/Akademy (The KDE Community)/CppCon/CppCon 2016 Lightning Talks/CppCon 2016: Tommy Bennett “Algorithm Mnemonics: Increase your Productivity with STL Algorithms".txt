	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
ok when I was 12 years old my father

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,259
bought me an Atari 800 computer now

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,290
being a kid I wanted to learn how to do

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,170
was write video games right so now Torii

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,809
Hunter has a 6502 microprocessor so this

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,520
book was like my Bible for the next four

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,560
or five years I mean if you found me you

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,490
found this book hey I will be reading

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,039
this book at 3 o'clock in the morning

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,949
sometimes now I did going to publish a

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,830
video game actually in 1982 yeah I'm an

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,289
old programmer in a magazine called a

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,669
log competing and it's actually

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,950
available on YouTube believe it or not

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,079
now my world was these thrilled

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,760
three-letter mnemonics right I became so

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,710
immersed in this world that these things

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,870
came like tattoos on my brain they were

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,980
like brain tattoos you know what I

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,649
actually realized this was like

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,469
compressed information like Lda was all

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,820
this good character COC expanded all

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,090
these characters and it's like brain

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,460
tattoo vionex actually expands to 27

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,010
characters now I no longer programming

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,539
and seeming language but I wanted to you

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,879
know how could I take advantage of this

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,229
phenomenon of these brain tattoos and

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,409
that's when I came with the idea of

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,530
algorithm mnemonics what if the C and I

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,030
could expand to this or what I just

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,360
think F and I and all of a sudden this

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,310
all appears right what about RPI and it

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,500
all appears and it works for idioms too

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,600
like the erase remove idiom erm

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,250
experience y'all is and you're saying

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,110
well this feeling sounds cool time but

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,830
how would that actually work well let's

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,830
go to the video

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,780
okay now what I'm doing I'm typing the

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,210
container and then I typed in the money

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm feeling a container of negative 5 to

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,240
5 now I just type the container in the

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,460
money now I'm counting positive agency

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,759
like container nomadic it's actually

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,319
going faster you mean no okay and I was

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,380
yes do do you see XT oh that was gone

00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,179
for you and oh look and there's a random

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,960
advertisement for the control left

00:01:54,179 --> 00:02:03,840
bracket optimization I don't know how

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:08,819
they got in there okay again here comes

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,349
your container mnemonic and I feel if

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,569
I'm tabbing between those thing I'm

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,030
replacing all positive numbers with 42

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:19,290
of course and now I'm going to output

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,370
the game with Oh IT mnemonic and here

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,739
we're going to use the eraser remove

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,019
idiom I'm getting rid of that 42 and

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,450
notice it's faster to do the mnemonic

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:32,760
then actually cut and paste that out put

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:35,190
a rear area from above right so now if

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,049
you remember I told you about the 6502

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,329
strings yet well what I did I came up

00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,850
with the HDL instruction said I created

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:45,260
a mnemonic for every algorithm now if

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,260
you can you can do the same thing

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,290
and you'll be zipping through the

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,440
algorithms in no time you'll be like

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,870
your arsenal calling me will okay so how

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,810
do you get it you can go to my github

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,420
account and I got an XML file that has

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,640
every mnemonic and the suggested code

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,800
text that should be expanded now I did

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,650
implement it also for slick edit and

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,300
boom if you have those integers so but

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,510
anybody can take the XML and then

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,670
implement it for any editor oh wait

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,320
there's a bonus I will now tailor

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,030
ability to you the film secret well I

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,740
called the beam conspiracy now if you do

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,290
what I tell you dude you will increase

00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,450
your film performance by 10x now what

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,280
still most useless key on the keyboard

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,320
what's the caps lock key you want to

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,360
turn that thing off I suggest you go get

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,700
a crowbar and just pluck that thing out

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,050
this insolence no caps lock now if you

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,420
remember back in the day Sun

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,920
Microsystems they put the control key in

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,630
the right place that's where it's

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,380
supposed to be I mean that's the hot

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,540
zone man

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,220
now unfortunately Sun goes out of

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,470
business and it doesn't catch on right

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,570
so what's it can you do today you can

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,420
remap all operating system support yes

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,980
you can remap your control key to your

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,630
caps lock is also controller cap for

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,030
Windows now once you get this then you

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,700
hit paydirt you get control left bracket

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,980
no more escape and the control that back

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,170
you're like geez already building VM no

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,270
more escaping escape it's like it's like

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,910
we're in Seattle and Escape is over

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,530
there in Timbuktu no offensive here from

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,080
Timbuktu that's just a common expression

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,700
we use in United States okay now let's

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,270
go to the keyboard and do some analysis

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,790
now the home row is like the l1 cache

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,860
okay the next row is like the l2 cache

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,960
now the keyboard doesn't have a very

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,420
large processor so it's only got l1 and

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,040
l2 it didn't have a l3 cache now then

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,720
the next row is like the main memory and

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,370
guess what all those things up there

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,860
yeah you can see their peripheral

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,950
devices right so and what's the escape

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,410
key OSD date card every time you hear

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,850
nice cake looks like you're going to the

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,340
internet right and what do you what is

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,200
everybody doing VI a fat finger that

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,520
escaped it's like you're losing package

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,280
right and you're going in there and

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,840
pinging and try to retry and you're

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,070
trying to reset the network you know and

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,400
then what happens you get data

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,530
corruption in your editor

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,300
right when our where's the control key

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,940
man it's right there in hot zones I

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,410
don't catch right I mean and this is

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,180
like an embedded system because all

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,800
these keys they stay in there that you

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,889
get a hundred percent cache hit rate

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,770
okay now where is it where's the plate

00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,419
bracket oh I see the l2 cache right it's

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,669
the same thing you get a hundred Street

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,259
cache hit rate with both of those now I

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,289
know you guys are saying well Tommy's

00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,509
performing danger telling us where is

00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:27,169
your benchmark right where is the purse

00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:28,729
data well you know optimization that we

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,669
always say heard I was a place about

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,680
measurement is useless you know you

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,630
cannot get an optimization right well

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,030
unfortunately I didn't have time to do

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,130
any kind of analysis but I did be able

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,449
to come out like a unit test with you

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,760
know using the air the test harness and

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,560
basically what I can see if you see this

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,560
is the control left bracket optimization

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,039
okay now there's gate you can clearly

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,470
see that's got to be at least a 10x

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,220
booth right we're just in X lower it's

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,190
got to be

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,010
that's all IQ really offered so now I

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,539
highly suggest you try out the control I

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,389
mean this is a game changer it really is

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:10,160
an Atari it's free it's all I can be I

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,949
don't know how it got in there there's

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,659
no documentation about it I guess I

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,449
actually just happened to hit it one day

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:20,330
I said hey man this is great

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,909
I got tell other people about this you

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,979
know so now also if you try to be are in

00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:26,330
the past and you just couldn't you know

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,659
you got you couldn't stand that escape

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,789
stuff you should try VI again is I used

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:34,039
to be a vaccine user from time and other

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,780
editors and I finally switch the VI but

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,449
but when I discover just control that

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,340
bracket I mean that really I mean my

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,990
productivity went you know just through

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,000
the roof I mean I won't go back in here

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,639
again I'm like all day long and actually

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,990
I no longer noticed even I'm going a

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,500
different mode because really see you're

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,240
just going like this you know

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,040
with the control that bracket well

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,440
you're not doing you know playing whack

00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,130
them all day you know

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,810
it's just like that so thank you my

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,510
name's Tommy Bennett here's my economy

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,790
uh contact information so now go forth

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,420
and be nimble with ivory than the money

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,420
