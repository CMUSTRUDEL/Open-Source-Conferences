right good to go okay hi my name is

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,780
pepper

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,219
I'll presented Angela for the trends

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,519
today I want to talk about the elephant

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,760
do room which is actually I want to know

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,279
a little bit about my favorite IDE

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,550
it's called Q creator how many of you

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,769
know about QT creator that's the

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,359
elephant room right I haven't seen a

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,519
single talk about it haven't seen that

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,810
people talk about this stuff so for

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,790
those of you who don't know about kid

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,840
creator quickly there's a very nice idea

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,160
of course for C++ it's small it's a

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,739
hundred megabyte download you can

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,200
download right now it has multi support

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,510
it supports a variety of build systems Q

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,870
makes he makes all the pools other stuff

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,640
it has very nice refactoring debugging

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,850
profiling Beltane stuff it subversion to

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,239
can run the salon static analyzers on it

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,989
and so on if you want your fancy every

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,960
part of it is extensible via plugins and

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,369
it's open source and the main reason why

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,850
I use it is actually because it's damn

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,330
fast

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,720
it's lean Emil a does the job and gets a

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,900
result

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,150
and despite names but it's called cute

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,430
creator but it's actually used not just

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,490
for cute code many many people use it

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,580
for everything so I've got three minutes

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,590
for a demo for this thing I was thinking

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,100
about okay what can I show you in three

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,710
minutes

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,670
so I was trying to do a certain online

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,470
pad Zuul

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,700
actually sorry I was trying to explain a

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,140
friend of mine who does understand

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,479
shared pointers how SharePoint us work

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,790
yeah I bet you can't read any of that

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,979
can you because I'm this is about the

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,369
part around it can you know you can't

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,340
okay

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:56,850
matter right no surprise okay thank you

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,890
both and any any how what can I show

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,259
about this yeah this is a C make project

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,829
it has nothing to do with cute so okay

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,210
what kind of show very quickly this at

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,310
usual offers everything you can imagine

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,840
I can go over there and for sensory

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,140
factor data

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,420
only my data it just works I can save it

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,790
I can build it I can run it into the

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,220
bagger so it's there and whoa what's my

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,200
data oh it's actually a shirt pointer

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,810
yeah but this is much smarter than I

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,489
should be and actually shows me the

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,250
external time information I don't want

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:33,180
to see what you want ward the binos and

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,620
a lab nose lips tess STD cpp is

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,739
implementing this I just want to use the

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,420
use count Draft count and what's inside

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,130
data oh sorry I don't like that right I

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,650
want to see obviously all that so that's

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,660
pretty good what's going on below here I

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,360
creating a new data at leat data that's

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,130
the old way of doing things so actually

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,660
is not even crashing it just runs yeah

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,370
well let's ask our friend

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,040
mam check oh look I'm doing something

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,860
invalid so many many things but really

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,750
what's the single feature I use every

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,819
single day

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,160
well as I was saying this is fast this

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,370
Lena mean so let me show you I mean it

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,859
just opened something big work a lot of

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,350
aren't cute so what I just need I open

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:19,109
in a second a project which is about

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:22,859
three hundred thousand files it opened

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:25,890
up in seconds and yeah how do i navigate

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:26,430
this this mess many many files I don't

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,049
go around

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,120
well single feature I use every single

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,489
day is this small thing here in bottom

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,010
left corner it's called a locator you

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,810
trigger it by control K and once you

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,170
look but you trigger it you can easily

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,989
move around search for questions inside

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,549
your code base so yeah there is another

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,120
editor which is getting this thing yeah

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,959
yeah I know you see you've seen it so

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,510
how do I use this thing

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,100
well I trigger control K then I type one

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,810
of these letters or one of these strings

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,410
followed by space followed by the

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,239
arguments so for instance ah I don't

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,930
know I want to know about yeah

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,190
methods around what I got use data and

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,130
main yeah that makes sense

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,170
jump to main and go there I want to know

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,889
about a file in local projects of

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,130
reasons

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:17,489
yeah I want make sense oops that's an

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:21,780
include definition so I want to know

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:23,490
whoever wrote something like show yellow

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,639
thing or the great

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,180
name right yeah that's such a code will

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,199
exist

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,090
oh they all did that they blame oh yeah

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,310
somebody did that so I'm making names on

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,530
slides but so it's public history and so

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,289
you yeah I can be fit can navigate

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,319
around and in case I get in real trouble

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:47,520
I can always go as ask star core flow

00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:50,990
what is a very add the template tap that

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,120
and oh yeah meter is down okay

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,870
sorry you can see that all right sorry

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,130
working great

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,860
I've also got points on Stack Overflow

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,759
that's even yeah so okay well out of

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,979
time

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,590
give it a try its again it's open source

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,460
