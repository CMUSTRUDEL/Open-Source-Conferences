	00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,630
good afternoon I'm Stephan Sharon from

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,420
Susquehanna international group lllp and

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:21,650
I wanted to talk like everybody else has

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,900
this week about C++ 20 specifically what

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,410
made it in and some of the things that

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,800
maybe didn't there's some regular

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:35,290
disclosures for the cameras so simple as

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,399
plus 20 is big it's really big

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,300
mind-bogglingly big you wouldn't believe

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:45,890
how huge it is and probably even bigger

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:50,000
than C++ 11 was back in its day if we

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,590
look back before the last couple of sets

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,339
of committee meetings going into that

00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,829
there were a huge number of headliner

00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:00,980
items in fact more than I could fit on

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,899
one slide given that there's obviously a

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,150
great amount of interest in the

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:09,230
community so along with all the

00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:16,400
headliner items came a whole lot of new

00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:20,330
blog post syntax not only that there's

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,890
plenty more to come for example lots of

00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,500
lots of small items all of which are

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,580
incredibly important to a number of

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,510
constituents within the community yes

00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:39,410
such useful things as being able to

00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:44,200
actually essentially type def in an enum

00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,200
that always been missing for nine years

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:57,200
yeah take your pick

00:01:47,810 --> 00:02:00,800
no more volatile now so many items maybe

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,630
as a result of the the faster cycle

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,600
maybe it's the result of just the

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,269
interest in the language but both

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,870
attendance and the number of papers

00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:15,310
submitted to the committee has been

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:20,000
rising exponentially pretty much since

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,800
14 if not before the take a isn't quite

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,990
enough to tell whether it's

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,300
two linear lines intersecting or if it's

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:31,130
an exponential growth we'll know more in

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,290
C++ 23 but the important thing to note

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,730
is that the number of papers has grown

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,460
more than the number of attendees now as

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,950
anybody who's ever flown through the

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:46,640
Midwest of the US during thunderstorm

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:50,270
season knows there is only one possible

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:55,180
outcome of that scenario things get

00:02:50,270 --> 00:03:00,260
delayed and this is indeed what we find

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,390
so we have hurricanes is there but a lot

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,950
of the surrounding infrastructure for it

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:09,410
is still being worked on contracts

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:13,070
didn't have enough time to get finalized

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,250
so we'll get back some later point in

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:20,450
time in some way shape or form and

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:24,290
likewise amongst the smaller items much

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,760
to my own Chikara the implicit creation

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,459
of ovens for low-level object

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,160
manipulation didn't have enough time to

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,160
make it through so we'll go another

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,050
three years for that stood bless even

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,920
though that's really not a sufficient

00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,590
solution for the problem at hand but

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,989
yeah a few other places so we we got

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,989
source location so we know where we are

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:51,550
in the program we didn't get stuck tray

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,550
so we just don't know where we came from

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,680
then yeah in a number rows but it's a

00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,510
moving target keep an eye on CPP

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,510
reference and the compiler support page

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,280
that seems to be doing a remarkably good

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,670
job at keeping up-to-date with all the

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,120
various compilers and what they're doing

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,950
and finally yes I'm sponsored to be here

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,990
by my company and I have to say that

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:19,839
we're hiring thank you very much

00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,839
