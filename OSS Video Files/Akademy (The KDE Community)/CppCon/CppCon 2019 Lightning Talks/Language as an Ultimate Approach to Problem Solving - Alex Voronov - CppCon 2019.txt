hello my name is Alexander and today I'm

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,900
gonna give Wow

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,509
a small spoiler today I'm gonna give a

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,439
philosophical talk with a very meters

00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:27,029
ambitious title and first let me give a

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,310
small introduction the talk is going to

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,019
be based on this book which I read a few

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,760
years ago a book is unfortunately in

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,309
Russian Russian therefore I won't be

00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,960
able to share it with you and the book

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,220
is by kyoki she drove it's key it's

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,720
actually like a transcript of his

00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,739
lectures which he gave in

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,970
sometimes in 80s and the lectures are on

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,830
organization management about in his

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,049
book he's also talking a lot on the

00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,670
subject of problem solving and there are

00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,769
a few ideas which I picked up in the

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,110
book and I didn't find anywhere else

00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:57,030
during my career and these ideas were

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,549
very helpful in my career and therefore

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,080
I decided it is going to be more sharing

00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:04,290
so today I'm going to share my favorite

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,689
quote of the book and the quote goes the

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,640
essence of solving a problem is to find

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,310
a language in which the solution is

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,290
going to be obvious let's just think

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,780
about it a bit

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,860
the first part is kind of software

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,900
engineers we are working a lot in

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,910
different abstractions abstraction

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,190
levels in difference you can say

00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,410
languages in certain sense but what

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,910
really blew my mind is that I should be

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,890
aiming for this solution with my

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:33,330
language and shouldn't settle for

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,950
anything less than that and this has

00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,690
several implications which came to my

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,120
mind and I will try to share a few of

00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,350
those so the first one and what's

00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,600
actually encouraged to get me on stage

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,900
is last year Kate Rogers talks on

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,730
simplicity where she encourages to learn

00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,620
a young language better and all the

00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,930
tools available to you and I want extent

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,010
this list with not only items but design

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,180
patterns and then you can say

00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,100
architectural patterns or application

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,200
design patterns and so on and so on

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,039
those are all different languages you

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,110
can say and the more you know the better

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,720
chances you have to find an obvious

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,750
solution in one of them and if he comes

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,160
in the talk I really encourage you to go

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,680
there and also from this conference

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,550
there was a great talk by corner Hofstra

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,870
on algorithm intuition and

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,690
out of the stock I also took away a new

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,910
language in the general sense which made

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,620
a few things obvious for me and I

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,170
appreciate the talk and also command you

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:42,640
to catch up on it if you haven't seen it

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:45,260
on Monday changing the subject another

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,570
thing I realized from this shadow whisky

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,790
principle of searching for language with

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,280
an obvious solution is an answer to this

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,870
question and it feels like it should be

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,370
no you don't need university degree to

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,870
become a software engineer but still I

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,180
didn't know why and my idea that's what

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,460
university gave to me and to many other

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,310
people who I know who graduated from the

00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,720
unit's is like diverse set of tools they

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,430
were sort of dis languages which allow

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,380
you to start solving basic problems and

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,800
then go further and if you can acquire

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,780
this set of languages somewhere else you

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,430
don't need to go to university that's

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,440
like an interesting conclusion which I

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,280
got also from this principle and wanted

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,670
to share with you

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,980
and now concluding all this I want to

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,780
encourage you to do two things first

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,140
learn more languages and therefore

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,510
you'll have more solutions to your

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:39,680
problems by shadow whisky principle and

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,650
another important thing is to share the

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,690
languages among each other because

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,410
software engineering is collaborative

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,880
work in general and therefore first you

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,350
can help others to solve their problems

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,000
sometimes you need not to learn the

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,709
language so teach the language but to

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,330
invent a language in order to exchange

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,490
the ideas and therefore make your

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,650
solution obvious for somebody else and

00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,140
with all these together you will be able

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,780
to achieve more by working on the

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,280
languages you know and you use and yes

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,050
as a conclusion

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,750
don't settle for any in anything else

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,659
then an obvious solution thank you

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,659
