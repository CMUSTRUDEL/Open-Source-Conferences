In this talk, we will take the journey to compile-time.

We will start with adding templates to existing program, and overview overload resolution and conditioning at compile time.

We will continue with exploring the latest version of template metaprogramming updated by the release of C++20.

Finally, we will present techniques to control the compiled-time logic when instantiating templates, on C++20 and beyond.
