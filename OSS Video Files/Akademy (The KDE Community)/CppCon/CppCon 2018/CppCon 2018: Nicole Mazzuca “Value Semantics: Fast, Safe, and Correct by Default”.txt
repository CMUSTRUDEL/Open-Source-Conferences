We hear a lot about value semantics whenever there's discussion of C++, and value semantics are often credited as one of the "Big Ideas" of C++; but what does this phrase mean? And how can you use the principles of value semantics and regularity to make your code faster and more correct? 

We'll touch on using the existing value semantic standard library types, as well as creating your own types that follow these principles. You will learn useful optimization habits which create faster code without giving up the benefits of value semantics. I'll show you how to think in a value semantic way, so that your code is simple, fast, and correct!
