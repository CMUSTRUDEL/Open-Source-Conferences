Greg will demonstrate some neat new GDB features and other advanced debugging tools on Linux. 

Debugging dominates software development, and yet all too often we rely on printf or at best a little bit of gdb with a bit of 'next' and 'print'. This talk will demonstrate some of the power of newer versions of GDB (Reverse debug, dynamic printf, amazing scriptability possibilities through Python), as well as some of the other Linux debugging tools at your disposal: ftrace, strace, ltrace, valgrind, rr, asan, and lots of very useful stuff in /proc. 

This presentation works either as a stand-alone talk or as a follow on to Greg's popular 'GDB Power User' talk at cppcon 2016."
