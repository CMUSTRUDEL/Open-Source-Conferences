Your code would benefit from greater use of operators. Really. 

Operator overloading is such an unloved part of C++. It's not new, it's not 
glamorous, it's frequently maligned for "syntax abuse", and often avoided due to 
performance or implementation concerns. But operators deserve more 
consideration! If you're designing types and interfaces, operators have the 
potential to offer concision, clarity, and flexibility, and foster intuition in 
a way that functions can't. 

In this talk we'll look at past, current and likely future practices, from the 
humble old operator+ on arithmetic types to new uses like operator/ to 
concatenate paths, and beyond. We'll cover concrete guidelines for principled 
operator usage and the implementation concerns involved.
