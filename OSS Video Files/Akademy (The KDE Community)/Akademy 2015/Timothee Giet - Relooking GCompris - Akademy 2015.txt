Description: 
	A presentation about what's been done and what's left to do on GCompris new look.

This year I started working on new graphic design and illustrations for GCompris thanks to the partly-successful fundraiser for this project.
I want to give an overview of what's been done, explaining some of the choices that were made.
Also I will point at the remaining tasks for any interested contributor to help complete the look transition.
