Title: Aleix Pol Gonzalez - Going Cross Platform: Are We Compromising? - Akademy 2015

Description: 
	I would like to go through some of the issues I've found on some projects I've been working when it came to portability to other platforms and form factors, so we can put these problems in common, see them coming and come up with a general way to react to them.

Do KDE Frameworks dependencies help? Should I port the application to QML? What platforms can we take into account?

I'll try to infer answers from the discussions we've had for KDevelop, KDE Edu and KDE Connect.
