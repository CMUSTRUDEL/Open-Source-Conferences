Title: Andrew Lake & Thomas Pfeiffer - I Have Visions, Should I Go See a Doctor - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Come find out about how putting together a project vision, personas, scenarios and user stories can help to give the design and development of a product a clear direction.

"I feel like I could take over the world!" is a vision that one may expect to hear from a mad man - or tentacle - but sadly it is also how some organizations define the vision for their project or product. While this may spur one to work hard to fulfill the vision, it is hardly useful for guiding actual product design or development. Everyone ultimately wants to rule the world, don't they?

What we'd like to talk about are visions that _can_ serve as guidance. Visions from which one can derive a target persona representing the target audience, as well as user scenarios to define when, where, how and for what purpose the target persona should be able to use the product. From these, then, one can derive user stories for the product's specific features.
This set of guiding elements - vision, persona, scenario and story - help to give the design and development of a product a clear direction, and can assure that it contains all - and only - the features that are useful for the purpose it was made for.
The VDG has set out to define vision, persona(s), scenarios and user stories for all products we do major design work for. We will talk about how that has worked for us so far and how any project can benefit from defining them for their products.

	00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,360
oh yeah I think so all right to the next

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,210
time you saw I had a little trouble

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,580
reading it so really the target I was

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,369
thinking I have no vision I should

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,750
certainly go see doctor I know these two

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:41,180
gentlemen will be my doctors yeah let's

00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:53,239
get started thank you Stefan amazing

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:56,539
work so let's get event okay can you

00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,920
hear me ok um so yeah we're going to

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,920
talk a little bit about visions because

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,230
we didn't talk about enough force let's

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,789
spend a little more time on it um so uh

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,490
what talk a little bit about this on

00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:09,649
because obviously as you heard Thomas

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,020
mentioned earlier it's one of the things

00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:13,820
that drive us into visual design group

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,119
I've been learning a lot more about it

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,560
over the last year and a half there was

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,060
a time when I started when I just

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,380
started a visual design group where I

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,530
just wanted to put to get a pretty

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,600
pictures and Thomas and hike run a few

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,000
people have been encouraging me to not

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,100
just put together pretty pictures but on

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,540
have a purpose when you put those pretty

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,630
pictures together so I thought we

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,270
talking about that today all right so

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,610
there's a lot of a lot of ways to look

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,350
at vision probably lots of visions all

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,100
over the place a lot of them kind of

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,079
look like these very interesting I mean

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,180
they paid their they can motivate people

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,640
can be really really really interesting

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,110
to have a exciting sounding vision but

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,080
in a lot of cases they're not very

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,450
useful and this is

00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,820
several of them um and I kind of just

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,100
distilled in general what doesn't work

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,870
so well when you put together a vision

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm out give you some examples oh just

00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,040
so you know this kind of way

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,970
everything's okay just china yeah okay

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:23,470
so some examples from the real world I

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,470
like Dell computers so it's not anything

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,730
about though but it doesn't get any more

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:33,610
vague than that it really doesn't I mean

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,650
it tells you nothing about what it is

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,810
that they're trying to do yeah everybody

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,430
wants to be good everyone knows that I

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,620
don't think anyone goes out there sets

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,090
out to be the least successful computer

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,340
company so this is another I don't even

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:54,760
know who they are but I googled really

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:57,300
bad visions and got that and you can

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,560
probably find a host of others so um

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,130
let's talk about a little bit about what

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:08,050
makes a bad vision or a vision not a big

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:10,390
V vision so vague that's kind of what

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,470
we're talking about with a dell vision

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,630
lots of buzzwords synergy it goes with

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,510
it and actually have a mission statement

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,310
generator online that just basically

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,489
randomly puts together a bunch of

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,870
buzzwords with verbs and elaborate

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,340
mission statements and then you can go

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,140
look at some of the company lots of

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,120
companies mission big corporate missions

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,040
and they look pretty similar to other

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:40,030
mission statement generator produces I'm

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:42,910
so buzzwords um it's vague to pageland

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,269
provisions if you can't communicate your

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,269
vision in about five minutes it doesn't

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,310
work very well it's it takes that long

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,340
to digest whatever it is they

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,230
communicate it's not doing the job that

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,819
a bit of vision should do a vision

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,349
should be able to save someone whether

00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:01,209
it's somebody on the team works outside

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:02,560
of the team what it is that you're

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,569
trying to do what it is it you're

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,190
bringing that's unique and why why

00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,810
anyone either in the team should

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,390
participate or contribute or what

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,819
somebody outside the team should use

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,260
your product or use your whatever it is

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,359
that you're providing it is a service of

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,880
product confuses the what's in the house

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,330
this is going to fall off for long hair

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,840
so short again there we go confusing the

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,360
what's in the house I'm an engineer by

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,919
day systems engineering system safety

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,340
engineer by day and one of the things

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,410
that comes up quite a bit and in my line

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,450
of work is engineers always forgetting

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,130
what the difference is between what

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,250
you're trying to do and how you do it

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,000
and systems engineering we have this

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,320
thing where if you have a requirement a

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,580
high level requirement it should tell

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,770
you what to do it shouldn't tell you how

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,320
to do it figure out what you want to do

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,300
first and then once everybody's agreed

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,850
of what you want to do go figure out how

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,080
to do it so confusing what's in house

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,720
and then you can look at some missions

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,390
they've labeled describe their quality

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,490
system and you know the issue tracking

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,229
system and we have all but they don't

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,240
talk about why we have those things and

00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:19,090
really a vision should be describing the

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,979
what why is kind of sit just above the

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,200
what if you look in your general

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:27,160
hierarchy of requirements should slow

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,410
down and again vague there's a million

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,130
word survey Jan Erik Pickett but it's

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,240
all if it's vague if you sense vagueness

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,160
you might want to think about it a

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,160
little bit thoughts thumbs

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,010
okay so good vision the two are the ones

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,240
that most people focus on a baby needs

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,669
to have focus needs to give you

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:58,130
direction inspiration is the one that

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,720
people often interpret as vague if you

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,240
look at good vision statements they'll

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,130
still be the warm fuzzies in there so

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,930
when it when you from the previous slide

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,900
where I mentioned vague it's not a good

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,900
thing to have another vision you also

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,440
don't want a vision so Spartan you're so

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,880
devoid of meaning and and passion that

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,060
nobody cares what it is that you're

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,770
doing inspiration matters I'm so yeah

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,690
you can still have some of the warm

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,330
fuzzies in your vision but it does

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,039
matter to include you know get add the

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,020
warm fuzzies after you define the

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,199
specifics of the focus and direction and

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,710
add in glasses to all your visions in

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,220
the end for inspiration your vision can

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,380
ensure the bold it should be achievable

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,320
some nothing that is just completely out

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,810
of you reach but if you just mention a

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,510
vision that you can achieve too easily

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,639
than a bone exactly give inspiration

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,520
because people will just do what they're

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,490
already doing anyway and so it won't

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,590
help so in your vision you should set a

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:06,830
goal that is about what you already have

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:08,450
but of course still achievable point all

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,490
right so this is just an example there

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,560
million ways to come up with visions do

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,240
not take this as canonical this happens

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,680
to be one of the things that we in The

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Hague when you're trying to come up with

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,030
a concept for your project and come up

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,130
with a vision for your project it's just

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,590
an aid to walk through how elements that

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,210
are probably useful in coming

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,160
with the vision and this apply the more

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,860
specifically to an application or

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
product but you might substitute a few

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,760
things in and out if you're talking

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,920
about organizations or communities I

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,450
won't get into the specifics of that I'm

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:47,800
so but i would give you an example of a

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:51,070
really really good vision that i

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,200
couldn't i saw this on the on the untie

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,480
internets this morning and I couldn't

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,050
pass it up so I additive this morning

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,780
sorry Thomas a really good example of a

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,820
vision everybody's mentioned it before

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,650
so in doing a little bit of research for

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,810
the tiny little bit of research I did

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,240
for this presentation of a vast research

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,300
presentation it doesn't matter where I

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:18,130
go I keep coming back to this creature I

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,940
it is rare to find a vision statement

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:24,640
that is as clear as precise as

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,410
inspirational as this is and i'm not

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,540
talking about within free software i'm

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,560
talking about anywhere and it's not just

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,000
the words i remember when the creative

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,030
team came up with this and they

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,590
announced it and i was one of them what

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:48,400
i want to give for Katie what are you

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:50,800
doing but was really cool is I blew me

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,720
away every single time that I saw the

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,270
next step that they announced on the

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,460
planet

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,670
and you keep seeing them just rolling

00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,490
progressing each time and there's

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,550
there's a element Seattle and there's

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,690
there's one artist there he occasionally

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,760
shows about some of our local

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,190
conferences and he has Katie he has

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:15,770
creature up and I saw I met him last

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,960
November it was I think Valerie and I

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,510
saw him doing his stuff he's an artist

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,620
that's what he does he's not a developer

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:27,350
and to see him use this tool and produce

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,650
what he produces I it was I mean it

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,800
became crystal clear this vision wasn't

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:36,830
just a bunch of words it drove a product

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,050
that is unparalleled by every definition

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,510
I mean you talk to these guys and they

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,460
love it today it's amazing what a vision

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,790
can do when you use it one and let it

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,890
drive ship project plus as you can see

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,860
here that vision doesn't exclude

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,930
anything specifically it doesn't say we

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,740
do not do this and we do not want to

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,920
have that so theoretically if someone

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,630
wanted to do something that is not

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,300
particularly useful for digital tating

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,970
they could still do it and it probably

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,830
wouldn't be rejected but this is what

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,250
the team focuses on and this is what

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,980
they want to do right and do best and so

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,470
yes some people feel that all it might

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,030
exclude some ideas it doesn't have to it

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:27,800
still provides focus and it still

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:29,060
produces a great product so close an

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,810
example but here are some other things

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:37,500
that we see that visions

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,930
and before I go too deep into this it's

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,360
really important from the previous

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,640
slides that if you have a project that

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,170
you're working on it's not about just

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,510
coming up with a vision for a product

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,760
what was really important and in the

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,750
example that'll example tool it what are

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,430
you guys what do you think about

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,110
yourselves what is it that you're trying

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,240
to create a vision for it's not

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,980
obviously you can go through this

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,140
navel-gazing exercise of defining

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,970
yourself but try to understand what it

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,279
is that you're actually doing it it

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,750
matters in that from the previous

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,900
conversation I don't want editorialize

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,960
too much but if it's about community

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,390
then define what that is it matters to

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,730
have that navel gazing episode to define

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,020
what it is that you're trying to do to

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,490
the find your vision okay I'll go back

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,650
to the slide sorry editorial okay a

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,300
vision enables you to do stuff if you

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,600
create a vision that's not enabling you

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,150
to do stuff stop it's going to be pretty

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,700
words so we create a vision with a view

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,750
to enabling you to do specific things

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,860
visual design group kind of focusing

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,839
user interface design so we're going to

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,220
talk a little bit about those identify

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,560
applicable personas we'll talk about

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,290
what personas our target scenarios that

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,810
are that you want to develop to connect

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,230
your user to the goals that they're

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,730
trying to accomplish their user stories

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,810
make better new design decisions we all

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,220
want to make better your design

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,900
decisions one of the great things about

00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,760
having a vision and all the things that

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,410
flow down from that is it helps you

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,450
actually have a sense of a conversation

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,180
about how to design your user interface

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,950
and it for clarity there's a lot of

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,769
people that have really good easier to

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:14,279
face design skills it does not mean that

00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:17,129
doing this kind of intuitive connection

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,509
to the vision in the background so a lot

00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,769
of people are really good user interface

00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:21,269
designed it can be without something but

00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,639
a lot of times what's actually happening

00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,009
in the back the back of their brains is

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,379
this connection what is it that they're

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,299
trying to do with this project how can

00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,910
we connect what they're trying to do to

00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,439
the the user interface design other

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,889
general things that actually is really

00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:39,779
really helpful a project manager what's

00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:41,639
in scope and out of school this says yes

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,829
is some time is okay well somebody wants

00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:49,040
us to develop a sorting algorithm and

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:51,509
put it into que te let's say dolphin

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,910
maybe we don't need that in dolphin

00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:55,829
maybe that's not me you know there's

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,199
some things that just don't belong and

00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:00,509
having that focus actually helps to say

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,489
this doesn't belong in this specific I

00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,160
mean we've done media players there's

00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:06,809
tons of them do I necessarily want my

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,129
media player to be slideshows sometimes

00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,230
you do because that's what we want our

00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:11,699
product to do maybe we don't something

00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,439
just depends on what you're trying to do

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:15,749
in the prioritization this is what tom

00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:17,790
is talking about it's sometimes it's not

00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,529
about saying no sometimes it's about

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:26,639
okay we have limited resources where do

00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:29,160
we apply them I'll let you talk about

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,360
this one because I think this is great

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,459
but you came up with a slide yeah um a

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,249
tagline that there's one tagline which

00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,670
has become sort of famous by now within

00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:44,309
our community which is the the vdg

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:48,360
tagline simple by default powerful man

00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:53,069
needed so this is this is just it isn't

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:56,749
a vision because it yeah it doesn't

00:13:53,069 --> 00:14:00,319
contain the the necessary part in it

00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:04,069
well it isn't babe because you can

00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:06,029
everybody understands what it means and

00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:08,989
apparently it's catchy enough that

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:11,900
people remember it pretty quickly but I

00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:15,530
wouldn't say necessarily replace

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:17,600
vision because it's just too short for

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,690
that but it it complements vision quite

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,420
well because yeah in the one hand you

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,130
can of course use it for internal

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,170
communication because if you discuss

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,020
with someone maybe you don't want to

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:34,370
repeat the vision every time but if you

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:36,500
just mention your tagline and then often

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,290
you can already pretty quickly decide

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,050
whether your idea is in line with their

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,320
tagline and yeah of course it's also

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,140
really useful for outside communication

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,290
and for for marketing and promo so not

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,980
only we know about that tagline but a

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,100
lot of people outside as well and people

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,740
when when I put out that tagline in a

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,620
blog post I didn't only get positive

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:08,600
reactions some some people reacted

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,490
negatively to it but that was also in a

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,150
way a good thing because people who

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,120
don't agree with that tagline probably

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,710
won't agree without with what we do

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,200
anyway so there they can just see okay

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,900
is this something I want to use then

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:28,100
fine then I can look forward to what the

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,950
VG and ke in general will produce and if

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:35,620
I don't like that then maybe I should go

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:39,470
look elsewhere um yeah and another

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:43,490
example which wasn't officially agreed

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:47,450
but somehow came up is plasma get stuff

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:51,470
done so when when David practiced his

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:54,760
talk from yesterday um with me I saw I

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,980
thought hey David you just presented a

00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,830
tagline from plasma and you probably

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,290
weren't even aware of it and but still

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,720
it's something that probably most of the

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,680
plasma team already agreed upon and it

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,980
just hasn't been really formulated as

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,460
this is our tagline yet but yeah as you

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,960
can see this is really something that

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,880
can easily show people what plasma is

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,100
about and as such it's awesome yep

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,470
I don't have a whole lot time yet that's

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,540
it's a great communication tool it's

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,890
almost like a mental link to your vision

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:35,650
it's a quick way to say hey this is in

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:39,390
line or out of line with our vision so

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:42,520
yeah tagline say are great I'm not you

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,260
so um I'm not gonna say a whole lot on

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,730
this because this is Thomas's domain but

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:51,730
what 1 i'm sorry material know one of

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,230
the things that I'm I found I'd learned

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,900
over the last year and a half that

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,050
visions allow you to do is it really

00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,490
provides the boundaries of scope for

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,770
developing these kind of essential

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:09,280
things done that that's helpful for user

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:11,980
interface design I'll go ahead yeah well

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,339
many of you probably have already heard

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,170
of the concept some of you maybe not so

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,939
yeah persona is a fictional character

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,860
created to represent the different user

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:27,670
types that met use a product in a

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,340
similar way so um ideally and in the in

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,370
the original concept personas were meant

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,860
to be based on actual user research and

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:39,670
do the data and this is still the best

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,890
way to do them because yeah if you don't

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:47,860
have data then it's still sort of

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:50,740
guesswork but in most cases even guess

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,920
work based personas are still better

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,940
than having nothing at all because even

00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,310
if the the perception of the team that

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,550
the team has about the users doesn't

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:06,370
exactly match the the actual users then

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,350
even then you still have can make sure

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,740
that everyone is talking about the same

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:14,230
thing because if you don't express what

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,450
you think or how you think it uses are

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,070
then everybody in the team has their own

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:24,550
their own representation and their own

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:28,360
thoughts about the users and different

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,910
people will have different focus and

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,420
sometimes they may even argue about

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,530
something and each team member thinks

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,040
he's right or she

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,530
because they they have their own user

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,480
group in mind and once you have made

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:49,930
this explicit and said ok we agree that

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:53,350
we think or know ideally know how I use

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:55,510
this art then yeah you can you can have

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,420
common ground to this to base your

00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,740
discussions on you can also use them to

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,470
target who you're trying to actually

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,670
build your project for sometimes you

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,930
might want to try to build it for

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:12,340
everyone you can't pick someone or two

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,410
or three exactly so yeah that's that's

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,750
awesome problem even if you have several

00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:19,390
user target user groups and therefore

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,490
several personas you should still or you

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,530
have to still have a primary persona and

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,590
say okay this has to work really well

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,820
for this persona we can add features for

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:34,270
the other personas as long as they don't

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:40,140
hamper the experience of the primary

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:43,120
persona then yeah scenarios are a

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,890
description of what a persona using a

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,720
product or yeah scenario where a persona

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:54,730
uses a product to achieve a certain goal

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:58,870
so this is on a higher level then use

00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:01,210
the stories so for example I know one

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:06,550
scenario for media player might for

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:08,740
example be a party so the persona yeah

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,520
might be someone who has a lot of

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,970
friends and wants to impress them with

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,070
their cool technology they're using and

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,900
yeah they're they're at a party and for

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:25,240
example at the party everyone is allowed

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:27,880
to to choose the music yeah so that that

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,190
isn't yet use a story but it describes

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,230
in general what is happening in this

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,580
situation and it has important

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:38,620
implications on the actual user stories

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:44,260
yeah and then the user story is the the

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:47,170
lower level where for example persona

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,400
representing a guest at the party once

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:55,690
to change the track to something else

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,490
from within the media library and yeah

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,000
so there are of course several of those

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:04,210
user stories within the scenario and the

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:12,850
user stories are then the thing which is

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:14,770
translated into actual features and so

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,110
like we like we've mentioned several

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,780
times before they provide the basics for

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:23,650
building great user interfaces and as we

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,270
mentioned a ride from a good vision not

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,150
a terrible vision you can't get anything

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:32,200
from the television um so I'm about to

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,150
go through some an example this is stuff

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,220
that Thomas and I kind of worked through

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,590
I don't even think I have all of your

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,140
comments captured in it and this is not

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,730
meant to be hey and plasma team go do

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:50,980
this that's not what this is meant to be

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:53,470
so plasma team it's ok ok so this has

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,550
been I confess this is this is something

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,270
Thomas been thinking about for a while

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,890
not kind of glommed onto and on it was a

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,210
desktop configuration for plasma and you

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,770
know Thomas has had some thoughts about

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,070
this for a while you can either Sam the

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,020
plasma team now I'm just kidding but so

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,180
we're thinking about this and on so what

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,550
we wanted to do was well what if we went

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:16,450
through this exercise and this was like

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:19,870
last year and no vision here has been

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,880
approved by the platter pee let's get

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,820
that out of the way this was how can we

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,080
what what will be used to guide for

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,390
example what is the design of

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,000
desktop configuration if we were to

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,799
propose a new design and we can talk

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,149
offline about this plasma team whether

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,059
or not this is something to make sense

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:40,039
settle down okay um so we cannot make

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,240
cable in this vision or I came up with

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:46,549
this vision and Thomas didn't object

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,409
strenuously to it so time that the list

00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:50,149
out provides an easy-to-use workspace

00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,010
effortless that you can read thank you

00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:56,330
for you so this is this is what we use

00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:03,260
to kind of guide the next few steps in

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:06,019
on the design we kk t has some

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,779
prepackaged personas that you can use if

00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:11,179
you're doing your own work so you can go

00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:12,230
I think they're linked in The Hague yeah

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:14,779
in fact I know they're linked in The

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,610
Hague so if you go to the egg and you're

00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,440
trying to find personas for your project

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,820
I'm there's some prepackaged ones and

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,760
what I found is that in most instances

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,880
they cover most of the needs that you

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,500
need for design so you'll see these

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,269
names here they're actually names from

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,230
the the personas they were created back

00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:35,029
in katy for by the way what are we

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:39,409
calling these days is it okay whatever

00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:43,190
so Susan Phillip and Santiago their

00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:45,110
personas for from the from the standard

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,970
prepackaged be so listen when you read

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:52,250
their stories you when you read who they

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:54,110
are it'll make sense why we use them so

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,970
we came up with several scenarios I

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,090
think they're probably about seven eight

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,770
nine ten scenarios I forget

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,350
this is an example of one of them is so

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,820
it's really worried but the point is to

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,049
hey sit down and think about what it is

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,510
that you people are gonna be using your

00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:10,279
thing your widget your product whatever

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,830
it is and come up with these scenarios

00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,260
and it kind of helps with the design as

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,150
it turns out the next few slides will

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,809
not be about this scenario but i just

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,909
want to show you what a scenario okay so

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:24,350
screenshots are coming up another mock

00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:27,620
ups are coming up these are not

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:31,130
screenshots and some mock-ups yet don't

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:34,399
freak out okay so the screen the the

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,350
mock-ups are really about well what if

00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,510
we kind of tried to refine our panel

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,850
configuration so oh by the way this has

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:44,240
been out on the community khadija org

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:46,880
wiki for like the last ever me like it's

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,649
been up with for months I'm so this

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,100
isn't new stuff it has been up there for

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:54,070
a while um so you can't see anything on

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,510
this wonderful higher resolution screen

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,909
but the idea we're going to walk through

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,909
what this design essentially does for

00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,620
just the panel configuration okay so

00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:08,360
pretend that you put the button here and

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:10,630
that's the selection or menu and you

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,830
selected hey I want to edit my panel on

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:18,919
kid Lord this is terrible so that's kind

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,630
of a dialogue II thing you can read the

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,179
thing below it that you can guess what

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,159
what do you think so there's a little

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,750
black bar above abyss and grab handles

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,789
on there on the hover hover over the

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,620
mouse over over the on the panel applets

00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:34,880
are pretty much the same but you get a

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,860
little bit something a little bit easier

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,330
to maybe look at and reading understand

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:43,279
in terms of what the panel configuration

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,990
options are it would follow the mouse so

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,279
if you hover over the top panel if you

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,559
have multiple panels then that that

00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:53,710
dialogue would follow on the panel that

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:58,880
you're hovering on um short very well so

00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:00,230
the handles for the the min max size for

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,090
the panel's this is what this is

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,679
supposed to show with the anchor just a

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,570
different visualization for allowing you

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,370
to to change the panel with this is what

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:14,179
it looks like when you have your men

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,860
panel set the next panel set there's a

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,250
lot more on the community that Katie

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,750
wiki the point is you can use using

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,270
those scenarios kind of helps you narrow

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,159
down especially for the Edit panel edit

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,600
panel dialogue what do you think they

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,190
want to use in there you kind of refer

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,419
to you soon are your user stories to

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,159
kind of figure out what are they doing

00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,590
in this state what they what don't they

00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,789
want to be doing in this state what are

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,460
things you can recede into the

00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,470
background or remove from availability

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,970
when they're in the state of

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,350
configuration that's really kind of one

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:48,770
of the things that we're focusing on is

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:55,690
pull stuff away from the user and she do

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:55,690
anything else so finally in summary

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,919
visions drive projects they drive

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,950
organizations if I Drive communities and

00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:07,600
it really makes it easy to do user

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,600
interface design consistently

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:27,710
we have a question let's share that Mike

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:32,540
and I can oh yeah that that that I think

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:37,630
I get that so yeah we have box so don't

00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,630
them ask these questions at the box okay

00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:03,230
I certainly go to the research no I for

00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,970
the places that I've seen it work well

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,820
and I don't have the words off the top

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,990
of my head but it's it's it's a little

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,860
bit what I alluded to in the navel

00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:14,930
gazing piece and knowing what you are

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:17,420
sometimes organizations to find

00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,640
themselves on the product I so I just

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,650
started a new job at Blue Origin if you

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,740
guys are familiar with Blue Origin they

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:27,350
are they build rockets which is fun but

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,960
on it one of the days are welcome letter

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,150
and in that welcome letter they talk

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,410
about what the company's vision is and

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,680
one of the things that they mentioned in

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,510
there is an example is we don't just we

00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,150
don't just build a space before we're

00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:44,000
building a company that builds spaces

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:47,000
that focuses a lot of what happens in

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,760
that organization because it's not just

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,560
about focusing on the one product it's

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,300
about organization focusing on what you

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,880
want to do in it when you're making

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,460
those decisions day today so for me that

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,110
you're talking about community is a

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,809
community really about the product or as

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,399
a community

00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:04,289
Portillo community that builds products

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,659
for example I think there are a lot of

00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:09,149
ways you can look at that design that

00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,529
vision I think it's just doing a little

00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:13,529
bit of navel gazing try to figure out

00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:17,789
what it is everything all for example

00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:21,059
the Mozilla are not the call it mission

00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:23,399
or vision or whatever it's also it's not

00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,179
perfect but it's also a nice example to

00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:30,440
draw from all right thank you in person

00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,440
we really

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,400
