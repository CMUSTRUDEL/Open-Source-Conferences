Title: Kevin Ottens & Franck Arrecot - Test Doubles: Unleash the Doppelgängers - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02

Description: 
	Last year, we covered a wide range of Craftsmanship techniques touching architecture, code structure, project management... one of the recurring theme was testing. None of those topics could be covered in depth as we focused on
the big picture, but this year we're back and we will dive deeper in this test thing. In particular we will look at what every craftsman should have in his toolbox: test doubles.

Hopefully, most of you are now convinced that testing can be a good thing... but it can also make your life miserable if you don't have a proper design. To get to this superior level of internal design, you need the proper tools to prepare the scaffolding of your application while applying TDD. Those tools are falling under the broad name of test doubles.

We'll first cover the different type of test doubles: stubs, mocks, spies, fakes and dummies. It is especially important to settle on a common vocabulary as the frontiers between those can be fuzzy. Then, we'll present the different contexts in which you can use them. In particular we'll try to highlight a potential strategy to pick the right type of double depending on the work you're doing on your software and it's level of maturity. In order to present this strategy, we'll try to focus on a small code example and make it grow showing how the design is supported by our doubles and tests.

Of course, we won't conclude this talk before we also covered what a doppelgänger is.
