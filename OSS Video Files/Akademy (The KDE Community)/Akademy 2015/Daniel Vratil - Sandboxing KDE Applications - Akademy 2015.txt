Title: Daniel Vratil - Sandboxing KDE Applications - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	In this talk I will explain what sandboxing applications actually means, what is a sandbox runtime, how running KDE applications in sandbox benefits users and 3rd party application developers and what changes in KDE and Qt are needed to make it all work.

Sandboxing has two major advantages: it provides a standardized pre-defined runtime environment that applications will run in, and it provides additional security in terms of full control over which hardware (or software) resources each application can use.

This talk is targeted at both distribution and application developers.
