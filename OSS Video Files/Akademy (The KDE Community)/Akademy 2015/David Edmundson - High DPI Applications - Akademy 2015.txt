Title: David Edmundson - High DPI Applications - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Want to make sure your application is usable on high DPI screens? This talk explains how to make sure your code is compliant.

In this talk I will give a rough overview of the concept of device independent pixels, which allows us to run applications on high DPI displays with minimal changes.

I will present some code examples of how to prepare your QWidget or QtQuick application to run on a high DPI display; how to provide larger pixmaps and going over some of the common pitfalls in existing codebases.

Finally I will demonstrate how to test your application without having to buy new hardware.
