Title: Keynote: Matthias Kirschner - An Endangered Species: Computer as a Universal Machine - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Computers are universal machines, which you can program to do whatever
you want. Meanwhile several IT companies do not like this. They want
to arbitrarily limit what we as a society can do with those machines.
They use technical measures to take away rights from us, which we usually receive when we buy a product. The industry wants to decide what we can do with computers, and what we are not allowed to do. Do we want to give them this power? If not, what can we do?
