Title: Keynote: Matthias Kirschner - An Endangered Species: Computer as a Universal Machine - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Computers are universal machines, which you can program to do whatever
you want. Meanwhile several IT companies do not like this. They want
to arbitrarily limit what we as a society can do with those machines.
They use technical measures to take away rights from us, which we usually receive when we buy a product. The industry wants to decide what we can do with computers, and what we are not allowed to do. Do we want to give them this power? If not, what can we do?

	00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,820
first of all thanks very much for the

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:25,090
invitation and the opportunity to speak

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:27,490
here here in my hands I have more

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:32,080
computing power than the whole world

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,000
head and we landed on the moon I have

00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,309
more computing power than all computers

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,030
together in the world and we landed on

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:44,440
the moon and this is an extremely

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:47,739
powerful machine today those computers

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,340
are not just in space shuttles or the

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:54,460
base station or you don't need large

00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,620
buildings to have a computer in there we

00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,629
have to everywhere we have them in our

00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:05,100
homes as a TV as Wi-Fi router we have

00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:09,759
plenty of them in our cars in our plates

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:13,300
we carry them around in our pocket or

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,580
have them on our laps and some of us

00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,520
even have them inside their bodies for

00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,780
example as a hearing aid or directly

00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,149
connected to the heart as a

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:28,840
defibrillator so you can do all those

00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:30,399
things with one single machine one

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,990
single machine which does all those

00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:36,369
things because it's a general-purpose

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:39,690
machine and this machine we will be able

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:43,270
to solve so many problems in the future

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:47,259
because it's not limited we can do

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,750
everything with it so there are so many

00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,569
possibilities which we have with this

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,119
machine so many things we can do so many

00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,729
problems humankind can solve with those

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,069
machines and even if together we all

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:02,470
together sit here and brainstorm about

00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,020
crazy ideas what we can do with that it

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,840
will just be a fraction of that what

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,580
would be possible when we landed on moon

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,350
people would not have imagined what we

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,570
would do today with those compute

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,630
the question is how long will that be

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,180
true how long will it be the case that

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,300
all of us can decide on our own what to

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,240
do with those computers might someone

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,650
else limit us in there in what we can do

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,440
with these machines who will or might

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,910
limit us in what we are able to do with

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,510
this powerful machines who will control

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,820
the computers around us who will control

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:53,830
the computers which might be a danger

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:58,030
flaws so today i want to show you how

00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,130
companies slice by slice took away

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,610
functionality from this machine which in

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,760
principle to do everything how they

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,739
discovered that if they reduce the

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,760
functionality of the machine that they

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:14,950
might have a financial benefit for that

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,810
so first i want to give you some

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,269
examples of what already happened and

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,360
then i want to share some ideas with you

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:24,160
what we can do to counter this and i'm

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,290
also looking forward to discuss those

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,470
ideas and your ideas during the

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,450
conference with you also after the talk

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,340
so please if you have something ideas

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:39,130
come up top with me i'm here for the

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:41,799
next two days so the first thing first

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:47,049
cut is general purpose machine head is

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:50,049
quite obvious for you companies made

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,459
software proprietary before you could do

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,500
everything with the software you could

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,610
use it for any purpose study the source

00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:01,650
code share it with others and improve it

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:04,900
but then they decided to cut those down

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,769
so they decided who is allowed to use

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,400
the software they decided to limit what

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:15,250
you are allowed to do with that software

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,049
they decided to limit who is able to

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,290
learn what all these powerful machines

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,470
around us are

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,390
doing how they are functioning they made

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,370
it very hard for us to understand how

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:29,300
those machines work because they didn't

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,280
provide a source code and they also made

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,230
it difficult for us to share the

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,110
software with others so if we solve the

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,930
problem or if a problem once or solved

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,940
by Union kind they didn't allow us to

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,540
share this with others so that their

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,300
problems are also solved and they made

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,630
it very difficult for us to adopt the

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,260
software to our own needs so they

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,670
limited what we can do with that they

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,620
didn't allow us to just make one small

00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,470
modification through the software so it

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,420
does it the way we wanted they force us

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,250
to write a software from scratch or to

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,930
change our behavior so it fits the

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:11,660
software so all of that was cutting down

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,640
what we can do with these machines there

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,070
are lots of limitations what we have

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,990
imagine if all software out there would

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,310
be free software how fast we could solve

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,260
problems but in this case it's slowing

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:30,950
us down the machine is not as powerful

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:32,720
as it could be for humankind the many

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:37,970
other of those restrictions which this

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,010
machine with God from from others was is

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,580
often the summarized under the term

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:48,050
digital restrictions management so

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:50,720
companies invest time to make to develop

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,810
functionality which all the users don't

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,680
want most of to use a stone bond they

00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,350
invest time to make the Machine worse

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,810
than it was before to save their

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:08,030
business model so one of the wide widest

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,800
known examples is the sim card block

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,600
with mobile phones everybody on the

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,600
streets knows about that so companies

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,090
invested time to write a program which

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,080
checks what sim cards you are putting

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:26,210
into your mobile phone and if this sim

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,900
card which perfectly fits in there and

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,509
the

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,270
good deal with every sim card from all

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:35,030
providers they check whom it belongs to

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:39,830
the sim card and just allowed it if it's

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:42,229
from one provider so that was not a

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,520
functionality which people laughed that

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:48,470
much especially when you're on vacation

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,350
and if you have the same products as the

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,030
same phone with or without sim lock you

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,530
would always choose the one without

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:59,960
similar if it's for the same price but

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,880
they invested time to through air

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,550
functionality which most people don't

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,229
want and also there by limited what the

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,020
computer else hasn't won because we kind

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,520
of just say don't allow other sim cards

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,199
but you have to add a lot of other

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:18,520
restrictions through this computer as

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:21,830
well most of you probably don't notice

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,099
notice because you might use software

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,889
which ignores it but when people watch

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,770
DVDs they often have two sons capable

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,860
breaks one or several of them and though

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,669
son skippable tracks they tell them that

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,770
they are not allowed to copy the DVD and

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:43,490
they tell them what will happen when you

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:46,460
do so and you cannot say yes I heard

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,639
that I already saw this notice for 10

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,289
times 100 times please fast forward

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,070
that's not possible you have to watch it

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,930
every time now the thing is what would

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,620
have happened if people wouldn't have

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,120
seen those notices what could be the

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,760
worst thing that happened if people

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,199
who'd not see this they might not know

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,409
that they are not allowed to copy the

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,250
DVD they might not know what the

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:15,460
punishment is oh and is defined as

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,750
$250,000 they might have noticed and

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,490
maybe some companies wouldn't have

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:24,889
earned so much money also that's

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:29,030
questionable how would that be

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:33,260
transferred for other devices how would

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,910
something like this look for a car when

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,330
I had fries with my car

00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:43,410
and I don't know the rules I can do much

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,030
more harm I can actually kill people so

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,460
how would something like this look for

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,930
car do I have to sit there every time

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:55,530
and then the Machine tells me you have

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,200
to drive on the right side you should

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,930
not drive as fast in the city as you try

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,640
from the highway when there is a red

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,000
light it doesn't mean drive as fast as

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,520
you can but stop and and then they will

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,910
tell me all the these sentences for the

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,620
different things which you could do and

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:20,640
that every time before i drive to

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:22,500
supermarket would that make sense so you

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,020
have to do it every time and you

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:30,390
couldn't say okay I know it the the

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,000
other thing they also did with DVDs was

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,530
that the company's divided the world

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,270
into five areas and see DVDs got a

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,400
region code and the players for the

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,260
region code and then you could just play

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,290
the dvds in with the player from the

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,910
region code we bought us it at a DVD so

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,580
when you were on vacation we bought a

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:59,040
DVD you couldn't watch it there but yeah

00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:01,350
suddenly with music CDs there are also

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,610
lots of restrictions but they introduced

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,940
an detect all machines so one thing

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,790
which this general purpose computer can

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,630
do very good is copying when you have

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:20,580
one audio file with one command you can

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:23,640
have 10 100 1000 or million without much

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,890
costume it's very very easy and with the

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,280
internet you can make these copies from

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,440
one place around the world to another

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,610
now you would think that the music

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,430
industry was very happy event

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,440
us wide distribution of computers and

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,660
Davis was cheap internet connection

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,370
let's all bow we don't have to press the

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,320
CDs anymore and distribute them to our

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,990
shops we can directly send it to the

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,300
people home but that's not what they

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,529
thought at that time they thought how

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:57,620
can we make the computer how can we make

00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:00,470
sure that our music files cannot be

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:05,260
copied how can we remove a functionality

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:09,589
which this computer is so good at so

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:12,110
what they did was they developed a copy

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,880
protection or the cities and editors to

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:20,149
the city's problem was that they also

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,850
implemented in a bad way so when people

00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,920
bought one of those cds with all CD

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,579
players you often couldn't listen to the

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:33,470
music CD wasn't working also for car CD

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:37,910
players and so when you bought a CD it

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,709
was better than if you would go to if

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:44,149
you would download music files and

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:47,810
burden on your CD yourself not really a

00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:50,269
popular thing and one big advantage at

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,970
that time was that the companies they

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,560
had to put a label on those cities there

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,449
to put a label that it's one of those

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,339
cds which is restricting what you can do

00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:04,040
with them so you can decide not to buy

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:05,779
one of those cds next time and some

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,060
companies didn't stop there when it

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:14,360
didn't turn out as they expected imagine

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:17,959
you buy a CD you go home put it inside

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,699
your computer and then there's a program

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,680
installed without your knowledge and

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:24,860
this program checks if there are

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,560
programs executed which could copy the

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,560
CD and if it detects one it kills it and

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:37,660
beside that it also opens some security

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:44,600
holes and slows down your computer

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:47,170
doesn't seem that interesting but it's

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,889
what happened when you gave 20 euros

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:55,029
to Sonia for buying one of those cds

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:58,209
they had at 450 million CDs and it

00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:01,180
didn't just stopped to attack the

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:04,360
computers of individuals in the end to

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,970
100,000 computers of governmental and

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,000
military institutions were affected by

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,070
that so they attacked all the machines

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,639
and remove functionality from those

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,050
machines just to preserve their business

00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:25,959
model and to make sure that you cannot

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:27,459
copy a CD now I'll ask the question

00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,430
because you all have to wait a little

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:36,579
bit who of you ever lend a book to

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:41,399
someone else nice and who of you already

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:41,399
sent an email attachment to someone else

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:48,160
it's not that difficult writing so I was

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:52,199
a little bit puzzled when I first read

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:57,699
that you can lend books with Amazon

00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:59,769
ebooks I thought well it's a file you

00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,600
can copy it it was already possible with

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:05,199
other books it's so easy to send around

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,529
files why is that not possible it's not

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,560
possible because Amazon and others made

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:13,449
sure that on those eBook readers they

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,690
control this platform and take away

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:18,850
functionality from us they control those

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,350
and make sure that not you are allowed

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,269
to decide what you can do with this

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,490
computer but they decide what you are

00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:27,040
allowed to do with this computer so they

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,290
decide that you are not allowed to lend

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,819
a book and just keep it on your reader

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,500
and when you want to lend a book you

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:35,920
have to lend all your books your whole

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,959
bookshelf and then after some time they

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,810
developed a functionality to do it but

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:46,149
that was all because they first

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:49,569
introduced those restrictions so from

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,430
those things that you were at that

00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:53,620
people companies were attacking our

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,680
computers like with the sony rootkit or

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,960
that they edit restrictions to

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,020
other devices outside like the cities'

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,850
with the e-book readers you go deeper

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,290
you control the whole computer and make

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,810
sure that you cannot install another

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:15,149
program there to circumvent this who

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:19,860
have you heard about we feel secure boot

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:30,399
okay and trusted platform module TPM

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:39,190
okay so it would the theory the theory

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:43,810
is that different the theory is that you

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:46,660
have a chain of trust that you decide in

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,010
the beginning what operating through all

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,980
hardware will boot so it works that

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:57,010
there are keys in the hardware and then

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,899
you you check what those operating

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,250
system if it has to write signature with

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,730
this key and if it has to write

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:07,209
signature it will start so you can make

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,390
sure that I trust the key of my

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,400
distributor and then it will boot the

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,740
operating system and if it was

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,600
manipulated and thereby the signature

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,570
will be change it will not boot so i

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,450
will be i would be protected against

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,480
attackers at this level already and then

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,790
this operating system will start and can

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,680
also check which applications should be

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,480
on this machine which applications are

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,520
allowed to be installed and what what

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,680
permissions they have so i could for

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,660
example i would be warned if Sony tries

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,380
to install a rootkit on my machine it

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,570
will not allow this probably and I could

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,760
also make sure to give programs to write

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,730
permissions to do something with my data

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,980
or not do it for example I could decide

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,120
to give Amazon to write download e-books

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,089
and I could

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,850
give Amazon's program the right to read

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,940
those files in my machine so i can read

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:09,189
them on computer but i might not give

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:11,309
them the right to delete those and out a

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:16,809
that's actually one thing i forgot to

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:18,720
talk about at the book part that they

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:24,120
didn't just invent this but they also

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,120
removed books later from you so they

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,809
they afterwards when you already bought

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,960
a book they deleted those books from all

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,300
the machines happened for example with a

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,070
charge always 90-84 they removed the

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,980
books from all the readers of the people

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,679
without anyone knowing it or you

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,960
couldn't do anything against it so yeah

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,420
you can protect against such threats and

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,809
you can make sure that your data is

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:55,300
protected well that's especially

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:58,780
important if the owner of a computer and

00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,270
the user are different people so when

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:05,020
you have to program the software of one

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,700
of those atms the bank probably doesn't

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,100
want that the user is allowed to install

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,110
other programs on this machines they

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,950
probably don't want that you are allowed

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,570
to modify data on this machine without

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:20,110
they knowing it they want to make sure

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,030
that just trusted people can make

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,040
modifications to this machines and that

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,170
you are just allowed to go there type in

00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,450
your PIN choose an amount get the money

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,270
without installing programs changing the

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,940
the computers behavior because this

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:38,260
machine is all by banging out by you but

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:43,840
you are the use of this so the problem

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:47,140
is that the same the same mechanisms

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,650
which help to protect the owner of a

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:55,240
computer which help to protect you from

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:58,840
from attackers can also be used against

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,970
you as the owner it can be used against

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,600
the owner of the computer you just have

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,640
to make one small change you have to

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,030
make one small change and that's that at

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,260
the beginning you are not allowed to

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,030
decide whom to trust and the first step

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,300
you are not the person who is allowed to

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:22,240
say I trust this key and I don't trust

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,070
that key and at that point and you are

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,170
not allowed to do this the whole thing

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,990
will change and then someone else

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,740
decides which operating systems will be

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,790
running on this machine and which not

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,440
someone else will decide what

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,000
applications you are allowed to install

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,130
on this computer and which you're not

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,660
allowed to install and someone else will

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,210
decide what will happen with your data

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,130
if it will be removed or not what you

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,370
can copy and what you will not be able

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,530
to copy all this is then not anymore a

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,540
chain of trust but it's a chain of

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,020
control someone else will control you

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:58,530
what you are allowed to do with this and

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:02,020
this is something which is at the moment

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:04,630
coming more and more to laptops and

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:07,150
desktop computers as well it was already

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,520
hardly implemented in gaming consoles

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:14,410
and ebook weiners we already had them or

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,020
tablet and mobile phones and it's coming

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,540
more and more to the laptops and

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:24,940
desktops with those developments in Muay

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:31,360
via secure boot and tpn so the question

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:33,550
is how do we deal with that what will we

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,679
do about it that other people take away

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,679
control from us as the owners of of

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,540
computers and that they decide what we

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,120
are allowed to do and what we are not

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,950
allowed to do that they decide what we

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,230
are allowed to do with the most powerful

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:55,720
machines the first thing is we have to

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:59,530
resist and it's not that that easy as I

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,840
say because often you think about why do

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:05,980
they do that and how it might be okay

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:09,760
but the first crucial thing is that we

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:12,250
do not accept this that we do not accept

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,240
it in our mind that this is okay to

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,700
limit this powerful

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,040
machine it is not okay that someone else

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,640
decides what we are allowed to do with

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,440
our computers that's not okay we should

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,050
not accept it nobody should accept it

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,320
and we have to do something against it

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,430
and one thing is in your mind already

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,530
don't accept that this is a normal

00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:37,180
condition it's not good for our site

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:41,820
society so we should not accept it but I

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:44,950
guess want to do a little bit more and

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:48,730
all of you already do more because you

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:52,480
are here and so all of you already use

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,850
free software you probably also check

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,400
out our free software works you develop

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,110
it further you share it with others in

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,110
your community you help others to also

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,030
use free software introduce them to it

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,800
you help them to understand how software

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,930
works that they can participate there

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
you make translations so that more

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:13,150
people are able to use the software you

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,000
share the software others and show them

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:19,510
how you can also do this and you help

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,660
people to make the computer work in a

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,820
way which fits their needs help them to

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,600
make modifications so they can use

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:32,740
computers in a way they want so that's a

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:36,820
big contribution to preserve this the

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:39,940
power of this tool of this computer it's

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,670
very important to us and we all have to

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,290
continue doing this because the software

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,390
is the heart of all these machines and

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:50,950
we have to make sure that people can

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:54,100
control this other more specific things

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,940
or to take control about the machine

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,980
itself is help us that we preserve the

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,970
right to tingle or that we get it in

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:08,860
some legislations we should be always

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:13,180
legally allowed to change the hardware

00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:16,810
we own we should always be legally

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:19,690
allowed to install software on our own

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,690
computers without anyone else having to

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,830
give us permission

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:28,880
that we have to fight for this same

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:32,920
thing you saw with the CDs we have you

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,480
can help to to make it sure that those

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,700
devices which have restrictions that

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,070
they are labeled that they have to tell

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,420
you what restrictions they have that the

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,370
normal condition is a general-purpose

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,680
computer and when they restrict what you

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,060
can do with that that they have to tell

00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,190
you what you are not allowed to do with

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,700
it that someone else can delete your

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,560
data that someone else can interpret

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,390
data on it that you are not allowed to

00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,700
install other applications that you are

00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,290
not allowed to do technically it's not

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,180
possible to install another operating

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,790
system and so on that should be on a

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,480
label and so you can make a decision

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:11,660
what you want to buy and what not and

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:15,890
the other is helped to make good

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:18,740
specifications like the trusted

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,810
computing with the tpms and we have you

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,290
secure boot we saw more and more that

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:27,260
they were developed in a way that like

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:29,720
TPM version 1 or 2 was still written in

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,580
a way that they protect the owner that

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,250
the owner has to control and now with

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,230
the trust for version 2 dot 0 it takes

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,540
away this control and gives it to the

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,010
vendors and that's something we have to

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,640
monitor closely and we have to make sure

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,550
that all specifications in this areas

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,880
that they make sure that the owner of a

00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,560
of a hardware is the one who will has

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,570
the control over that and who decides

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,300
what he can do with that on what not and

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,450
not someone else so we have to monitor

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,340
what specifications are they develop it

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,410
will not be it will not happen that at

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,360
one point there is a big step and then

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,920
all those specifications say and the

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,310
owner should not have to control its

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,970
slice pie slice and it's going one step

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,860
after another and with wavy and and the

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,410
tpms be seed is that it's going in this

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,820
direction and when it was easy in the

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,710
long time code was very difficult to

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,010
install a Kleenex on on a laptop

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:32,039
keyboard but we got better and better

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:34,679
with that so in future

00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,450
and we already see that now it will it's

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,600
getting more and more complicated to

00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:44,220
install linux on laptops or desktop

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,519
computers because of that but it is

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:51,059
something those are all things which

00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,340
already on a very high level like if you

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,940
want to encourage someone to also

00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:00,179
develop free software programs come here

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,369
to academy or look at those

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,679
specifications and evaluate and that's

00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:07,109
it's a lot of effort probably and not

00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:16,919
all people can spend so much time on

00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:20,789
that can you read it ok so it's

00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,229
important that we think about ways for

00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,729
more people to participate in this

00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:34,109
movement we have to find easy ways to

00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:37,259
help to do one part and so I want to

00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:39,059
share a few of them on brainstorm a

00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,340
little bit and I hope that afterwards

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:47,190
during conference you can come up with

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:49,200
your own ideas so just when I some some

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,599
ideas what I see around me but what

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
people are doing wear it often depends

00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,919
you you just need a few minutes a week

00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,090
or a few minutes months one thing is

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,919
when people send you dog x attachments

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,590
you right back to them and tell them no

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,210
I don't want to have this can you please

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:10,559
send it as an ODT very small thing and

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,330
depending on how the relationship is

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,129
like if someone else wants something

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,019
from you it's easier if it's your boss

00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:17,970
it might be more difficult some people

00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,859
might not do it with their boss that's

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,200
okay some people might do it with their

00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:24,599
boss that's better but it's always

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,609
something which how comfortable people

00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,090
are they can do something and it's one

00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:35,279
small step the the other thing is like

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:38,429
for example talk about those things with

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,920
politicians politicians they they get

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,120
all kind of crazy ideas from

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,450
other people they discuss with them

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,450
about topics which are you cannot

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,160
imagine what they have to deal with so

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,110
you don't have to be shy to talk with

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,900
them about software freedom go there

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,660
talk with them maybe it's once 15

00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,220
minutes that's okay that's 15 minutes in

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,440
a year where you go to a politician and

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,410
talk with them about it at that point he

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,870
might still think oh what a freak but

00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,930
when there is a fifth person they might

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:15,800
think Oh assistant please research what

00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:20,070
this is about there are things like

00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:22,890
sometimes we are too smart so we already

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,090
know before which shops sell free

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,920
software in on their part there and we

00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,920
already know which which computers we

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,020
can use for that and we don't ask other

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,490
people go to a shop and say can I have

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,680
juicing this device and they say and no

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,300
and then other people also go there and

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,230
then the shops after some time changes

00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:47,010
it so for example in the past when I was

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:49,620
at an electronic shop I always when I

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,260
had like three minutes to spare I asked

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:55,080
the staff do you have any machines with

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,680
free software pre-installed and then

00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,570
depending on my time I I Allah said when

00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,820
they said no I either discussed with

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,890
them why I would like to have this or

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,700
when I didn't have time I just walked

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:11,190
away with a very sad face and again in

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,420
something one person does it not that

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,910
much will happen lots of people do it

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,770
there will be changed totally and it's

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,380
something which doesn't cost you a lot

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:25,200
of money to do this and ask there it's a

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:30,720
few minutes and even if you just do this

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:38,330
once a year that's fine the the other

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:42,180
thing is that like sometimes when

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:46,980
companies sell free software on their

00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:49,020
devices we we should support them and

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,970
it's something where it's very easy to

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,830
say to your friends buy this laptop

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,590
there it's pre-installed yes

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:58,710
a little bit more expensive but you

00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,779
support something good please don't buy

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,470
it there for fifty bucks less and then

00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:05,549
asked me to help you to install it there

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,260
encourage your friends to buy a laptop

00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,360
which are pre-installed with free

00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,570
software it somehow works also other

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,490
like tablets and other devices try to

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,409
give money to those who value your

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,580
freedom and give as little as possible

00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:22,740
to companies to take away your feelings

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:25,200
so that's something porn don't be person

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,710
who tries to how I have want to save

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,630
this last box just to have a little bit

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,500
cheaper if you can afford it support the

00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:38,399
people who develop free software another

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,889
thing which is also very small thing to

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,500
do show that you are part of this

00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:46,289
movement show others that you that you

00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,350
are part of this like when you wear a

00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:52,440
t-shirt you have a pin you put some

00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,419
posters in your office those are all

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,659
small things which show others around

00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:59,880
you that you are working for the same

00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,070
the same thing that you are part of the

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,510
same movement and it's something you

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:08,880
should not underestimate like and when I

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,070
once walked around my neighborhood and

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,019
then I saw someone with a hacking for

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,659
freedom t-shirt and I didn't know that

00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,669
person that's motivated because the

00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,059
others around me who believe in the same

00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:22,590
things it's in some companies they when

00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:26,639
when they suppose is all there someone

00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:29,360
who thinks the same as I do and so also

00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:31,380
like when i was here at the airport

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,059
someone was looking at my teacher

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,269
thought oh you're also going to academy

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:40,260
and so that's how we make people who

00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:43,130
think the same so use this show others

00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,750
that you that you also supported and

00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,970
like I'm once i am most bearing the same

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,820
teacher here in a berlin subway someone

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:55,049
came i'm also using KDE and he was very

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,580
happy so yeah and that's very small

00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:58,950
thing even if you don't change anything

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,080
else show that you do that put it on

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,010
your laptop so other people see what you

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,010
think about and

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,440
what others more thing everybody can do

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:12,820
is and it which also takes very little

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,430
time say thank you to the others in the

00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,380
free software community we often we just

00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,080
tell people oh there is this back there

00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,030
I want this feature and they complain

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,790
and they discuss how to do something

00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:27,220
better and we often forget to say thank

00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,990
you and that's something which is also

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,340
motivating for others and you can help

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:35,770
with this with this movement to support

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,600
it by saying thank you and even if you

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,190
just do it once a year for example at

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,650
the isle of free software day on the

00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:45,780
fourteenth of februari that's something

00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:51,790
which helps 10 minutes here which helps

00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:54,850
so my point is that we have to find new

00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,940
ways very very small things people can

00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:01,450
do things they can easily do and which

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:04,210
are not will be from our expectations

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,280
they are not so high that we we expect

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,200
them to do the same thing we do but that

00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,040
we give them easy things they can don't

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:17,790
do in a few minutes and every person and

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:21,340
every small activity cowans there and

00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:24,820
there are still many people around the

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:27,700
world who don't benefit from fundamental

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:30,940
freedoms like freedom of the press

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,120
freedom of assembly freedom of speech

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:36,550
privacy or other freedoms we take as

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,300
granted they have to fight for them

00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:44,080
every day and once you have them it

00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:46,630
doesn't stop there we have to defend all

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,410
our freedoms again and again as a

00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,660
society we have to

00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,160
vendors and its ongoing thing it's not

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,180
something you have it once and then is

00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,650
there for all and as our world today

00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,300
consists of so many computers around us

00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:03,170
and they are have such a dominant

00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:05,630
position we also need to fight and we

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:10,669
need to protect software freedom and the

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:12,919
right to control our technology so thank

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:15,560
you and thank you for listening and

00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:17,710
thank you all for contributing to face

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,710
off

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:30,530
thank you told us do we have questions

00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:42,770
Matthias I think we need to the 50

00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:45,649
minutes good investment hello so why

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:47,960
don't you about the greatest movement in

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:53,030
the new small Harbor civilian where

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:56,470
people eat everything basically so the

00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,470
question was what I think about makers

00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:10,640
those are very important I mean I don't

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,450
want that all the other computers out

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,099
there are not that is a possibility

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,250
there to use them as general purpose

00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:22,579
computers but if it comes to worst those

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:24,559
might be our last defense lines and it's

00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:27,319
important that we don't just control the

00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:30,650
the software but as I said that we are

00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:32,809
also allowed to modify the hardware our

00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,420
own hardware we should not be limited by

00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:37,549
someone else that we are that we can

00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,500
modify it and adopted to our needs so

00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:41,420
those movements are very important and

00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,180
they very nice hip together with you

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,119
with the free software movement yeah I

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,559
hope they continue and are such

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:57,400
successful as the free software movement

00:35:48,559 --> 00:36:02,510
have been before strong the mind of

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:05,589
google very good no I guess either in

00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,589
the freezer burn

00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:12,900
oh well they have a much larger budget

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:20,760
than for some free software foundation

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:24,180
Europe it's I mean first of all

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:29,390
sometimes it's it's not that we fight

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:32,190
them it's meanwhile it's more complex so

00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:35,820
Microsoft they are now also developing

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,820
free software in some part they are

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,670
providing free software installations

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:43,830
where you can buy the service from them

00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,470
Google they also do a lot of free

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:49,500
software things so in some parts there

00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:54,090
are joint goals in others there are

00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:58,980
different goals and yes it's difficult

00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:01,140
when you have different goals to to to

00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,260
counter those on a political level they

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,660
have so many people in Brussels to do

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,710
not being there look at the last number

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:13,110
soon for example etting are is is

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,940
meeting with you see ok there's people

00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,310
from google microsoft all the time there

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,230
and i can tell you that episode ii

00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,630
didn't have a meeting yet with him so

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,320
it's difficult there but on the other

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,660
hand we are many we are a lot of people

00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,330
and a lot of people from us they don't

00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:34,890
do it in their paid time why we do it as

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:37,230
volunteers and so i think it's it's

00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:40,170
something which in the long run in the

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:43,050
short term they are always more powerful

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:48,960
but when you look at the development for

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:50,850
a long time i think it's it's on our

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,460
side that they slowly develop into our

00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:56,760
direction and it's more going this

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,770
direction that we the data dog free

00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,580
software and that they use more of

00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:04,740
disadvantages but it's something we have

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,080
to of course we have to invest to make

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,510
sure that that we can still protect that

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,619
where we have to do all those small

00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,480
steps and

00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,249
all of you do this and all of you

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,369
convince others to do some of those

00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:20,009
small steps I don't think that an

00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,289
employee from Microsoft or Google can

00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:24,480
convince people about their position can

00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:27,480
convince people around them about their

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,349
physicians that something you you do

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,349
when you're paid for it

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:54,720
mostly proprietary software and if you

00:38:47,339 --> 00:39:03,569
buy I mean SST for example how do you do

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:06,539
oh sweet deal Mindy before that it was

00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:10,020
very easy way to say like hardware

00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:15,089
operating system there are many layers

00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:17,789
between and we have to to work on those

00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:21,299
layers too we have to make sure that we

00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:23,609
control the buyers things like coal moon

00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:26,869
or lip LaBute we should make sure that

00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:31,920
we can change the firmware of of

00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:34,349
different different hardware and if you

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:40,260
are not able to do this we will lose a

00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:42,000
strong heart so yeah we have to invest

00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,630
resources into this that this is also

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,630
free software

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:20,799
tremendously useful services so software

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:23,739
gets into this computer so how do you do

00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:30,219
can this conflict be resolved without

00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:34,599
giving up so that's actually could be a

00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:37,989
whole talk so I concentrate here on on

00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:41,440
the part of controllability of our own

00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:42,999
computers the thing you mentioned is

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:49,539
that more and more is moving to others

00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:51,729
computers like if you want to have some

00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:58,390
sticker at some me as well in this bag

00:40:51,729 --> 00:41:00,099
so yeah we have to find solutions for

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,019
this as well but it's a little bit more

00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:05,160
complicated like how can you make sure

00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:07,690
that you are for example allowed to run

00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,150
modified versions on someone's else

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,309
computer as well so that you have

00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,170
similar rights and it would be your own

00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:17,019
computer how can we make sure that we

00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:20,410
can move our data to two other providers

00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:22,799
without losing any control over them so

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,599
there are many things there like here

00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,249
think that the user data manifesto for

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,979
some is a very good way forward with

00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:35,049
this there are many many questions which

00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:38,709
are still open there d why I was

00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:41,140
highlighting this was that it's

00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:43,959
important that we also own some

00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,890
computers some of those computers belong

00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:51,699
to us so that we are always able to have

00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:55,630
those computers at least to perform some

00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:56,940
something some of our tasks in a wave

00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,670
actually Leon

00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,609
we don't depend on anyone else and by

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:06,990
owning a device that's that's actually a

00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:08,579
very good step to to do this so it's but

00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:11,190
it's two things we need both because

00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:13,290
many of the things which which is done

00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,000
on other people's computers they are so

00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:19,040
powerful we cannot have those computers

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,040
at home and yeah

00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:44,109
so many more questions otherwise collect

00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,109
appears once

00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,349
