Title: Daniel Vratil - LibAsync: Simlify Your Asyncronous Code - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	LibAsync is a small generic library I wrote to simplify chaining of asynchronous jobs and make it possible to do small asynchronous tasks easily without having to use KJob API. In this talk I will briefly introduce the library, show a few use cases and compare them with the standard KJob API.

LibAsync was originally created as part of the Akonadi Next effort, but it's generic enough to be used by any Qt-based project.

It allows to chain multiple asynchronous jobs in one place, making it easier to follow what's happening in the code and debug it. The jobs can be passed in as KJobs, simple functions or even lambda functions.

This talk is targeted at all developers who use KJobs in their applications and are interested in simplifying their codebase.
