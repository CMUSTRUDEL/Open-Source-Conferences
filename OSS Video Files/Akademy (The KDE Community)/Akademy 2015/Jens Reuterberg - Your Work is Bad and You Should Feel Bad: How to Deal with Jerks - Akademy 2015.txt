Title: Jens Reuterberg - Your Work is Bad and You Should Feel Bad: How to Deal with Jerks - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Open Source is an awesome community, but it has its fair share of problem users. We should accept that and learn how to deal with them instead of pretending they don't exist.

This is an older talk I did at Qt Dev Days about problem users, using the Futurama Characters as templates for each and talking about how to deal with each of them and about the benefits of sticking together when we encounter them.
Now with added content and more concrete ways of dealing with the forementioned jerks!
The concept is to take a serious issue within opensource, making it a bit funny but also discuss why its so relevant to talk about.
