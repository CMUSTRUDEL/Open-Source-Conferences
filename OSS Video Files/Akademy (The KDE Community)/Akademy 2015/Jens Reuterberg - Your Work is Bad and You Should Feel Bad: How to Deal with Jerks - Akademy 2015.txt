Title: Jens Reuterberg - Your Work is Bad and You Should Feel Bad: How to Deal with Jerks - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Open Source is an awesome community, but it has its fair share of problem users. We should accept that and learn how to deal with them instead of pretending they don't exist.

This is an older talk I did at Qt Dev Days about problem users, using the Futurama Characters as templates for each and talking about how to deal with each of them and about the benefits of sticking together when we encounter them.
Now with added content and more concrete ways of dealing with the forementioned jerks!
The concept is to take a serious issue within opensource, making it a bit funny but also discuss why its so relevant to talk about.

	00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,090
okay we have a short amount of time and

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,130
I'm going to talk about trolls how many

00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,570
here is active on social media and stuff

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,100
like that I'm going to assume everyone

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,470
but just raise your hand so I get some

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,689
sort of sense of back and forth right

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,750
okay so you all met how many here have

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,630
actually met abusive aggressive annoying

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,930
or in general time-wasting uses I see

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,970
one hand erase that and yeah okay like

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,600
we we've all met them I'm going to sit

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,850
down for a second because that's going

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,190
to be annoying again I want to talk

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,030
about these abrasive users and how to

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,730
deal with them using the absolutely best

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,460
way to do that the drama the best show

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,800
ever it's a firefly because it has all

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,910
the necessary character you upload if

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,210
you want because firefly back in the air

00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,790
you like enough pandering to the crowd

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:09,780
it has some of the base personalities

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,750
available with our users we have a bunch

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,630
of them and the majority are brilliant

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,190
brilliant people but some of them are

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,900
sort of not worth the time some of them

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,370
are but you don't want to waste too much

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,530
time on it so I'm going to go through

00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,020
the most usually Cashin ones and there's

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,740
a reason for this whole failure and with

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,420
that reason so it's cling to it okay the

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,720
first most typical annoying user I found

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
is the noob the person who does

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,710
something horrible to whatever you've

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,240
done and then blame that or something

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,110
like the distro and then switch the

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,390
distro usually a nice person they're

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,190
happy to switch they only broke i'm

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,090
going to switch to linux mint normal

00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:00,600
switch to arch for some reason and arch

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,070
is great but not for news and that the

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,930
wing to handle this person for example

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,460
that's just being nice introduced into

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,800
the community in a suit yeah you're

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,840
going to switch around a bit

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,910
this drove up and it's fine being nice

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,380
be extremely nice that is kind of

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:17,570
specific time wasting user i'm also

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,500
doing them in rates of how annoying they

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:24,440
are so this is the least annoying one

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,870
the next one is the troll the bender the

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,670
person who just for the hell of it will

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,540
just go in and you know right out it's

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,130
gnu/linux actually or you know richard

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,380
stallman does it like this or whatever

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,200
it might be they have different tactics

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,220
and they're fun and really annoying and

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,570
as usual ignore them that's the only

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,100
character here that you can safely

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,090
ignore because they're just going to be

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:53,390
a bracelet for fun for loves the third

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,850
one is the aggro the person when

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,770
something goes wrong they go ballistic

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,590
I'm sure you've all read this someone

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,920
just liking like swear words where would

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,800
swear and swear word kubuntu swear words

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,720
where as well and you know yeah it broke

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,580
but it's not the end of the world and

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,260
you ask oh did you lose some sort of

00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,560
information no no it's just annoying

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,470
yeah it's annoying the only the best way

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,470
to solve this sort of person is not to

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,290
be to be inclusive to be the person that

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,060
goes the I know it's so annoying me

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,400
there's a bug report we're working on

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,340
but just you know try to make them a

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,690
part of your team instead don't pay them

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,180
too much mine because they're going to

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,550
let go in a second they're going to do

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,340
an entire frozen and just let it go and

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,410
move along to something else and then be

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,170
angry about that or we all find himself

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:50,030
again and that's fine but just these

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:51,860
people are not that bad this is my hate

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,110
person actually this is what the one I

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,920
hate almost the most and it's the

00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,030
know-it-all the Gary or girl who go into

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,980
thread and tell developers that I know

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,410
genius peoplesmart they know what

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,630
they're talking about they can tell that

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,660
person to the face that they're

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,340
absolutely long

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,590
don't know anything about that thing

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,210
they worked with for three years because

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,820
they read something of the kapadia and

00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,410
you know they're obviously better than

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,290
you and the only way to deal with these

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,300
people is simply going here here's file

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,590
a bug report or help out and then let

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:31,530
ignore them don't reply don't even reply

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,790
once too often because just say this is

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,340
the bar report and then let it be

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,580
because these people will talk forever

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,620
and they will be upset that you don't

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,360
say all right okay you are the knob

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,100
you're now the main dad for this project

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,640
you know I'm done here you're obviously

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,610
better than me even though the crud then

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,940
comes this this guy Hermes Conrad the

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:58,170
lawyer the person who has a war on a

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:02,190
small detail and they will do anything

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:06,390
to bring this up I know David Edmondson

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,460
and a certain user on reddit his its

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,600
let's not name the person but it's an

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,550
Egyptian king born 1979 and this person

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,570
had if you write something about KDE on

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:22,560
linux the reddit for linux he will go in

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:26,190
and spew on you for mentioning it and

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,770
talk about cute for hours he will not

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,750
stop he would just continue and you go

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,940
this is nothing there's nothing about

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,700
cute here yeah sure it's cute face the

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,550
volume here you hate us please go away

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,680
and he won't he'll just returned over

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,930
and over and over and a certain point

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,290
you snap you will always snap you always

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:51,000
go 0 for like David it in a good way in

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:53,400
a good way and he will he will never go

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,950
away so this is the specific sort of

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,330
person again you can safely ignore

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,760
they're not about no one's going to

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,930
reference back to them and go this

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,340
Egyptian king born 1979 he said this and

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,320
this and this because it's not an

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,680
argument this will never come back to

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,930
haunt you if you normal but yeah it's

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,810
the last ones that are that will come

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,430
back to haunt us yes

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:24,819
yeah I know he's an accountant but it's

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:30,139
weird I did she just take technology yes

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:32,990
ok this is the one I I don't have run

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,849
into them at some times but you know who

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,150
they are they are the people who will

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:42,099
turn up in a Fred and then say look I

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:45,919
downloaded your application or os or

00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:47,930
desktop environment you owe me here fix

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,150
these rings or I will be upset and I

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,720
will not use it anymore and you go well

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,000
who cares that's usually how I react

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,479
it's sort of the f1 go away bother

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,479
someone else they will then go on to say

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,360
after a wall you know it's this the way

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,580
you treat customers and then you start

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,710
to think this person really think that

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,050
they paid me money somehow magically by

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,180
using the stuff I've done and they do

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,449
and they will never stopped because this

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,180
is a very common cultural phenomena

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,130
phenomenal now that people assume that

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,009
everyone must be either a customer or a

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,870
seller and when you're a customer center

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,580
there are certain archetypes you have to

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,979
fill certain roles you have to play with

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,590
them don't this is one of those

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,690
situations without which can come back

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,000
to haunt you badly so what you need to

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,620
do then is to make sure that other

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,659
developers are ready to back you up and

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,509
simply go no we're not we haven't sold

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,599
anything to you or as either propose

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,819
that we should buy windows license for

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,039
this person because you know let it be

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,490
their problem the worst worst worst

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,199
worst worst kind in the final one is

00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,800
solberg the loser the person whose life

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,020
is so horribly bad that they will just

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
cling on to you because you made

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,000
something they kind of like and then.we

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,190
upset at you forever they love you they

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,639
love you with all their life but they

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,800
hate you at the same

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,770
you actually come back and just just

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,879
insult people they can stalk people from

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,830
forums to their blogs and onward to let

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,199
it there are some developers who met

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,389
this kind of person who will never ever

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,430
ever ever give up their life is so

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,949
horrible that this is essentially the

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,289
entire enjoyment this is the specific

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,740
one that sort of popped up a lot in KDE

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:39,120
circles about a year back and the

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,849
situation I really want to talk about

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
because these are the times where other

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,540
developers other designers people

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,240
involved in community needs to step up

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,850
and sort of tag team the person he or

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,399
she is attacking out simply go yeah okay

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,320
he or she will not require our reply

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,449
this is the thing because we need to

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,970
start backing each other up and the

00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:01,470
reason this whole thing this all

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,260
lightning talk the reason you're sitting

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,149
there playing with your smartphone's the

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,449
reason I talked about it is because I

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:11,430
really wanted to want us all of us to

00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:13,790
start going into forms be active in

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,740
social forms and try to keep a tab on

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:20,070
users of other developers and see if

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,660
they need help be gracious obviously you

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,070
can be kind you can be friendly you

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,649
don't have to be mean to them or

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,540
anything but you have to know to always

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,000
react to certain people and oats

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,070
specifically if they are songbirds

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,220
people who attack a specific developer

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,779
and cling onto them that's when you have

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,300
to step in that's where you have to go

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,399
any lower look you're behaving like an

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,579
 sorry you're behaving like an

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,370
idiot and you obviously shouldn't so

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:50,640
this is me like be ready to pound them

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:54,839
from forums as well and I would like to

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,750
see us all take a bigger step out into

00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,220
social media and be more active in the

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,320
way we talk to each other the way we

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,940
sort of back each other up and the way

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,470
we invite more people into the community

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,180
because there's one thing to talk about

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,089
community there's completely different

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,610
thing when community is simply a bunch

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,970
of targets ready to be shot up by trolls

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,660
and we can't keep saying oh you guess

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,640
they

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,130
just ignore them because at a certain

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,870
point it won't work we'll lose

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,910
developers this way we'll lose people

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,100
people may not even want to go into that

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,340
community if they say that oh they're

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,520
being attacked all the time and this is

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:35,250
common with a design it usually struck

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,240
sout to know miss honors and know some

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,760
who've taken a lot of beading and maybe

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,740
they do a little icon but the second oh

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,460
I'm a global designer and then they'll

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,990
hear it they'll get spanked around and

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,610
we don't want that for developers or the

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,200
slimmest we want to be able to stick it

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,170
stick up for each other and have a

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,810
growing sort of escalating community and

00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,150
for that we have to be able to meet

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,800
these falls and do something about them

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,800
and that's me

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,560
if anyone has a question I'll be amazed

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,630
okay I'm the new I break things but I'm

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,340
kind of happy when they break and go

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,580
I'll move to another destroyed because

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,810
that's the level of knowledge I have I'm

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,000
uncritically decided that's essentially

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,280
i do pretty things and then the

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,960
technical day I'm constantly amazed by

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,160
it that's why I actually like to turn up

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,200
to these things because it's like

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,630
talking to wizards it's like being

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:57,050
invited to harm works to talk like oh

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:57,050
you do magic oh so yeah I'm awesome

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,980
