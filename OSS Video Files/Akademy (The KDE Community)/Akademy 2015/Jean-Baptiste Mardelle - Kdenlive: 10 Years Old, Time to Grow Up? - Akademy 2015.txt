Description: 
	The Kdenlive video editor is about 10 years old, and a lot of challenges are still ahead of us. In this presentation, I will talk about some of the weaknesses / stengths of the project. I will also discuss the results of the recent integration of KDE Applications, the reflections that came with it and what we can learn from other great KDE applications.

Some of the recent/future developments will be presented, as well and I will be happy to share ideas with you about the evolution of open source video editing in today's world.
