Title: Devaja Shah - KDE Love: Humans of KDE - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	The talk shall emphasize on the community motivations and what inspires a set of diverse people to use and contribute to KDE. We shall be focusing on this by citing instances from some of the most inspiring stories of contributions from people and their commitment towards KDE and how KDE changed their lives. By gaining an insight into the bond between the KDE community and the members as individuals and how they connect on an individual level, we shall talk of how to sustain this by collective community efforts and how to engage and motivate more people to contribute.

This talk emphasizes on the essences of the KDE Community and the primary community principles that bind KDE people together. We talk of how such a diverse set of people identify themselves with KDE, and find a sense of belonging to people they haven’t even seen or met before in their lives. The talk shall be dealing with the stories and a few video snippets from Users, Developers, Documentation Team, Maintenance People, Promo Team, Student Participants and shall observe and exhibit the common threads of their motivations and leanings behind becoming a part of KDE and why it means so much to them. The talk aims at bringing out a few of the most inspiring stories of individuals who’ve almost devoted an entirety of their lifetime to KDE and to let this be an epitome for all the people present at Akademy of the passion and commitment to the KDE community. The talk shall conclude in drawing out a few very important commonalities and integrating elements which inspire people to use and contribute to KDE and we shall talk of mechanisms via which these key “strength points” and “redeeming traits” of the KDE community can be advanced even further by ensuring we reinforce and strengthen them via numerous activities which help their spread.

Katie long what is it going to be about

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:45,280

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:47,850
so um Katie love now my thing is they

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,500
hit their you you see so many dogs

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,000
having weird names like shashlik and

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,870
welcome to Massachusetts and no one

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,739
really asked me what they mean but Katie

00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,720
love is yeah so that's what I'm talking

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,509
about we focus on a lot of complex stuff

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,690
and a lot of analysis of what's going on

00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:10,600
of quantitative data of numbers of a lot

00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,180
of stuff of surveys campaigns but

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,430
sometimes you forget about the very most

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,910
simple thing that binds us all together

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:22,479
just the very simple stuff and that is

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,210
what it is love love for Katie and yeah

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,050
so that's what the talk is going to be

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:31,000
about about people about what inspires

00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,550
them to contribute to Katie and what

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,550
keeps them glued to carry after so many

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:41,410
years so some of the back to the basics

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:44,860
yeah so what is our biggest asset here

00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:47,080
it's humans its people and its diversity

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,840
we have so many different from so many

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,239
places from with so many diverse

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,610
opinions so much to contribute and in so

00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,099
many different facets and that's the

00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:00,310
best part how to channel that that

00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:02,649
diversity and not try to deconstruct it

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,200
but try to constructively utilize that

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:09,099
and help that two make Kerry more

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:14,709
encompassing and more big and welcoming

00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:17,319
yeah so um what I did was that I took

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,620
some live human demos that's how you're

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,490
gonna see right now sorry about 15 to 20

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:30,060
people

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:33,240
yeah so they're mostly a lot of drunken

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,250
fever from the party last night and as

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,010
they say when you're drunk you never

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,510
lies so you speak from the heart and a

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,570
few simple questions about what they do

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:56,760
where they're from and what invokes the

00:02:42,570 --> 00:03:13,440
love for Gideon's item so yeah um okay

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:16,760

pretty much in a different oh whoa I

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:21,090

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,030
of things like I would suffer much in it

00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:12,229
makes me I wanted to so there is always

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:17,560

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:22,789
another right yes watch you go you guys

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:28,400

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:33,789
about this mountain so what is it about

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:39,800
et NEFAs keeps you sir gives me time to

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:42,260
parts of it one is the environment and i

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,700
liked it i use it

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:51,140
the best times the first time like the

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:58,160
tape is a classic reader people I have

00:08:51,140 --> 00:09:09,830
into the low 30 and now in here in Korea

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:29,840
what people what is your most memorable

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:41,050
of it at the time because it felt like

00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:41,050
we were all okay

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,860
I ever

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:39,160
Senate starts you can I think yeah ok so

00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:41,620
the video thing is a bit it's

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,720
misbehaving a little bit we can I think

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,160
by the end of the talk watch all of the

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:54,040
videos so yeah here's a fun fact that

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,709
it's not very little but if you come to

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,149
understand of the human brain words

00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:00,189
would be the long-term memories in the

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,560
short-term memories but you see is that

00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:05,500
what stays in your brain always is

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,449
always has some amount of an emotional

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,850
connect to it that's what they say that

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,880
the long-term memories are generally to

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,170
do with an important part of your life

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:20,380
so the point is is there after 15 years

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:24,759
you may probably forget the syntax of it

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,649
while loop C++ but you're not going to

00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,019
forget the people of Katie you're not

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,360
gonna forget the memories that I share

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:36,930
the bonds that you have the fun times

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,930
very rough but yes

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,000
so the point was that they met yesterday

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,660
after a long time and he didn't

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:38,230
recognize vishesh without the haircut oh

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:41,320
yeah lots of beers so yeah the point is

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,910
that the bomb let people share with

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,060
Katie the bond that people have with

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,890
Academy is kind of like a wine that goes

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,140
and gets more seasoned than tasteful

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,120
with time it sighs you put all the love

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,010
you put all the memories in an iterative

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,650
loop and it keeps on going on and on

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,050
again but with a greater intent is

00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,520
intensity and that's what makes it

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,430
better and better then you keep on

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,959
coming back but obviously your first

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,110
Academy is going to be the most special

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,200
one but with each and every time that

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,970
people meet you channel and all of the

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,700
energy that you get from other people

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,640
you learn so much you explore so much

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,610
and it just keeps on reminding you of

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,100
everything did you miss out in your

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:29,160
everyday life when you're not thinking

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:32,790
of Katie when you're not doing Katie so

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,709
it's all about that personal touch that

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:42,459
human element that we have out here and

00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:45,550
how do we invoke that in paper so game

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:49,300
started with it um we

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:54,310
and India we organized Katie meet up and

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:57,420
cons the K radar in 42 consecutive years

00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:01,779
and we had this huge crowd of 350 people

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,940
400 people but the point was it would be

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,829
realized with that was that the number

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,589
of people that attend is not what

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:10,990
matters for the number of productive

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:13,480
people the number of people that are

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,200
actually inspired enough is what matters

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,899
so even a small scale focused event that

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,390
is very much more better than a

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,089
large-scale group event consisting of

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,300
let's say 300 people because the whole

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:30,910
point is that even in an event of 30 if

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,950
you give that personal attention and

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,519
focus to each and every individual out

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,290
there it creates a sort of bonding with

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,779
sort of comfortable what you see are

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,779
there with a lot of students like a lot

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:47,019
of people asked me yesterday is that how

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,550
do you get students to start with Katie

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,760
how do you get students to start with

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,980
open source and what happens is that

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,860
there are lot mentoring programs out

00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,010
there and a lot of other opportunities

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,500
but when you see events such as these

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,300
the conversion rate of the students

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,940
getting into cirque open source of

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,470
mentoring programs like less so what

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,270
happens to the rest of the people is

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,770
that they either fall out or whose

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,899
interest or were they just think they're

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,620
getting a g-shock or an s okay is that

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:19,990
too difficult and the point is that some

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,440
people maybe maybe so but they may still

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,230
be really interested and just paying

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,250
that amount of course the tension in

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,430
getting controller

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:35,410
is what makes that difference and giving

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:38,320
the talk and inspiring 300 people is I

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,900
don't know it seems to be some mounting

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,650
to a lot in terms of numbers but when

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,080
you come to think of it it's just 10 or

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:53,350
5 at the end of the day who end up

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:55,420
contributing so yeah so um one important

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,630
thing is that a lot of college going

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,120
students especially in the first year

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:04,750
now for 12 years of their life they've

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,510
been using Windows they've been using if

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,720
not known more open sources and when you

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,150
start out with college that's like the

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,700
colorful memorable most stage of a

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,560
student where if he gets into the habit

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,070
of using something that's where as you

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,600
can follow that habit and use it for the

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:28,630
rest of his life so what we saw add you

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,050
know the Amrita University in Kerala

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,730
where we had our last cons what we saw

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:38,470
there was that the professor they're

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,480
used to challenge the students and as

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,150
part of their academic program they had

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,130
an introduction course to open source so

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,839
each and every student in a class of 60

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,670
was supposed to pick one open source

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,800
projects from all those out there and

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,839
start contributing to attract is our day

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,750
now when you see with a lot of students

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,060
is that academic requirements and a lot

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,670
of class work is what stops them from

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,580
contributing to Gideon for paying a lot

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,800
of attention but if you see from the

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,470
mind of an 80

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,450
what katie looks that quick that's a

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,460
what i can say it looked like back to me

00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:16,270
it's an adventure it's something new

00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:18,520
it's exciting so even if i may fail it

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,070
it works i don't stick around i'll still

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,900
give it a try and that is with the most

00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:28,390
important thing is giving that push and

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,630
making Katie if you seem so exciting

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:35,050
enough to get the students through I

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:43,900
don't know just take a punch in and try

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:46,600
contributing so yeah so what are a few

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:50,320
of the motivations that you can tell

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,870
people to get started academy is one of

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,370
the biggest deals it's fresh air people

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,320
we've got so many people and yeah so

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,840
what would you tell an average young

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,430
person to get started it's like you get

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,560
to make new friends you get to travel

00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,810
you get to explore and you get to do

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,570
something worthwhile out of your time

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:14,110
you're using your most constructive time

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:17,110
in an effective way if you see right in

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,250
the period before the summer vacation

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,260
start there is a great need for events

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,810
which not just focus on mentoring

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,360
programs which is contributing to a lot

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:31,090
of open source projects in the sense

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,610
that in Hudson utilized their time

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,360
effectively and adds to the resume also

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:40,510
and what needs to be done is to organize

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:47,530
more such focused events around that

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:52,410
time yeah so um what I was talking about

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:55,770
was consisted gentle touch and pushes so

00:18:52,410 --> 00:19:00,780
if I can talk from a past experience

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:03,480
what we saw was that at K Damita in 2013

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,240
we have the same conference of

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,180
around 200 people and there were going

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,940
to 30 kids out there who traveled a lot

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,160
and they could really understand what

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,620
was going on there and it was really

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,820
difficult to place was too quick for

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:23,640
them and as you see in a large crowded

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,880
group you cannot focus that individual

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,070
attention to everyone so what happened

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,470
was that they were not leaving their

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,330
like we're not understanding and think

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,820
we should just go and what happened was

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,480
it pretty to stop them and he sat down

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,010
with them he often their problems he

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,320
asked each and every one of them what is

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,990
it that you found so difficult what was

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,870
your pain point and what he did was he

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,820
organized separate sessions for all of

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,050
them with separate volunteers hands-on

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:57,120
sessions and you had a separate area

00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,980
with those kids where they got focused

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,530
attention they got personalized touch

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,470
and that's exactly what I'm talking

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,600
about it's about each and every one of

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,510
us we contribute to carry and we know so

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:16,710
much about Katie but how do we pass it

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:18,630
on to other kids and yeah so getting

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,150
them on board that's the main thing so

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,470
try connecting to them at a personal

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,050
level and with the work that they

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:29,040
already do like I can talk personally

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:31,710
that I am a computer science student but

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,170
I'm really passionate about writing so

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,090
what happened was that a senior's mine

00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,720
told me that since you right why don't

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,990
you write for Katie so um that really

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,320
helped me in a way that someone that I

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:49,680
used some one leg um and your personal

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,040
level they recommended Katie to me and

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,540
they said you right and you like doing

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,110
it so why not do it for open source

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,730
trial boozers so that's how I got

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,610
started

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,710
and coincidentally it was not because of

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,210
any mentoring program or episode because

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,799
of anything else or it wasn't even

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,750
contribution to code but it was

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,620
contribution to the promotion team that

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:17,470
got me started so what I'm trying to say

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:19,910
is that there's always a part of you

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:24,230
primary passion that you have let it

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:28,160
let's say it's music or it's um coding

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:30,980
or its artwork or anything timothy aaron

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,280
he he started out as an artist but then

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,559
he got into Katie because of it and

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,720
that's how he started coding so there

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:43,520
are lot of people who do not start out

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,990
as um into development or into

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,570
technology but they have different

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,600
passions and katie is this one place

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,020
where any passion of yours indicator to

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,870
be it writing if you're into music you

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,809
can either down to the developer and

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,820
discuss and try to make an application

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:03,919
go and slowly but try you to have a

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:08,450
dedicated effort into doing something

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:11,870
which really excite you so yeah and

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,090
that's in a way that because when my

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,070
seniors reached out to me and saw there

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,500
I had some potential that really helped

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,770
me and a lot of us meet a lot of people

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,700
around us every day just people there we

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:28,610
know friends relatives lot of them and

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,950
um there are lot of things that everyone

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,900
is passionate about just try to get them

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:37,790
to connect with Katie in a way that

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:39,919
they're comes to Google and yeah so too

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,220
are you channeling oh that their passion

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
towards their hobbies or their

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,970
extracurricular activities and try

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,669
combining that finding a sub of

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:58,730
conferencing or point between both them

00:22:51,669 --> 00:23:00,800
yeah so and after that as as they say

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,980
there's no looking back once

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,970
getting you and and when there's it's

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,090
something that you're really passionate

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:13,520
about that is something which really

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:18,770
excites that passion in you which witch

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,690
just keeps you going and even if

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,390
sometimes someone gets a bit inactive or

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:27,470
lazy take the first step be their

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,450
personal mentor be there sort of

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,610
unofficial mentor but yeah take the

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,920
first step awesome how they're doing why

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,140
not Katie what problems there been times

00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,670
when I kind of like those little bit you

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,800
to work but there's always been someone

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,900
saying hey this is coming up do you want

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,450
to help out with it and it always feels

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,310
nice to know that you remembered your it

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,880
Katie that people appreciate your work

00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:52,430
that people out here I really value you

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,750
and they want to know what you're doing

00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:58,760
and they want to know more of you and

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:02,000
it's all about that connection that you

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:05,090
share with people that compatibility

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,520
level there you have it sometimes maybe

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,310
even it's not for kidding but for the

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,500
people is Katie that's what you know

00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:17,990
always takes and always connects that's

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:21,050
what always keeps you going so yeah so

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,700
the problem here is that we always like

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,120
complain that a lot of mentoring

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,880
students don't follow up they don't

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:33,410
continue working or they don't let's go

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,390
up for the time period but um we always

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,300
expect them to continue their own accord

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:43,150
good we always all of us needs a little

00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:48,950
push and it's our only the case yeah so

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:51,020
um human own related drives yeah and we

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:56,000
as people of Katie we can be that for

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:58,100
someone else and another important thing

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,130
that I wanted to point out is the north

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,270
or Katy contributors

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:07,420
skating users and what happens a lot of

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,540
times is that for 12 years of your lives

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,340
for even more than that what happens is

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,860
a lot of universities together they've

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,770
been using a particular operating system

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,720
their entire likes so when someone

00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,850
thinks of open source what you

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,680
automatically jump to the conclusion is

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:29,050
that ok just erase your existing data

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,950
and everything you just just adding new

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:35,740
operating system but that's not exactly

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:39,490
what the KD community should I mean yeah

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,760
so the point is that taking your golf

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,560
contributors that start contributing to

00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,940
Katie and that is how they fall in love

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,320
with alien thats how they start using

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:52,930
Katie for a lot of people operating he

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,900
knocks and getting started with Linux is

00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,060
like taking a deep dive into a pool

00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:03,240
without any floating rings or anything

00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:06,430
so once they get started with different

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,510
facets of Katie no one carries that's

00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:14,050
how even while contributing to Katie you

00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:16,600
fall in love with what Katie in itself

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,160
is you see people talking about it you

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,210
see people using it you see people

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,580
loving it and that's maybe how they

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:30,280
themselves realize that yeah it's

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:33,670
something that's so amazing yeah so

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,030
that's somebody just tiny little

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:39,880
something called Katie love and it's in

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,530
all of us and it's all about you know

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,710
connecting with the humans out there

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:48,580
just pushing yourself out there making a

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,710
bit of an effort and yeah just focusing

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,040
a bit more on the tiny little things

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:56,560
that drive people to work through its

00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,240
Katie and we have lawyers we have

00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,240
artists we have people from very

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,030
different background

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,070
but there's still some passionate bit

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,390
like there are people who are into

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,390
politics who've studied political

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,850
science but they're still in to open

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,160
source they're not exactly related to

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,720
technology but they're into open source

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:20,500
because that is what it represents to

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,970
them a symbol of freedom and yeah so if

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,940
these tiny little things are followed

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:34,910

00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:18,920
developing cute applications well then

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:20,900
start out with using linux or kitty

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,420
because they're too afraid to do it but

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:27,230
they start out with dominique you on

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:30,619
