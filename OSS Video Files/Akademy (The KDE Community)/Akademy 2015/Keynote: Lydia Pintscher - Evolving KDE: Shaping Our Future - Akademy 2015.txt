KDE has a long history of delivering great end-user software. We are changing. The world around us is changing. We need to take charge so we can continue to deliver free and open software at a time when our users need it the most.

Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? These are the questions we need to ask ourselves and find answers to. Evolving KDE started with a survey to get broad input on these questions. Let's have a look at the results and what they mean for KDE's future.
