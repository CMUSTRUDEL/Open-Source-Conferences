Title: Boudewijn Rempt & Sebastian Kügler - Embracing Mobile - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Plasma 5's first release brought us all a new, modernized desktop with traditional interface paradigms in order to ease the transition for our large group of existing users. It welcomes new users with a familiar interface to get their work done.

Plasma has, however, always had ambitions beyond the desktop. Plasma has been built from the ground up to share code across a device range. Under the motto sharing where possible, diversification where beneficial, Plasma 5 sports a mechanism to dynamically load a device-specific UI. In its early releases, this feature hasn't been in the spotlight.

Now the time has come to bring Plasma to a wider range of systems. In their talk, Boudewijn and Sebastian will devise a strategy to extend Plasma's usage scenarios beyond its traditional target devices, and perhaps surprise the audience with something shiny and new.

The talk is suitable for a general audience and doesn't require any specific technological background.

	00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,410
this is the doc we've all been waiting

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:18,470
for we have two speakers moving from

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,500
training and longtime contributor and

00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:33,590
Sydney in many families telling us all

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:37,130
of this exciting adventure like I so

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,590
welcome to disco we put the rest for

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,070
well it's been a really exciting project

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:48,739
for both of you workin it costs six

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:50,570
seven months so what's up with that what

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,129
what I want what happened in trying to

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:58,640
do will be trying to bring a smile to

00:00:54,129 --> 00:01:02,629
see now why are we believe is glad was

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,360
associated words the reason is that the

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:09,170
exact existing mobile phone systems are

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,410
wait it's just haven't heard MP know

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:15,740
today if got distance apart and you

00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:20,180
can't really do anything except what

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:25,040
mental capacity so what we're trying to

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,840
do is break out of the wall guards we've

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,940
been trying to make sure that we

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,080
compared the system that affects the

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,860
price will be training system that

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:41,480
allows you to expect and muscles and

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,970
weak succeeded all right um can

00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,610
everybody hear me yeah so we've been

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,760
working on mobile topics in the plasma

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,280
team thing since 2009 and maybe some of

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,549
you remember the

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,920
and 900 and that was the first device we

00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:00,729
were running or we have been building a

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,740
plasma UI for that was a really really

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,950
early thing so we just tried to get

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,920
something running on the device also

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,539
didn't go very far and katie's and

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,790
especially plasmas ambitions really

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,730
started to soar when Nokia to call

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,989
repute and it was a period where many

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,640
things happen I'm not a lot of results

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,380
from that but it was certainly a good

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,450
learning period and it got Q to the

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,350
point where we would be very useful on

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,680
mobile devices when Nokia had same

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:36,120
vanished we started the plasma active

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,800
project and its goal was to release a

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,870
tablet with a novel do I well but

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,470
unfortunately it didn't work out so well

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:50,550
for various reasons but again we learned

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,459
about we learned a lot about the mobile

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:58,660
space that is to say outside of plasma

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:01,299
that's actually really big successes for

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,579
Katie first of all WebKit runs on 90

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:07,030
plus percent of all mobile devices today

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:10,329
and that came from Katie the telegraph

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,209
office suit runs on a shipped product

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,780
today that is the the jolla phone and

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,430
it's in the hand hands of users today

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,319
and of course we have very

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,390
frameworks which are becoming more and

00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:28,790
more successful and some of them are

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:31,250
also used on nano devices so what's our

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,849
efficient but typically really want to

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,040
achieve trainer is most importantly but

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,250
it's not just training we also wanted to

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,659
reach a point where everyone to use plus

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:47,689
the two different rows using

00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:50,930
everything's is to learn their lies we

00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:53,569
want to achieve a robot something that

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,019
is finished and polished we won't go to

00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:01,269
something that is we really say

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,620
inspector friends and at the same time

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,930
computers are for tinkering computers

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,530
are for tweaking we want to ensure that

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,090
this what we're working on is

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,260
customizable not just by us not just for

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:19,280
you the by everyone wants to join really

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,889
platform alright so let's let's get

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:27,740
right to the let's get right to the beef

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:30,760
instead of all talks let's look at what

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,710
we wear what we have created so far and

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,460
after that we will get you some more

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,490
information about how we've been doing

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,599
this stuff so smart phones this is

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,419
analogy Nexus 5 running a customized

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:50,120
plasma shell so it's the exact same

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:53,180
stack as we're using on the desktop but

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,220
you see it looks quite differently you

00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,620
can just just install some sparks

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:08,090
partner right today so in case you want

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:10,099
to give me a call you know not much demo

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,070
effect their but this is actually this

00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:16,220
has actually a working phone connection

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,710
so you can make and receive phone calls

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,250
with that

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,610
some of the stuff you see you know in

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,350
principle but they have gotten a mobile

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,950
UI these are the exact same

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,930
notifications so it's a nap fires

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,050
notification through the frameworks

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,150
notification API it will just work here

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,070
we'll get a different presentation

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,100
because it runs in a different form

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,210
factor but no changes in the apps for

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:50,780
this kind of functionality then we have

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,610
the plasma shell the launcher it's still

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,910
a fairly basic thing but you can already

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,840
change its look and feel you can

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,870
personalize it to a certain degree as

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,750
you might have guessed support plasmoids

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:12,140
of course again here's a different

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:15,760
mechanism customized for so the form

00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:19,640
factor gives a different user interface

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,390
for adding a widget and yes we had to do

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,730
a clock the point really is that the

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,860
work you've been putting into your

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,560
plasmid can be transferred almost

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,180
one-to-one to the new form factor in

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,940
some cases if you're making too many

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,370
assumptions about mouse and mouse overs

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,700
and that kind of stuff you would like to

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,640
change some code so as this course

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:51,230
that's not cool included k runner let's

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:53,330
go I really think this is the first time

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,300
that that has a mobile system that

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,690
shares so much code with the justice

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,330
system and many of the things here you

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,980
will actually recognize from the from

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,260
the desktop why that means two things

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,520
they work on a mobile device so all the

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,789
API is and everything

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:18,020
available they do adjust to a certain

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:20,449
level two different input methods but it

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,710
also means we haven't changed a lot and

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:26,870
really optimize them for the device and

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,180
we haven't been working for a very long

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,590
time on this but we got kind of a really

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,389
good kick start because there was

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,039
already so much functionality which we

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,710
could just take on the network

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,280
management which it took a few years to

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:46,900
implement well and we can tap into that

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:49,400
work those big out of plasma is the

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,300
ability to be able to customize it to

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:56,000
make it really yours we just showed some

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,069
things here I've seen the video a ton of

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,409
times already that I'm still dressed

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:08,000
with with you but it actually managed to

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:12,110
achieve what we see here is a settings

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,949
application which reuses KCM written in

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:18,860
qml so you write a QC akc em once and if

00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,169
it's if it's got a our responsive layout

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,039
you can just install it on the phone and

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,039
it'll work

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,029
and some third some of the modules will

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,190
actually recognize so again we gotta

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,680
kick start this the energy module which

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,029
is especially interesting on our mobile

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:45,260
device so you get really detailed

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:46,790
detailed information how cold some of

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,290
you might know about the application is

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,990
a new image here in gallery developed

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,570
entirely in qml and again here only

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,130
slightly our changes to make it suitable

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,040
for a smartphone device otherwise

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,600
completely the same code base start the

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,339
same application just on a different

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,339
device and it adapts itself

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,110
performance is really surprisingly good

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,700
because there's a soul

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,580
hardware-accelerated stuff discuss

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,890
through Wayland OpenGL and we can make

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,020
use of a very powerful hardware in the

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:43,410
phone we did also borrow a whole bunch

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,590
of apps is this for example the web

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:53,070
browser which is also used I'm going to

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:56,370
touch it works it's another one from

00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:00,180
from the winter touch project I weather

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,270
application it's one of the things that

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,310
don't we feel it's really important is

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:09,960
this is as to where every application is

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:14,160
welcome so of course good products run

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,670
they are really cute with you know TV

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,670
actor

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,500
yeah this is not using near this is

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,500
using Wayland

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,000
alright

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:45,649
we also included some time wasting

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:48,230
application and you know this is not my

00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:57,470
real score normally I scoring the nine

00:10:48,230 --> 00:11:11,329
hundred or thousand points so this is

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:23,959
the hard way and now to fight with me

00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:26,059
brah that's whatever alright so so

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,179
decided this project as a good systems

00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:31,220
internal project because we didn't put

00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,470
out we didn't want to put out take away

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,449
we wanted to get it to a point where we

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,639
could say yeah you know we can

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:39,889
technically make this work and we wanted

00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,980
to get it to a point where it's actually

00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,649
useful for other people to join in we

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,269
don't want you know to get presence of

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,160
oh yeah this is really cool so how good

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,589
how can I get my stuff running on it

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,769
yeah you know maybe wait a few months

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:58,160
we're still sorting out some deployment

00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:02,600
issues no um you can test your stuff

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,730
today if you have an LG Nexus 5 you can

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,490
just install and run it on it we also

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:13,249
have XO pc images and x86 packages so

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,089
you can test this stuff on your laptop

00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:17,689
and we

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:21,139
out with with deployment and testing on

00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:23,749
the phone um that said it was an

00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,360
internal project but last week I've

00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:28,819
moved all the code that is actually

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,059
special to the phone onto KDE

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:34,009
infrastructure will put this on Katie

00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:36,709
infrastructure we put this on there

00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,870
Katie government governance we really

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:42,199
want this to be an openly developed and

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:45,800
not corporate controlled project we also

00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,809
don't want this to look like well the

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,620
bus actus I've been a garage in between

00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:54,499
dives now we want this to be a

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:59,449
commercial high quality product this has

00:12:54,499 --> 00:13:01,339
to become a viable system that people

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,220
want to trust and out something that's

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,649
really honey that is to say if your

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,189
hobbies acting on software this is an

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:12,800
awesome target because it's all hoping

00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:14,629
also we feel that the wheels of free

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,480
software community and especially Katie

00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:20,559
we have the mandate to create software

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,660
that respects and enables your privacy

00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,360
Madeline said earlier that pretty much

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:30,529
caught in this do i want features and

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:35,749
shiny yeah i have to trade in some of my

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:38,509
privacy for that please don't we want to

00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:44,059
offer an alternative that respects your

00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:46,459
privacy and that allows you to to do

00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:51,079
with your data what you want independent

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:52,970
of the features also this thing is built

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,589
around too cute because we love cube

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:59,779
because we think you'd is the best

00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:01,640
solution to build applications for for

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,520
mobile devices and it also

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,550
really ties in with neutrons everywhere

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:14,120
and everything should be running on this

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:17,960
phone so the milestones we've reached

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,420
master one yes we have product than info

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,120
can restore and develops to work that's

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:27,500
where the user it works didn't you so

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:31,880
much hey what you can do with work and

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,390
next time today next step Doug Flutie

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,980
actually trying to use a day today for

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,960
technical and it's false users that's

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,540
something that we can all be developing

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,840
in the coming months then production

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:48,740
ready for really like audience a truly

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,200
useful and competitive product it's

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,630
really an additional and religious

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:59,960
country because that should be done is

00:14:53,630 --> 00:15:03,110
next year with that said there's a lot

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:07,010
of work ahead of us summarize where we

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,750
stand now this is not something you put

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,860
in the hands of your girlfriend if

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,970
you're interested in a long-term

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,550
relationship okay

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,569
don't do that don't give it to your

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,939
mother you should not be happy with it

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:23,459
you can try it though can have fun with

00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:25,680
it you can help us to make it good

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,000
enough for yourselves because we need to

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,120
make something good enough for ourselves

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,759
before we can make it good enough for

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,759
others it's already really a lot of fun

00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,670
to play with it stretches what we can do

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,509
with KD and it also stretches the scope

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:47,189
of KD it can really help us to get a new

00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:50,699
sense of relevance in the KDE project so

00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:53,220
what is do it runs colonel it boots

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,920
Michelle glass Marshall this is the same

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,259
binary that runs the desktop there's no

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,399
patching no code changes it just loads a

00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:04,439
different UI suitable for the phone as a

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,410
dialer it can make and receive phone

00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:09,600
calls you know some strange people still

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm actually expect that from

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,639
smartphones hello we're also using

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,040
software that we didn't do ourselves

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,040
with really tapping into other people's

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,170
resources we want this be a project

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,910
where things come together around then

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,490
where we're seeing a business was not

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,850
invented here so we're not doing it one

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,980
really good example is seem elite

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:39,329
virtual keyboard which is a very mature

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:43,470
thing the shipping on real real products

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:45,180
in the market today you could briefly

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,110
see it in the movie it actually got a

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,899
nice plasma skin so it integrates

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:54,080
visually very well and it's not

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,930
something we cobbled together

00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,620
just in one of Marcos sleepless nights

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,500
or something like that that's it we also

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,920
want to bring an existing functionality

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:10,250
so all the good stuff you know from the

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,980
desktop is transferred to the phone that

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:16,160
really gives us that head start in terms

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,010
of features you can do so so you've got

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,570
your terminal what else do you need yes

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:26,420
and it runs various applications so we

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:30,440
showed some applications in the in the

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,300
demo video but you know some people do

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,000
not take mobile phone platforms

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,150
seriously before they have passed the we

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,820
have 100,000 applications are running on

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,040
this how many applications are rated in

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,790
the country procedures must be more than

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,330
1,000 we are good we can run those we

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:53,240
have support for 4x applications so we

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,640
run wayland with X valent you can start

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,340
applications that haven't been ported to

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,050
wayland yet through the ex violence

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,450
stack of course you can it's a ubuntu

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:10,340
system I stabbed you in underneath you

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:12,160
can run debian software on it we also

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,510
went a little bit further and

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,900
implemented support for click

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,720
applications those are packaged

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,760
applications for to touch a weather

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,220
applet the weather application I was

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:29,600
showing earlier as an example for that

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:32,870
and that probably gets a generator of

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,650
100 thousand and one thing we are going

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:39,170
to definitely cross this this magic

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,059
boundary with this support for Android

00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,620
applications we are

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:47,299
on that right now and we expect that

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,299
within a few weeks months depending on

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:52,279
when we get some technical things sorted

00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:57,110
out you can run android applications on

00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:59,240
this and that means that you can give it

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,429
at some point to your girlfriend and

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,639
when she asks and I said what's that

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:07,129
message with it you can just run me up

00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:08,929
what's up Android application and it'll

00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:10,759
work if the Android that is quite

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:14,299
excited because this is going to be a

00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:16,129
completely open stack y'all are still

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:18,320
fish phones also support android apps

00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:20,330
that they use closed source components

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,360
for that and this will be 0 actually

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,730
will be open yes so y are you will be

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,950
run you will be able from android

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,830
applications not only on the plasma

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,869
phone but also on the plasma desktop and

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,230
that's one of the really really

00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:38,149
important things for us because we we're

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,340
not saying the desktop it's done now

00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:43,610
we're doing something something funny

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:47,299
new but we're adding the mobile platform

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:50,360
and you I to the plasma a phrase we are

00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:53,960
continuing to improve the desktop we

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,749
also want to make want to make a dent in

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,629
the mobile space and conquer these

00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:04,879
devices so technically the interesting

00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:07,789
dates we started out building a toner

00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:10,820
mer is basically those were a

00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:13,820
sufficiently strong it's not in their

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:19,340
system that uses way that

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:22,160
me neither because well this is mrs.

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,700
project we are going to good work space

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,510
and you to move on that blue to the mini

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,160
challenge really challenging to get

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:36,990
available

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:40,650
will access the stack because all three

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:43,440
are open and almond phone systems they

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,770
are nested Android and somehow it makes

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,130
arena Geminoid together in one way or

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,530
nother Houston re-discovery pirates so

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,770
we were really struggling to get this to

00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:00,300
work get a signal in adrenaline screen

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:03,510
until what investing said well how hard

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,310
can it actually is clearly and that's

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,180
the Netherlands to protect really

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:13,260
started fine what Quinn to the phone

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:16,170
started writing about in Paris and we

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,120
were actually getting graphics so what

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,520
what's one of the most exciting things

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,130
for me about insistence that we now have

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:36,930
a consciousness that runs quickly and

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:39,810
wait all right so let's see what are we

00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,190
going to do and why can we make a

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,710
difference because some people will say

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,590
yes there's mobile phones and those are

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,750
free enough in our opinion they are not

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,840
free enough you have to trade in your

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,110
privacy or even worse sell your soul to

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,780
to mobile vendors that's the reason for

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,000
us and that's the reason for for

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,280
hardware vendors and let me tell you

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,470
they are not happy with being under the

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,150
thumb of Google and getting source code

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,760
thrown over the wall every once in a

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:12,720
while we have an active development

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,330
community who produces software for end

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,420
users we have an awesome infrastructure

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,790
with our system means deeply caring to

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,310
make us productive we have a governance

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,770
model that is actually very suitable for

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,830
creating software and we have proven

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:31,830
that in 20

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:36,940
years of being a successful and reliable

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:39,610
maker of mainly desktop software we have

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,860
open and program development processes

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,809
we know how we work together effectively

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:50,350
we know how to get things fixed we know

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:52,510
how we can create processes that improve

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,429
the quality and that get our software

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,350
out of the users we don't have to

00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,720
reinvent the wheel the wheel in all

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,480
these supporting factors so we can

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:06,340
really concentrate on making good

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:10,450
software and doing so even in a fairly

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:12,220
short amount of time and most

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,929
importantly probably we have a proven

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,880
track record of being open and

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:22,929
respecting freedom if we put out

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:28,330
something like that we have a benefit an

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:31,029
advantage in trust already if we talk

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,889
about privacy we can do that do so with

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:41,100
a straight face if Google talks about

00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:46,210
privacy not so much so with that said

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,679
blue systems is working on this but we

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,769
don't want it to be a corporate control

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,480
project also we want to involve the

00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:55,269
light with the wider community because

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,659
it's fun and it's going to be rewarding

00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:01,630
and it's also very important project to

00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:05,380
work on both for Katie as a community

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:08,320
but also for the users who are right now

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,090
not really having options if they if

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,269
they need the privacy and it's not just

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,909
end users at home if we want journalists

00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:18,160
to be able to communicate in a secure

00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:21,370
manner to discover things

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,860
not have them be discovered by

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,600
governance and in this chasing game if

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,030
we want to enable the Snowden's and

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,550
Apple bums of this world you need this

00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:35,920
kind of platform we need you to help us

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:38,440
create this kind of platform and with

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,120
that I think we are coming to the crisis

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,120
part of this presentation

00:24:49,180 --> 00:25:05,420
in our best Spanish yes able to no

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:08,360
security model books patient I believe

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,850
make sure that and be kind of get to

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,930
track you anywhere will gps systems

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:18,830
integrator a lot of that depends on the

00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,540
application but we also have to admit

00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:24,620
we're very very early phase of this

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,630
project so we have no good answer to

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,720
that like for many other technical

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:33,260
issues as we said this is not ready for

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,600
emphasis yet and sandboxing of

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,500
applications is one of the topics we

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:51,560
need to work on it will also depend on

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:53,480
the time away from okay so not only in

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,010
the case because this building system

00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:02,000
what we've got is in it it is in it so

00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:05,900
you could try to use as he did its to do

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:13,300
a sanity or you try to cover me more but

00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:13,300
only exactly like it is basic system

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:53,510
no but very very good and important

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:57,110
point and things we know we have

00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:00,850
mentioned what we are presenting here is

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:03,580
a reference platform based on kubuntu

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:07,430
this is not a good one to only project

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:11,200
we want other distributions to create a

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:14,330
plasma mobile platform as well if you

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,760
want to get this to run on a phone

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,670
running fedora we are going to help you

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,190
we don't we don't want to create one

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,810
single distribution I think we want to

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,250
create a platform that you can run on

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,770
your mobile devices on the US on the OS

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:42,370
you want it Toronto and we will help you

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:42,370
to get that running to music

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:52,180
Aaron Sato kidding type in Cos Cob you

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,090
look on top of the pts vs converse with

00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:58,660
Helen and said available in canada etch

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:05,820
a very interesting not your kid the

00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:05,820
normals but can you text Iman Pete but

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:19,730
any word prophet of allah and other word

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:23,670
ecp succeed or not if not how do see

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,460
your work prescott well i'll see that

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:31,700
this time first question in the center

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,700
so that's countries were compared to

00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:52,790
enjoy alright so first of all this is

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,430
actually taken a lot of the code from

00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,410
which was also making up vb val d tablet

00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,900
this code has been ported to the

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,640
frameworks right this is not running x11

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,770
any more visits run in wayland so the

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,770
software stack is much much leaner and

00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:11,070
much much better than another important

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,230
difference to to the Plasmatics antibody

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:16,710
projects is that we have decent out

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:19,200
where it runs on today v plus my active

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,930
project was hampered by we couldn't get

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,690
it to run on a real arm device so you

00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:30,680
usually had to lug a lug around a nine

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:32,910
hundred gram tablet the phone said I

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,030
carried a lot less luggage to this

00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:40,680
Academy none to earlier academies that

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:42,240
makes a big difference and what is why

00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,040
don't we just say this one to touch

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,350
already and would find that well I think

00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,440
the past weeks have shown pretty well

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,750
that we will to touch is not exactly a

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,230
free and unencumbered platform its

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,220
corporate controlled and there are many

00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:02,820
questions around trade around trademarks

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:04,310
which may end up making it not much not

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,790
a much better option

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:10,250
android for many hardware vendors so we

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:14,300
do have something to to bring to the

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:17,660
table also if you compare how long it

00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:20,210
took canonical to get something running

00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,930
on a phone what kind of resources they

00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,430
put in and how long it took us you but

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:30,080
even though they have to get even a

00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:31,940
prototype are running let's interpolate

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,490
from this and that's meet again at

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,490
Academy 2016 and see where we stand okay

00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:56,360
we can do it works with question ability

00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:00,730
questions or first one is hopefully very

00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,730
circles we said that you still

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:20,940
yes yes absolutely oh yeah so at this

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:23,990
diagram which I let let me not pull it

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:31,860
up right now it's to save some time for

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:34,830
so Quinn uses on this device lip Hybris

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,620
to get the graphics on screen but it's

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:41,130
it's clean it has a back end for DRM so

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,500
you can use any other drivers and simple

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:48,150
place actually also runs might happen so

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:50,310
we hidden this difference neatly away

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,950
yes we don't have a free to graphics

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:57,420
right before our reference device yes we

00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:05,130
want to do Oh does experts all second

00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:09,080
question is maybe this jerrica project

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,080
and some features

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:47,610
you can share across network so it may

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,330
be able to read your mind that probably

00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:53,580
won't send this data to random services

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,350
ah yes the use cases you are talking

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,580
about we have worked on them so far

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:04,320
we've been concentrating on getting the

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:09,240
basics to work definitely want to turn

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,730
this into a device that depending on the

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,410
use case you run it on but probably for

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,230
the plasma case much more important is

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:19,980
you usually start something on a device

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:23,250
on the device doesn't change so it's not

00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,380
critical right now to have it morph into

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,870
something different if you pluck some

00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,390
plug something in word with a plasma

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,270
architecture this has been planned from

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:36,110
day one so it's fairly easy to support

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,110
staff use cases

00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,379
their own enemies

00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,240
