Title: Sanjiban Bairagya - Interactive Tours in Marble - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Tours in Marble are a set of related places with supporting media, by which you can take a virtual tour of the world, and are visited in a defined timeline, which can be played back, and are useful for a range of tasks, like highlighting places of interest for sightseeing, or taking a trip of the highest skyscrapers of the world. My talk will be on the "Interactive tours" feature in Marble, and how to use, edit, create, view and record it.

Touring is a concept in virtual globes by which the user is able to take a virtual trip around places across the globe, where the camera viewpoint flies from location to location, maybe waiting at some points, or playing a background music or an event sound at some time durations, also while making smooth changes in the balloon style or color in the tour along the way. The use cases can be very dynamic.
My talk is mainly going to focus on almost everything that can be done using the "Interactive Tours" feature in Marble, in as little time as possible. This includes:
1. Describing "items" that make up a kml tour, namely, FlyTo, Wait, SoundCue, TourControl, and AnimatedUpdate items.
2. Introducing the Tour Widget, where all the actions take place, the playlist where new items can be added, deleted, or edited in-place.
3. The Tour-playback, and also how we can drag the progress-bar to fast-forward the playback and vice-versa.
4. How one can view a route as a tour using the "View route as tour" feature of Marble.
5. How one can create a video file of a tour, in different video formats, in the background, without having to record it in the usual way of playing the tour and then using the "Record Movie" option.

	00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:12,599
hi everyone

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,210
today I am going to talk about marble

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:19,919
marble ISM virtual globe so last year in

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,680
my google summer of code project i

00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,869
implemented a new thing called

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,500
interactive feature interactive tools in

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,500
module so i am going to talk about it so

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:35,970
this is my agenda so first of all what

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,210
are tools like inverter globes

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,059
previously we had like navigation like

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,570
you can see the route from one point to

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,610
another we can view it and many things

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,650
but touring is something different it's

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,739
like suppose you want to take a tour of

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:56,510
the top 10 highest scratch skyscrapers

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,729
in the word in your own way in that case

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,070
basically you want to take a tour of the

00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,680
entire globe like a global move in the

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,040
way you want and accordingly you will

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,650
get to see the like top 10 skyscrapers

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,619
in that case towards are important so

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,659
these are a few things which foods can

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:21,600
do and few in case you can see here

00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:24,240
after that so basically to those tours

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,549
are nothing but KML files which contain

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,490
a playlist with different types of

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,249
elements like their side two elements by

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,280
which you can go to a location or wait

00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,749
elements and sound cue elements by which

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,229
you can play some music in the

00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:42,479
background if I had my laptop I could

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:48,899
have like crazier tour from the spot and

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:53,340
short but I don't know so yeah so so you

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,889
have cereal cereal tracks and parallel

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,829
tracks here tracks are those which like

00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:01,530
slide elements exterior tracks because

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,920
you can slide to opposition only after

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,780
the previous point has been covered

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,580
similarly weight elements

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,800
if there is a wait element of five

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,860
seconds then you wait at a position for

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,230
five seconds so these are serial cracks

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,450
and panel tracks are animated animated

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,940
updates and sound cues which can happen

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,650
in Italian in the background or does not

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,160
depend on whether the previous one is

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,850
are done and this basically gives an

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,010
idea like if suppose suppose there is

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,850
the slight to happening and then the

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,739
next fri place has started then you can

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,709
have even start to sound cue at that

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,590
moment and it can again keep going on

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,900
since the next pause has started so

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,170
basically it makes no sense if you don't

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,390
watch a video of the tool but you can

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,560
try it out in your marvelous gesture

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,690
when you get time and this is basically

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,780
what a playlist looks like this is it

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,860
tour visit and you can after creating

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,720
you can edit edit using those buttons

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:14,070
adjacent where if every element and

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:17,670
that's the bar so the two playback can

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:22,260
be moved seek left or right and you can

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,660
even increase the speed and all so apart

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,459
from that you can also view a route as a

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:32,760
food so if you suppose you want our road

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,760
between barcelona and madrid you find it

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,239
and you can you hit up a button called

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,570
preview route and you did basically it

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,850
plays a video where it goes through the

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,500
route and expose it as a code and the

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,260
waypoints swap accordingly and thats how

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,730
it looks like and apart from that you

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,069
can also create a video of the tour

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,620
without having to do it manually you

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,510
just it you just have to this there is

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,349
an option if you click on it it will

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,000
just create a data mp4 or avi whatever

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,239
format you want in the background while

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,420
you can work on it and then stop it so

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,549
that's all if you want to join the

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,880
community you can the official site is

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,560
monitored k d dot or the experience has

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,380
marble and amazingness is more than

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,380
doubled at direct of KD 2 okay thanks

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,540
