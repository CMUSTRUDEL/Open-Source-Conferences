Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	The Ring team (renamed from SFLphone) recently released Ring 2.0.0. This new major version implement distributed and secured peer to peer communication. This talk introduce the software and highlight the challenges and advantages of using platform native GUI on top of a common QtCore library.

The Ring team (renamed from SFLphone) recently released Ring 2.0.0. This new major version implement distributed and secured peer to peer communication. This talk have 3 parts

Part 1:
An introduction to the Ring project, our features, vision and mission.

Part 2:
Ring 2.0.0 use native (QWidget, QML, GTK, Cocoa and Android) GUI on top of a common QtCore based business library. This is achieved extensive use of Qt Model/View and new Qt5/C++11 capabilities. This section will highlight the challenges, advantages and disadvantages of using Qt in the backend.

Part 3:
An introduction to Ring distributed communication infrastructure, how security is handled and the challenges of staying standard compliant when implementing new capabilities.

	00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,340
good morning everybody welcome to the

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,240
stock my name is Emmanuel I'm from

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,360
Montreal and I've been working on the

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,770
ring ring was called the SFL phone at

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,660
some point we rename it last year

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,150
sponsored bar by some so Alex in

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,390
Montreal which is a free software

00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:45,090
service company I've been working on it

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:47,010
since 2009 ring is used to be a boy why

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,739
pay phone so you could make calls over

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:57,570
the internet it's using open standards

00:00:49,739 --> 00:01:00,420
such as Sid TLS s RTP RTP x509 and as

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,940
much Oakland the standards as we can so

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,320
we're enteral parable with much of the

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,680
existing Internet voice-over-ip

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,350
frameworks such as a steric Cisco

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,260
priests which most of the phones you

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,939
have at your office can actually talk

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:23,310
with ring and you can replace them with

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:26,790
rings to have a softphone we say we use

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,700
a lot of open technologies some of them

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,619
are shared with web browsers some of

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:38,460
them are specific to Internet telephony

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:40,920
as a feature set we have voice calls

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,670
text messaging and video calls transfer

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,380
old and roll record sip account

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,000
peer-to-peer account which is new in the

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,969
ring the student zero would talk about

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,060
it later and we have Mills account and

00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:57,479
musical support so everything call

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:03,450
center or generic user needs we usually

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:05,729
implemented ring 20 is more and more

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,740
competitive skypes so we're implementing

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,840
several less our architecture so you

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,320
just have to have a private key and a

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,940
public key and that's enough to actually

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,880
call someone you can someone there

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:22,540
directly using its public key so it's a

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:26,530
fully encrypted an SSH like Network

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:31,550
the project story started in 2004 as a

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:33,650
handed demon for embedded devices not

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,260
much later there was a GD key client in

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:41,960
a cutie client cute client that was were

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:44,360
built in the 2008 the cube cube client

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,400
was dropped and replaced by a kiedy for

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:52,430
client in 2009 when took over I splenda

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,760
client in two parts which is a business

00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:01,190
logic libraries and the kitty dial

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,590
itself later on the whole gtk client

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,260
died and every clients such as the new

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,980
num 1 OS x and windows are not built on

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:13,640
top of the QT business library that was

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,560
used by the Khedive for client which

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,030
isn't which what's interesting about

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:23,120
hated every you I have a Nazi if you re

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,370
so did not fly in g decatur OSX client

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,990
is using the coop but they're built on

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:35,600
top of your cute switch as I as far as I

00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:38,020
know the first so we have this sure

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,760
library at the center of the project and

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:45,140
if Ronettes of client is built on it and

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:51,550
on under its come on libraries such as

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:53,780
Libya VFF mpegs stuff you use every day

00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:59,420
skip done because we don't have much

00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:02,930
time the architecture itself is fully

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,790
built using a state machines so you have

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,560
events coming from the networks and

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,470
events coming from the users and those

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,750
heavens are then passing to state

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,450
machines so the whole application itself

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,760
is an automaton which make it much

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,730
easier to build third-party clients on

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,130
top of the library because the whole

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:26,169
library state will always be

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:29,210
synchronized with the client network

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,500
passing a call for example you will have

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,700
a series of states that will

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,880
and until the call is over sending for

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:43,140
text messaging and stuff I doubt the

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,230
library's based on the Qt models so we

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:51,930
have like this is a whole but we now

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:55,620
have like 70 somethings models use in

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:59,810
the library which hello has to have very

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:04,050
very easy time to build new clients for

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:09,870
embedded specific use case or for new

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:12,450
platforms this goes on and on the models

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:16,250
themselves will take data from various

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:18,810
sources such as a network such as upnp

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:23,790
your history your contacts from a

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:27,180
kennedy and really a lot of sources than

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:30,419
will format this data and put it in the

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,419
models I guess everybody here is the

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:39,169
custom to doing that will also indulge

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:43,050
security very well so we have the whole

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:46,550
certificate change validation and every

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:51,690
part of your assets such as coal and

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:54,120
accounts are always very dated against

00:05:51,690 --> 00:06:00,200
security validation model which Allah

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:09,540
has to in real time be aware of security

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:12,479
issues if you weren't went to the Devon

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:16,290
talk yesterday you heard about the stock

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,229
exchange models which were used with

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,270
various sources and combination of all

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,910
models to have a real-time navigation

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,400
this is exactly what we use in the

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,760
background so you have a pipe lines of

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,160
various models going to proxies and

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,249
filtering them formatting them and at

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,859
the end you have a combination model

00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:38,839
and the whole validation will take place

00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:41,209
on the data of this model in real time

00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,449
which otherwise to other ways at any

00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:51,499
point you be able to know the security

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:56,349
over assets as I said earlier the other

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:59,899
clients such as the gtk and OS X 1 use

00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:04,669
native UI because the maintainer czar

00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:09,349
the client wanted that dick began why me

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:13,399
why not and so as the library who's cute

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:16,309
we had some interesting chances to make

00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:22,939
this work so the first one was of course

00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:25,969
singing onslaught as you know in the QT

00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:29,119
4 era those were using some strange

00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:32,509
string manipulation in the background to

00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:34,849
connect but in the acute 5 what you have

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,689
is you have function pointers so all of

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:41,659
a sudden the gtk and the QT if seen

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,089
Ellen slots mechanism just became

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:48,439
compatible same thing for the event loop

00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:52,279
since cute for that something could use

00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:56,059
the Dylan so in the background it just

00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:59,929
no work the models that was quite

00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:04,849
surprising also bind very fine on both

00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:08,329
the gtk cute kitty and OS X without too

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:11,269
much code and in the end it was just

00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:14,149
binding the similar api's together and

00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:18,639
the things just started showing up and

00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:22,759
working which is surprising in fact but

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,779
it is really just what we expected to

00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,159
have issues with this but we never had

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:32,680
transaction horan load is in a state

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:35,329
machines so we are very his time

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,250
transferring data from the client to the

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:41,310
library to the demon and just work

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,280
the main problem was actually the bus on

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:48,150
lonex we use the bus to communicate

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,090
between the clients and the demon on OSX

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:54,630
and windows we don't have that so the

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:57,600
thing is was to use the xml file from

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:01,320
the day bus interface and generate C++

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,620
code to bind both part directly and all

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,170
of a sudden with after a while started

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,830
working in two hours like interesting so

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,880
now we use d bus on the linux and we use

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:18,120
a net see blinking on OSX and windows

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:23,210
which was a fear that wouldn't work also

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,920
until five introduced in QT core the

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:29,250
queue item selection model class it used

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,590
to be in a queue DUI this allows has to

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,230
really buy every widgets of all

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,750
platforms Asajj combo box and list view

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,570
table view three views and be able to

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,940
link the selection from the native

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,510
client directly into the state machines

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:50,850
and this is really the key to building

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:53,520
many you I with many types of widgets

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:58,230
set on many platforms because ounce you

00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,380
have section models and views Biden then

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,720
you are 0 0 red coat so no matter who me

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,120
platforms you have to support in fact

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,690
they're just in clients with knowledge

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,830
in code is binding directly to the

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:16,110
underlying business library to under the

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:20,010
problem word from platforms have a

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,990
different contact systems such as key de

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,790
la Kennedy and some other blood from

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:28,950
down we actually have a mirror or the

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,560
collection class whichever platform

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,720
connect

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,210
on top of key de of course just binding

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,610
directly to a committee but on the other

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,940
platforms they're just using a similar

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:44,040
API binding them so in the end we have

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,040
working clients for platforms

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,290
ring this is a rinky d which is a of

00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,380
course CD client so you have your

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:05,670
contacts your bookmarks your history and

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,920
you can pass house you are the

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,830
completions which is provided by the

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,920
business liar and you can configure a

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,780
lot of assets if you look at the assets

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,660
you will see that there is a lot of

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,570
collections which are not from a kinetic

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,810
surely because we know that we have an

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,870
abstract API for that internally we can

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,630
just use this for everything so there is

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,970
story the contacts the recording the

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,250
profiles which is the stuff you share

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:39,150
when you call someone and the ringtones

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:41,820
which we looked at at beginning of

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,250
moving those assets into a vanity itself

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,520
but at the end of the kiddie for a ride

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:51,390
was not so the time to do this anymore

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,160
so we decide for now to go and with our

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,730
own solution at some point in the future

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,860
we might move them back to a kannadi on

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:07,940
the new generation is out and everything

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:07,940
but for now it's a pictures there so

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,760
this is about it I just get so many

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:23,450
parts to save time it's actually

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:23,450
finished early do you have any questions

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:39,720
okay inside and use I soap on the

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,140
diagram and I'm going to try to like no

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,140
fighting

00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:02,590
there we go we have since 2012 android

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:06,940
client however it's not using the QT

00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:10,300
part the cute part yet so for now it's

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:14,230
not officially released until get ported

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:17,860
or managed to get the features the other

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,560
clients have because what what having a

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,600
common business liar allowed us is to

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,290
have multiple clients with a similar

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,460
feature set back then when we had a GD k

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,460
in a kiddie client the kiddie client was

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,160
getting new features every weeks and

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,990
what the GT key client because it's C

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,380
and some time doing more advanced

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:45,910
features in silly require a lot more

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,490
time was a falling behind so when when

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,490
we decide to use the the cute library a

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,880
liberal client we call it to share the

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,360
whole business that helped us in a few

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,600
weeks to have five new clients but the

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,820
Android wants because it's Java there is

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,350
a whole new set of challenges because

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,990
the maintainer want to use native

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:12,970
widgets he can and there were those are

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,860
accessible only from Java you have to

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:21,760
create a GN I binding so cutie cute five

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,180
doesn't yet have Jambi so it's not

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,580
possible to directly unless Jambi gets

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,980
bored and directly access the library

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:34,180
from the Java side there is some

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,820
attempts on the web to port Jambi 285

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,010
and android but it's not advancing

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,570
really well there's not a lot of people

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,570
wanting to do that in the first place

00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:53,079
thank you so much

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,829
