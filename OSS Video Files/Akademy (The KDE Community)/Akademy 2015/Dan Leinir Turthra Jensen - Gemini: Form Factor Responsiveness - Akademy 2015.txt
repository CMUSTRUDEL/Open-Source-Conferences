Title: Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen - Gemini: Form Factor Responsiveness - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Gemini is a concept in applications which allows them to switch between distinctly different experiences depending on the form factor your device is in at any particular time. See a Gemini style application in action, and see what you need to do it with your own application.

A number of years ago, a small company named Always Innovating created devices which could switch form factor at runtime. Since then, this has become popular in a number of places, but one issue is still the awkwardness of applications, which tend to work well in one particular mode, but not very well in others.

Enter Gemini, a concept in application design which allows for the construction of applications which can change their entire operational mode to fit on these devices, in which ever mode they happen to be in.

During this presentation, and based on the work done in cooperation between Intel and now unfortunately defunct KO GmbH on the Calligra office suite, during this presentation, the concept is described through presenting Calligra Gemini, and you are given an introduction into how you can do this with your own applications.
