and well first of all I want to beg your

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,730
pardon because English is beautiful I

00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:25,450
to agree to speak the more clear than i

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:29,170
can let me introduce myself put us in go

00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:32,560
say I'm bugs ortega talked about talking

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:36,910
in the world you can form a list is

00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:41,500
named I will be nice but this is not

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:45,220
important for this talk I'm feature of

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,699
secondary level I teach physics science

00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:52,899
tennis to students for close to 16 GS

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:58,949
all I can say it's not easy it's not

00:00:52,899 --> 00:01:03,940
easy this is important because I think

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:09,430
trying to speak physics to the students

00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:13,480
helped me to try to play me well and

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:17,550
this is important for my work for the

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:22,180
feast of water I am teacher of the

00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:25,960
University College una is a Vista

00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:34,479
University of Spain but this is not

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:39,490
important the most important for me is I

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:46,469
think this talk is that I am a simple

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:52,770
user I don't know nothing about running

00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:57,369
out developer I when I say black stream

00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:03,399

00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:12,020
to

00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:14,870
so my story starts in twenty seven when

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,750

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,560

00:02:47,750 --> 00:03:00,220

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:07,580

spinning webs reading house to bring to

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:36,220

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,550
disciplined remember well i started to

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,800
jump with plenty of all happiness

00:03:52,550 --> 00:04:04,489
because i can finally have a linux in my

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:09,950
computer it was in 27 so i started to

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:13,880
learn a soft freeze over I i start i

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,910

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:21,170
them

in love i love this forward it's

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:43,650
fantastic is pebbles I was happy but I

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,220
started eating why the people are all we

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:52,080

00:04:47,220 --> 00:05:00,800
use chili why don't we use you and I

00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:04,590
stock thing why I can use leaves but I

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,280
think for both to whistle because I

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:13,400
can't use linux the first of all is that

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:18,450
I have coricidin I try to make a jump I

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:22,580
have knowledge of computers I can do it

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:28,080
because i can bring english i can

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:32,220
understand the developers little and

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:38,930
finally I can

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:44,760
so high I and I have some knowledge of

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:47,790
English I'm not willing but the people

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,980
around me don't have knowledge of

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:56,340
computers and they kind with anything

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:59,700
degrees for my level over to a developer

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:04,200
because there is a little problem but I

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:10,410
found in that moment when i read a blog

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:15,150
or a post or tutorial raha do this

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:18,990
document is was made from developer to

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:23,460
developer and they told in advertiser

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:29,220
language it's difficult to an simple

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:34,080
users to understand what they have to so

I have free time in the moving and so

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:43,680

it's it was great organize an event like

00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:02,260
academies with our seating between us is

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:07,329
in flavor another thing that I want I

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:10,949
travel mode because I have a positive i

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:15,790
want to go to the developer go to yoga I

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:20,589
can travel to flag to make a little

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:26,380
speech it was five fabulous and I think

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:35,640
I sorry I think there must be no things

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:39,720
that I want a faculty never well

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:45,960
as you see i am a simple user the do a

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:53,300
lot of things but i feel that i am not

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:57,150
particularly meant i am only a simple

00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:00,780
now i can teach surface over for a

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:08,850
reward but everybody can eat three so

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:11,820
far everyone with overly are callie

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:16,740
kiele committing such community of

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:22,290
developers within developers to make to

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:27,270
make a good job work but underneath

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:30,590
latest with sinus the packages put it a

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:40,700
lot of people doing a lot of things but

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:46,000
he came all we need now is users etoys

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:51,220
Fenway is using our software probably

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,960
that a way you need it most we need our

00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:03,710
users speaking about our software

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:08,080
because it's difficult to use simple

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:12,890
users to understand developers I think

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:19,700
the people who can say users currently

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:24,880
files have another users so what can we

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:30,230
do well we can go to one simple thing is

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:33,200
to choose the people around you that our

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:37,250
users and I'm sure that a lot of people

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:45,920
around you stutters and users to help

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:52,990
our community which way all the ways for

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:59,440
the voices follow a TD social network or

00:19:52,990 --> 00:20:05,930
blogging or assisting conference

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:08,990
everyone because i think the juices the

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:14,140
simple users have the opportunity to

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:21,320
communicate very well to another people

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:24,260
what its finish it I think I respect you

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,360
can understand me I pick you out another

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:33,460
way another time person because my

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,460
English is not very good but that's all

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:44,060
innovation shoulders it slowly please

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:55,870
you are teaching with the world and you

00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:58,840
have a physics teacher I am fishing each

00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:04,140
other did you try to use this over with

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:08,620
class yes I use for example calcium

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:14,590
who's playing chemist and I try to use

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:19,299
step in physical but the most important

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:24,490
is that my students see my laptop with

00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:28,090
free software and and they asked about

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:31,960
up cottages because this is not the

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:36,130
thing I have in my house because we are

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,730
also promoting with summer schools so

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,650
maybe later with the changes or

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:46,480
experienced surgeon can understand

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:49,360
because we are also promoting resour in

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,940
schools yes so later after recession

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,440
maybe we can change some or experience

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,440

are you actually changing for the

00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:27,179
experience it's about the vodka the

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:30,719
quality of free software or how to come

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,629
Katie users or how to come Katie they

00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:38,999
