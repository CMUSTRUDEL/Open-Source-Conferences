Title: Kevin Ottens - Do As I Say, Not As I Do: Or is it the Other Way Around? - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	This short talk will be a follow up on last year craftsmanship talks. Indeed, it is too easy to lecture people on how to do or not to do something... there must be another, darker side, to this story. Don't be afraid, we'll explore it together, you won't be alone in the dark.

Last year we gave craftsmanship advices spanning from testing, to CI use going through architecture. But do they all work for real? Are there rules we broke in the Zanshin project? Why and when?

In this short talk we'll point out everything we did or we are doing wrong in Zanshin as a counterpoint. This way we can come clean and show how naughty we are as well and how we try to treat ourselves.
