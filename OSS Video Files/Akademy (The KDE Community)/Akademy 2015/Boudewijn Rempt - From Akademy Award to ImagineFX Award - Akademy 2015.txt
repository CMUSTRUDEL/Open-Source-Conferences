Title: Boudewijn Rempt - From Akademy Award to ImagineFX Award - Akademy 2015

Description: 
	The Krita project has grown enormously since 2015. From a dozen to tens of thousands of users, from KDE's answer to Gimp to a serious alternative to Corel Painter and Photoshop for professional artists in the commercial world. This presentation is part a retrospective of the steps we took to get here, part a presentatio of our plans for the future!

When Krita received the Akademy Award for Best Application in 2006 (https://dot.kde.org/2006/09/25/akademy-award-winners), we were all very pleased and honoured. And it showed great foresight on the part of the jury!

But, honestly, Krita back then was a small hobby project with maybe a dozen or so of users. We had no real focus beyond being KDE's answer to Gimp, either. And the port to Qt4 then took ages.

A slow decline seems to be the most likely future for Krita. Had the Akademy Award jury made a mistake?

Almost ten years later, Krita's userbase is expanding beyond our wildest imagination. Professional artists from all around the world use Krita for their work. Krita is used by artists working on Hollywood movies, games played by millions of people, board games, illustrations, children's books.

How we got this far is a big tale and may inspire other projects, too, to reach out and bring their work into the wide world.
