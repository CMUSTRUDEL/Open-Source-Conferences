	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,680
so hybrid we are the financial working

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:15,719
group actually two of us are lathering

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:17,580
new to these I mean Danny Lee so these

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,590
are the members that are currently

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:26,099
active in the group its Daniella David

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:29,060
Roman I K me and Marta was not here now

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,320
a few words about our mission and goals

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,040
one of the basic things that the

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,290
Financial Corp working group is aiming

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,149
at is supporting the kirov or evey board

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,480
on all the things I have to do with

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,660
financial issues we we work together

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,230
with the treasurer to propose financial

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:53,129
decisions to the KTV port and tide to

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,440
move things forward in terms of that we

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,120
try to support the board members in

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,590
everything that has to do with various

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,039
commercial activities that we are

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,680
engaged in as a community and as any as

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,810
the VI organization and we also support

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,549
the treasurer in communication actions

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,130
related to financial topics so we tried

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,140
to evaluate evaluate the financial

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,140
reports in a regular manner that are

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,890
done by the treasurer and in general we

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,750
try to help the community

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:29,759
implement the annual budget that we all

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,509
decided together so so someone else want

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,509
to pick that from

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,940
yeah and part of our work is doing the

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:46,600
budget plan or drafting it and yes of

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,670
the treasurer which is I care he has an

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,340
initial draft and presented to us and

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,390
then we suggest changes to it like

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:58,690
paraphrasing or expanding the goals but

00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:03,540
our heart of budget and risk analysis on

00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:06,250
what it means to spend as much and yeah

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:13,480
you're gonna see the playing later all

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:15,550
right all right a couple of months ago

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,420
the financial working group convened

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,760
with the new members to review the

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,880
budget plan that we did late last year

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,900
for the year of 2019 and check out how

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:33,150
we're doing we were looking at how

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,150
Academy was coming along at the time and

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,650
thanks to our wonderful sponsors

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,239
expected income was actually exceeded

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,450
and this conference is quite well

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,019
sponsored this year thank you so much it

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,959
was a bit more expensive than last year

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:57,130
but we projected that in advance as well

00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,280
at the time when we did the budget plan

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,769
we had trouble finding a location so

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,870
we're preparing the budget for having to

00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,940
rent a venue we didn't have to do it in

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,350
the end however Milan especially around

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,530
this time of year is a relatively

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,570
expensive city to hold an event in so we

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,450
ended up needing that increased budget

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:19,840
but right on the mark so no problems

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,330
there we did have money and do still

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,040
have money allocated for our satellite

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,739
events Academy and confidant catered in

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,170
l'acadÃ©mie recently submitted their

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,019
budget to us which is again right on the

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,390
mark of the overall V budget plan and

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,360
the money allocated for them so that

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,459
looks quite good the money for

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,220
constructed in still ready and available

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,440
by the time portion fines as a venue and

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,440
we still look forward to that happening

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,680
we have budget allocated for the next

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,580
step in the documentation writer

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,620
projects that money is available we need

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,290
to put the work into putting another job

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,840
ad out with the help of Juan Carlos

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,140
hopefully and moving that to the

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,220
membership getting it out there and

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,170
contracting somebody for a longer

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,590
follow-up project based on the results

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,570
of the pilot project I mentioned before

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,820
so I won't go into too much detail that

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,240
we're trying to improve our CV cm

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,840
installation related ork we had budget

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,990
allocated for contracting that work so

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,290
far the expenses track what we allocated

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,380
for that we have no plans for

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,560
fundraising campaigns so far to our

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,169
knowledge the fundraising working group

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,590
might illuminate that further the budget

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:54,680
plan was conceived with an eye towards

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:56,930
not needing them so that's fine and we

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,400
did have budget allocated for 2019 for

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,440
putting on the Rhondda event in

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,840
Switzerland again as I mentioned however

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,840
this event could not happen to see her

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,229
due to the venue in Switzerland not

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,020
being available instead what came along

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,840
is hosting a co-hosting Linux

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,820
application summit with Nome the budget

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,930
needed for that sort of neatly slots

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,880
into what we had allocated for Rhonda so

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,370
that worked out well so far our budget

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,520
plan has proven to be quite accurate

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,400
the only problem in there is that we had

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,310
quite a lot of money allocated for the

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,310
gold to spend which not so much progress

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,520
has been made on so if you find somebody

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:46,430
involved with this we call selected in

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:49,900
2017 tell them to spend money and you

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,169
just tell them to spend money please and

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,169
how about you

00:05:54,469 --> 00:06:04,809
so we when we out will help sorry we had

00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:16,369
preparing the financial part of the KDE

00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:18,619
2019 and another report and sorry so as

00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:21,349
alluded to in the board reports once a

00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:24,259
year we publish a large report on what a

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:27,349
KDE community and KETV has been up to in

00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,719
the preceding year this just got done

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:32,149
for 2018 the link was and the Balt

00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:36,889
report will go out on our social media

00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:39,469
and dot k d dot org soon it's once again

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,860
a very large publication a lot of things

00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:44,269
happen in 2018 that are worth reporting

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,969
the financial working group is tasked

00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:51,349
with providing financial information for

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:52,479
that report this was once again way more

00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:56,839
difficult and it should have been

00:06:52,479 --> 00:07:00,649
because our accountants did not give us

00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,509
the annual overview in time that's sort

00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:05,569
of an organizational issue that we fit

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,339
before and we need to work with them

00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:08,619
more closely to make sure those time

00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:12,139
tables align better

00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:14,659
there has been some personnel turnover

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,929
on the side of the accountants offers

00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:26,809
and we need to sort of strengthen that

00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:31,459
relationship in the coming year okay so

00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:34,969
various money allocated for the KDE dot

00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:37,969
orc website because there was so long

00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:43,129
nobody working on it and it was in kind

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:47,029
of a bad state and so this changed in

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:51,429
the last half year mainly thanks to Carl

00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:54,559
as far as I know and Jonathan Hatton on

00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:57,439
working on it so there's now a question

00:07:54,559 --> 00:08:03,129
what to do with these funds can we say

00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:04,889
all matters or okay I think it's 30,000

00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:10,289
euros

00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:12,810
okay yeah so the question is not what to

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:15,810
do with it and if you have good ideas I

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,810
talked to Carl about it already like I

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:23,039
find I personally find it kind of silly

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,800
to now after he has done the verb to say

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,409
hey know that you were f done with work

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,699
we don't need to spend it anymore so

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:33,089
there's also the question with how to

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:37,019
hire contractors or all this is still a

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:39,209
little bit up in the air so I think we

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,649
discussed it internally already but I

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,849
think it should go to the wider

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,149
community too

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,459
in general the question of how to with

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,970
contracting and in this particular

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:54,120
instance of bet of our website we want

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,750
to talk at the website both on Tuesday

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,649
is the Tuesday about it so if you have

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,630
ideas or if you are interested in the

00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,390
website come there and we will be there

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:10,040
or I at least some of you may be as well

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,040
talk about it yeah

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,899
so we received a load of money has been

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,050
earmarked for a specific project on

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,330
Caligula the one with big funds and we

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,529
now have to work out how we go about

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,930
using up money

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,000
we have decided 10% to just go straight

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,190
to creature because Crete is active it

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,440
doesn't have a discussion of what part

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,000
of League were to give it to but as some

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,709
lawyer and financial stuff which is

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,770
complicated and I don't understand

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:44,380
but it means Eevee has to deal with

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:52,540
handling out which we're still slowly in

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:54,490
the process of doing well what we came

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:59,200
up together with the critter foundation

00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:02,080
to do is that they of course mostly

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,850
exist I guess to receive money on behalf

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,709
of the creature community and put that

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:11,640
money towards development of the critter

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:15,010
application they also were looking into

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,570
hiring somebody to help with the

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,600
documentation and and sort of user

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,520
support efforts and one way for us to

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,250
spend that money earmarked for them

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,579
would be to hire this person as the KTV

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,820
instead and manage that money separately

00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:32,260
and use it to pay that person this is

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,000
something that the creative foundation

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,260
is happy with this is something that the

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
financial working group is happy with

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,630
and it might well happen in the coming

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,630
year

00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:03,560
yeah yeah okay so as part of adopting

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,720
further the matrix solution set up a

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,630
group on matrix in order to improve our

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,550
collaboration realized that we didn't

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,410
have a tool for direct communication we

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,320
only discuss at least in the past

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,660
through mainly so this is an attempt to

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,790
try to get the financial working group

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:29,540
working more actively together to more

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:33,830
direct ways let's say graphs everybody

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:38,240
loves them money money money money money

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,910
oh my God look at amount of money and

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,500
this is mostly all down to I care who

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,970
really deserves a big round of applause

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,970
for dark big column

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:54,600
that sounded less inappropriate in my

00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:57,060
head but now it's to be noted that some

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,240
of this allocate fun some of these funds

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,210
is for an allocated project so it's not

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,670
all just to spend on whatever we like

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:13,140
but so it can't all be spent on beer

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:14,490
only up to here our which point I can't

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,560
reach it and we'd have to get Volk at

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:22,590
the point and here comes a problem our

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,490
expenses are still down here where I can

00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,140
reach just and that is a problem that

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,030
needs to be fixed and we do need to

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,160
spend money which is an odd thing to be

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:34,560
saying normally financial groups tell

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,570
people to not waste money and don't

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,390
waste money but we do need to spend that

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,340
we do need to use it and certainly in a

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:47,160
DM tomorrow we need to be really

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:57,960
discussing fixing us fixing it any

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:59,880
useful way vodka Hey oh well yet david

00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,180
says earthquake correctly we're

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,550
nonprofit we are obligated to put our

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,990
resources towards the goals of the

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:16,040
organization and the purpose of the

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:16,040
organization right

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:24,040
right so um this is excellent point if

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,950
you look at the budget plan the way we

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,500
drew up the budget plan was to say okay

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,589
we're going to considerably increase our

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,870
expenses we're going to forego the

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:38,740
fundraising campaigns and in the past

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,180
instead we want in recognition of the

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,570
fact that we can't expect these large

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,190
donations every year we want to get on

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,829
the income side to a more reliable

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,810
sustainable income to supporting

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:51,279
membership contracting out service year

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,790
and work improving that getting new

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,620
patrons so that we can sustain an

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,040
increased amount of spending longer term

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,410
and the expenses that we put into the

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,529
budget plan would allow us to keep

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,449
spending that way sort of at least for

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,690
three or four years and then as our

00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:12,699
sustainable funding goes up hopefully

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,490
then just keep doing that and just

00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:17,560
increase the scope and the scale of the

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,540
organization the hitch did we fit with

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,459
that it's just that we haven't actually

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,010
spent as much money as we put into the

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:27,519
budget plan we made it available but it

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,320
wasn't really spent this is sort of it's

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,199
a bit of a problem and don't

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,089
misunderstand me lamenting that but we

00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:36,910
don't want the board to drive things

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,860
top-down right the board can't say goals

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,709
people spent this money on our favorite

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,040
idea the most we can do is rally people

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,449
around submitting ideas but the

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,240
community and the membership needs to

00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:52,180
drive actually putting the funds to good

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,220
use I think in the financial working

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,310
group the hitch that we identified is

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,500
that we had all the talks we put

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,959
together the budget plan we put out the

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,019
budget plan and then stopped there this

00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:07,209
is clearly not enough we need to do more

00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:08,319
active work in constantly reminding

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,290
people that these resources are

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:13,300
available these ideas are there put in

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,300
the effort to actually use the resources

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,010
that you have I think within the

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,199
financial working group with wonderful

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,089
new members we've come to the decision

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,699
that this is what the financial working

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,649
group should be about it should take

00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,570
that leadership in the community and go

00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,210
out there be active engagements to go

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,610
Steam's engage with the website team and

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,010
keep reminding them that this is

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,630
available and that the financial working

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:43,240
group is there to help and that if we

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,100
can help be that relationship for

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,690
example to a contractor if the community

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,660
wants to contact somebody to get work

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,360
done we can take on the legal side and

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:58,300
the paperwork you figure out what to do

00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:02,020
we help you get it done which I now do

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:04,920
with a microphone a few years ago if we

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,020
go back a slide we also had some big

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,630
don't not quite even a comparison but we

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,580
have some big budgets around in 2014 we

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,710
had some canonical money and some other

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,090
money and we did the exact same thing of

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,970
going oh we'll save this for a rainy

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,470
year for a less good year and then it

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,830
has been a problem for ages when I

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,930
joined finance working group back then

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:31,540
leave without saying the same thing we

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:33,390
have too much money and now we have even

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,190
more too much money

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,680
well that summarizes this presentation

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,930
we have a lot of money that's the

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:51,520
takeaway right there do you have any

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:54,510
more questions why am i sprinting up

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,510
when you have a microphone

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:08,770
can you explain further how an a

00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:12,039
donation that allocates money to a

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:16,150
specific group of developers in our case

00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:19,870
caligra is going to work in practice so

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:21,970
generally speaking we don't it's hard

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,850
thing to say but we don't particularly

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,549
enjoy having earmarked donations we

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:30,789
don't have sort of a binding process to

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:33,010
earmark a donation it's for lack of a

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,559
better word it's a gentle person's

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,480
agreement that they gave us this money

00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:40,080
with the specific purpose in mind and we

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,730
as a community decided to honor that

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,409
honor that purpose and honor that wish

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,059
so we got that money from handshake and

00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:51,220
they wanted it to be put to use in

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,770
caligra so we submitted that to the

00:17:51,220 --> 00:18:01,630
legal community do you have useful

00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:05,020
things to say when that whole thing came

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,480
in the caligra community the developer

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,120
group such as it exists got together and

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,299
sat down jotted up a document describing

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:18,250
what we would like to spend that money

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:21,250
on I need to work out who of that group

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,830
is here because it would really yeah it

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,850
would be nice to actually kind of try

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,850
and wrap that up a bit

00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:36,100
there are ideas so yeah but to answer

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,320
your question specifically your question

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,250
was how does it work when we receive an

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,500
earmark donation

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,240
this is the extent to which it has

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,809
worked so far which is not very well

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,270
because we haven't spent it so we don't

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:52,419
have a great process in place because in

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,610
the end people on the ground who have

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:58,179
the money available need to put in the

00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:01,080
work to spend it thank you very much and

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,080
on we go

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:09,780
and we have pen and the system

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,350
administrators then we have the

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,970
fundraiser team who else is the

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,970
community working group giving a report

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:25,380
okay so yeah if and somebody told me to

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,080
just say if people are walking up and

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,150
down the stairs with the cable is on

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,270
please don't step on the cables they

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:38,670
will die and people will be sad then

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:42,960
thank you so we'll jump straight into a

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,970
concern we are running behind so we did

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,980
the numbers before this was done back

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,780
when the report was prepared this was a

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,920
while back but we sued over 25 terabytes

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,020
of data in June and assistants lavertus

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,270
600,000 emails every single week so

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,270
we're looking at between somewhere to 3

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,830
to 4 million emails a month that means

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,480
that we're actually considered what's

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,910
known as a high volume cinder and

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,160
actually if we move our email server

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,980
anywhere it actually takes about a week

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,810
or so before all the that Yahoo and AOL

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,280
will actually accept all the email we

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,100
were trying to send it takes a while for

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,630
to drain through and even Google these

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,960
systems take a while to get used to the

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,270
fact that we've moved somewhere else

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,920
otherwise you just get blacklisted so

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,350
the current members of the team myself

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,750
Nicholas who Sean Kinney and there's

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:34,680
also some other people who look after

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:37,160
various specific services so over the

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,690
past year we and this took a long time

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,180
migrated 12 Drupal 8 WordPress for

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,040
servicio room 6 media wiki instances

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,380
along with a metal instance looking

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,810
after our website statistics a mixture

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,630
of incidents for file exchange our forum

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,970
on PHP and our bug tracker bugzilla

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:58,430
all to a new shiny silver because the

00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:00,990
old one was 2014 point oh four hours for

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:04,140
they also let us shift the majority of

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,910
those to PHP 7 and it's moved since then

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,100
but there's now only I think the forum

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,950
and I believe 2 wiki instances that are

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,749
left on PHP 5.6 so we're nearly free of

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,940
PHP 5

00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:17,220
it's a few other sites just to lift on

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,590
php5 but the majority of our core

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,909
workloads are now fit offer which has

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,519
improved performance and a few other

00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:25,049
bits and pieces and helps with our

00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,369
upgrade paths because a lot of software

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,950
is actually now saying to cut off

00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:31,139
support for PHP 5 considering that the

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:39,179
PHP community is consider the

00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:41,460
end-of-life we also did some grades to

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,519
the elongate Network and we shifted the

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,679
web browsers for the get in subversion

00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,299
repositories to a server system so it

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,979
now means that when some web indexing

00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,749
robot decides that it's gonna go in

00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:53,580
hammer them that the inaugural occurs

00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:55,649
and short out on people in the CI system

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,070
starts giving fail builds which was

00:21:55,649 --> 00:22:01,559
happening because they short themselves

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,820
out the logo too high we also rebuilt

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,739
the way we murdered the nyan

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,970
repositories so now that when they go

00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:08,039
and delete a repository or move things

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,080
around the system just picks up

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,729
automatically rather than even having to

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,139
file a ticket because we removed from

00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:16,070
repositories and now they haven't

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:18,389
automatically delete themselves

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,979
real-time communication services will

00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:22,649
also all transfer to a separate machine

00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:25,200
they used to be co-hosted along with all

00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:28,019
those Drupal media wiki all those big

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,940
PHP systems and Bugzilla on the same

00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:33,269
server so we wanted to reboot that for a

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:36,059
new kernel we had to take all the IRC

00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:39,239
bounces and all that down to and because

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:42,539
of free no throttling it can take up to

00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:44,220
about two or so hours for our BNC to

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,940
reconnect every single person who's on

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,149
it because there's something like a

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,799
hundred accounts on there so that

00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:51,269
actually alleviated a lot of pain we can

00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,830
now reboot that system without him to

00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:57,019
worry we're gonna knock everyone else

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:59,039
out everyone out for like two hours and

00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:01,440
we brought whether it's not better

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,549
prosody and if you have a couple IRC

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,720
BOTS to those people who see screamer or

00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:10,619
pursuivant and any of the channels will

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,389
have seen them around Alex are also it

00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:15,899
moved home too because it needed to

00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:19,080
upgrade and we want em to be built there

00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:20,609
on a modern distribution and we also

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,190
resurrected a whole bunch of old stuff

00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:25,859
for what was new stuff doc a dog which

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,150
was the second generation of get hot new

00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,610
start

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,930
I believe it was because there was some

00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,310
application still relying on their in

00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,800
their functionality based have indeed

00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:37,910
since we killed commit filter sometime

00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,740
last year so that's now backups at least

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,590
in static forms those applications

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,990
continue to work for people who rely on

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,610
stone hopefully at some point all those

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,950
resources will shift on to a store at

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,050
kita org so we can actually just shut

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,090
that off as well because get hot new

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,150
stuff Division one we still host it as

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,590
set of copies to the continuous

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,200
integration system one's got a big

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,790
overhaul Jenkins jobs got moved into a

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,560
big folder tree system so you cannot go

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,750
through and find just your project and

00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,360
set up an RSS feed or something just for

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,070
your project or just have one quick link

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,850
to see this is the status of my jobs

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,960
both master and stable ranch and there

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,350
was a whole bunch of version upgrades

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,820
and the Jenkins marcin sensors also

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:25,370
shifted to a new server on backwards

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,670
good labs that's probably the biggest

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,390
kind of item that's kind of come up

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,210
following feedback at last year's

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,830
Academy we had a look at good lab itself

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,750
did a bit of a technical evaluation and

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,390
then we did a practical evaluation with

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,580
a selection of projects that we asked

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,960
the community basically if you meet

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,200
these criteria please stick your hand up

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,640
some people did and they they gave get

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,870
lab a good soil testing we gathered a

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,300
whole bunch of feedback from that and

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,220
then launched into a kind of discussion

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,810
with the broader community pouring the

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,510
consensus on that was that we should

00:24:53,810 --> 00:25:01,220
migrate from our current fabricator

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:03,470
system for review to get lab most new

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,440
projects in fact I'd say all by actually

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,420
anything that's gone on to frameworks or

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,100
applications or plasma evening an extra

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,590
gear and playground they've all gone

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,530
immediately to get lab none of them have

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,980
actually been going into fabricator the

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:22,160
only reason the things and applications

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,900
frameworks and Plasma are in not going

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,730
to get lab is because it causes issues

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,850
for the release projects prices for

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,980
those so we keeping it kind of separate

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,720
for now at the moment we're solving

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,060
process of finalizing what you've got

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,860
and what we need to get in place to move

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,140
everyone to get lab so there's a few

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,580
bits and pieces around

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,490
elongate because there has to be fully

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,050
rebuilt and identity synchronizations

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,180
when you change your email address or we

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,620
make someone a developer or something

00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,560
anything like that that it just sinks

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,790
across instantaneously and just the

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,400
seamless because at the moment it's

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,870
actually a huge kind of issue because

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,300
it's not we have to go manually add

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,190
people to the developer group in good

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,690
lab at the same time as the normal heart

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,920
developer process which is everything

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,050
that's on there and we're going to

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,760
transfer responsibility SSH key

00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,860
management from identity to get lab

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,300
because it makes no sense to build a

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,120
whole bunch of synchronization stuff for

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,910
that when there's only really one other

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,080
system than easy search keys and there's

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,540
subversion and we can just pull them

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,410
from get lab to its API this is no point

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,030
you've heard the logic there where we

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,640
need help we've yet to find a solution

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,710
to API doc here or I believe there was a

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,900
discussion on mailing lists about maybe

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:38,290
one or two months ago it's fragile

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,610
moment the existing setup the old-style

00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,590
scripts which have we can carried over

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,690
from like Katie three Katie for and

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,690
actually the templates for that still

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,100
come from the old Katie libs repository

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,460
we had to make effects to those somewhat

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,710
recently which I which I did we really

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,390
need to solve that one because at the

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,010
moment you have to go hunting real

00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,690
unless you ever dig through a log find

00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,070
out how it's dying because of this or

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,720
this link needs you updated because of

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,430
this and it's over here in this

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,850
repository which you'd never expect it

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,840
to be in so if you know one would like

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,890
to work on that please

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,200
give us way key goals for the coming

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,400
year I want to complete the migration to

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,640
get lab we won't get everything across

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,740
we want to basically static eyes

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,350
fabricator or shadow completely

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,240
depending on how we go there are

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,900
approximately ninety websites there are

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,250
left on one single one to 1404 system at

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,020
the time of writing that was true

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,110
there's now only one website left on

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:38,490
that Mak your org level will now be

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,420
moved off onto a new 18.4 system and

00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,610
identity continues to be a critical

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,050
issue the number we've set to be the

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,660
number of user accounts we have in there

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,670
now is actually it's continuing to cause

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,640
open all that serious scalability

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:56,340
problems

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:58,559
any questions unfortunately we don't

00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,630
have time for more questions and we will

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,150
head over to lies and you are available

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:24,840
for questions after this I guess thank

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:26,669
you hello I will be very quickly most of

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,360
the stuff that we are doing I keep

00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:35,610
talking to here on it on the view report

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:37,950
we are kind of lazy on our goals because

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,450
we got these large donations and we

00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,570
didn't make the frontal racist campaign

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,700
but we are trying with Ixion to fix

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,929
their PayPal issues and we are hoping to

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,210
folks poking here on PayPal and our our

00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:57,270
platform is to see if we can help them

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:58,890
to do this faster coordinated products

00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,960
are not route of promotional material

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,540
for fundraising campaigns we need more

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,450
at the years I think to get another ways

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,700
to do to get money besides they phone

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:13,290
our fundraising campaign so we are

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:16,080
hosting above Tuesday Thursday I don't

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,490
recall correctly and anyone that wants

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,970
to discuss or join the fundraising

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,140
please come it's a crucial for the

00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,210
various campaigns we are now doing that

00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,549
improve technical infrastructure about

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,460
their websites our fundraising I have

00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:33,960
made a new fundraising website but I'm

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:38,220
waiting for day the issues of PayPal be

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:42,780
fixed so we can out that members all

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,240
these people last year is just the

00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:50,940
support for PayPal in working we fixing

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,980
on CBC area we are not as active as we

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,350
would like the last one is that need is

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,090
need to be changing and we have taken it

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,970
some steps to do that we have a telegram

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,890
chat we are going to start our monthly

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,350
meeting

00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,970
the fabricator world and the both here

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,900
on academy so we can screw through the

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:12,750
rest of that so we need help if they

00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,120
want anyone go once to join is because

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:19,280
the active member are me Alex

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,860
Kenny and the scholars so come together

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,700
and for now we have improvements on the

00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,040
web presence

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,160
suppose for from the razor forceful eyes

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:33,570
if needed fabric you use fabricator

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:36,030
and this is my idea I think that this

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:38,160
buffer is on Thursday is a credit card

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,560
acumen it's instituto mad mad because i

00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,420
think for me that i'm community for

00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,110
since 2015

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:48,210
i would like to have a macro view of the

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:51,060
community see what is inside

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,010
so we have our have a both that i

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,560
probably have a lot of postage so it can

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,020
build a mind map of all these structure

00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,200
in korea so he can have a macro view and

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,420
they get that together if the goals and

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,420
see what lessons we can learn from that

00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,580
and show people what we have here so

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,890
they can track it themselves easier

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,290
inside the community so this is another

00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,410
buff you can check on this academy

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:20,130
schedule and if you need to talk to us

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:25,229

thank you very much and then a short

00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:37,090
sentence from Murray there's not a whole

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:41,140
lot we can talk about publicly we handed

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:46,179
handle maybe a case a month we worked

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:48,280
pretty closely with sysadmin some of the

00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:51,010
trolls are pretty easy to deal with the

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,570
system ends just kill them on our system

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,900
and we don't have to put up with them

00:31:52,570 --> 00:32:00,690
anymore what's much tougher is people we

00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,690
love getting into disagreements and

00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:08,860
miscommunication we really want you to

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:11,890
continue to come to us when you find a

00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:16,720
pain point because that's what we want

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,510
to do is make things pleasant a pleasant

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:26,740
