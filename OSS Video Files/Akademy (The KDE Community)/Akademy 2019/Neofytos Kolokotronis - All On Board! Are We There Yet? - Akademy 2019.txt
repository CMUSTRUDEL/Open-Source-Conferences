Description: 
	The KDE mother ship has been sailing towards the "Streamlined Onboarding" land for almost 2 years now. I often ask myself if this goal will ever be reached. Will it ever be concluded? This talk is an attempt to answer this question. It should be interesting and hopefully inspiring to everyone in the KDE community.
