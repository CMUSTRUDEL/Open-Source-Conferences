Title: Marco Martin & Bhushan Shah - Plasma for Embedded Devices - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Plasma is not only Desktop, as shown by our effort in Plasma Mobile project, but we can go even further than that.

The talk will make the case that Plasma and other KDE technologies are ready for embedded development on single-purpose ARM devices, analyzing real world use cases, both from an UI and hardware adaptation standpoints.
The talk will analyse Plasma Mobile and a voice assistant device, built with Mycroft and Plasma Shell as its sole UI.

Deploying Plasma on such devices have multiple challenges, Bhushan Will talk about them and solutions offered by KDE community. Marco will talk about how is possible to have a completely different plasma based user interface which even tough sharing the same runtime of Plasma Desktop, doesn't retain any Desktop-specific user interface.
