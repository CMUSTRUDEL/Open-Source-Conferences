00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
people i

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,360
asked to to the only condition

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,799
i i asked they had to be people who used

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
computers regularly right and that they

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,240
were

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
did not belong to our community and if

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,360
possible not to

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,880
the linux community right now that is a

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,159
very big

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,159
demo okay but

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,280
yeah the vlc i think

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,079
oh maybe yes maybe

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,240
all right okay i hope it doesn't blow

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,840
your ears out

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:55,840
right so first question do you know what

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,840
the desktop environment is

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,620
[Music]

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,089
[Music]

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,910
[Music]

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,040
a friendly user interface for the

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
for the user to you know use the

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,840
computer

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,840
um it's the

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,819
[Music]

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:57,600
[Music]

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:12,539
um

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:12,539
[Music]

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
okay

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,400
[Music]

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,810
[Music]

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,680
oh sorry that's starting off again it's

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
on the loop okay

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,799
yeah exactly the thing is that um

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,720
i think that the the the talk before

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
maybe i should have gone after this one

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,519
you know uh

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,799
first we have to i think that

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,159
maybe our priority is to tell people

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,280
that we exist

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,360
and then they will know and then you can

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,040
tell them where to get our stuff

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,079
you know it's so this is the thing

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,759
um a lot of people think

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,680
that promo is for the kd

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,720
community no these are the people

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
we are going to you must this this these

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,880
interviews

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
i didn't uh or i asked the other people

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,639
to do them

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,240
without any kind of spite we are

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,600
not trying to show oh look at all these

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,320
clueless people

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,040
that is not it at all that is not it at

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,520
all

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:57,440
the thing is that if you go out outside

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,199
uh the immediate circle of kde everybody

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
has this level of knowledge of what we

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,240
do which is

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,520
nothing okay nobody

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,720
outside a very very small number of

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,280
people in the world

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,720
know what we do or even that we exist

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,160
okay so

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,360
and that is promo's job right

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
promo's job is to get as many people as

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,720
possible

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,840
to know about us outside our circle

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,240
we do not cater to you

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,000
in promo we do not create it to anybody

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,440
here you already know

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,560
plenty about what's going on in here

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,560
it's everybody else we are worried about

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,840
okay from a free software point of view

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,120
it is also consistent with our

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,199
principles we are here to save them

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
right you don't need saving you're

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,319
already you know

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,960
in desktop heaven

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:07,120
okay so i have a little presentation

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,240
as uh it is

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,800
as the the the the

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
my talk has been cut i well sorry it

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
hasn't been cut

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
i have a bit less time than i thought i

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,120
will go

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,120
directly to the most important bits okay

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,400
right okay

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,360
so

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,080
um basically what we do in the promo

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
oh it's on some sort of

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,160
what we do in the promos is we try

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,680
and uh

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,440
achieve our goals yeah i know

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
i don't know how to switch that off

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,560
it's ocular so

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,039
nope

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,039
okay the thing is i'll stop it if

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:36,080
damn it okay

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,199
okay okay right whatever right yeah okay

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,479
so uh the thing is we have to

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,720
there we go we have to try and

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,879
achieve our goals that is the short

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,919
story of what we do in the promos

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
if you go to that address you will see

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,759
our goals

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,120
our goals are basically get more people

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,479
to know about kde and about our software

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,720
that is

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:06,240
the not the the the kernel of what we do

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,280
right now um

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,960
uh that has several

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,960
sub goals in it like

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
get more users to find about uh find

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
help

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,319
users find out about our software help

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,120
companies find out about our software

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:30,400
help companies use our frameworks uh

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,440
talk to uh governments so that they can

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,479
use things like g-comprising schools

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,279
etc etc etc but it's all getting more

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
users

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,320
to use our software more developers to

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,920
use our software more contributors

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,560
to the community basically that is it

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,440
the thing is that promo is not a goal

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,800
has hasn't got any goals of its own

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
it's goalception we have goals for other

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,440
people

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,000
right so if you go to those

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,839
to that those list of goals you will see

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,880
they all start with the word

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,320
help say help the

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,600
community acquire more contributors

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,440
help such and such do this we don't do

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,399
anything for ourselves we are so

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,480
selfless in promo you cannot imagine you

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,600
know

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,680
so our goals are

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,720
to help other people in the community

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,760
to do to achieve their goals right

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,839
um and we have a problem is that we do

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
not

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,320
have any sort of like

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,240
milestones to make we don't have things

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,360
like releases

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,880
we don't have uh uh

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,200
well we don't have version numbers on

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,320
our campaigns or anything like that

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,640
so it's kind of hard to see that promo

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,760
is doing anything at all

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,800
right and that is as it should be

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,320
right our stuff is invisible

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
it's like the translation group

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
suddenly there is another language that

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,120
is supported

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
on x software right but nobody really

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,760
talks about it

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,640
but that makes it that little bit better

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,360
suddenly people are talking about us

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,720
more

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,800
in the media you know a fraction more

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
and that is what we in promo have

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
achieved but it's not something that you

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,920
can say

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,839
hey you know mission accomplished

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,360
right so

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,120
we also um

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,640
apart from apart from getting more

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,000
people talking about us

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,519
we try and figure out

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,800
stuff like how to do things better

00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,240
right and this is this is

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
where we hit uh uh problems with inside

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,120
the community as you know

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,160
uh promo has not had like um

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,200
a smooth sailing within kd to say the

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:16,240
least

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:19,839
right but well it's true

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
well it's true you know but the problem

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,800
is

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,519
that that when uh when we do stuff

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,519
people can you know turn up angry on our

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,040
doorstep and say why did you do that

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,160
or why didn't you do that and

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,440
you have to understand no they say you

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,480
didn't do that sorry

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,680
and we have to explain why

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,600
right so uh

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,200
normally it is because in our area of

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,639
expertise we tend to know a bit better

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,600
in about that right um

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,680
so i'm going to give you an example of

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
uh

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,200
how we do things slightly better and how

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
we

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
say things the way we do and stuff like

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
that

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,920
this is a this is a tweet from

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,440
the linux application summit right

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,959
that they put out and

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
we thought we could improve this

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,079
you know and being arrogant the arrogant

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,920
bastards we are

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,360
we tried and so they

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,320
we had to advertise this on our side we

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,240
we actually retweeted this but it still

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
only got five retweets and ten likes

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,160
which is

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:48,880
pretty low so we put out our own tweet

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,760
and we did this right

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,440
that is alesh that is albert and we did

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,480
the montage

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
and we gave it a name and things like

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,279
that

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,880
and voila five times more retweets

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
five times more likes

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,200
is there anybody from canadian life here

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
there's never anyone from creating life

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
because

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,560
and i always and i always go after them

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,279
because they do so many they do such a

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
great software

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,839
they do such a crap job at promoting

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
their

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,680
that i always want them here and they're

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,480
never here well anyway

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,680
so they did this kd live 18041 released

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,959
okay so this is on reddit

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,720
they got um what is it

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:43,680
two comments 83 upvotes

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,600
so by mistake i posted my own version

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
right this was an honest mistake i

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
wasn't out to

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,839
shame them or anything like this so i

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,360
posted this i don't know if you can read

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,519
that oh yes you can read that perfectly

00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,839
183 upvotes

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,120
17 comments and it was posted after

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,160
theirs

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
right so

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,079
normally when they when somebody comes

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,880
to us and says why did you say

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,320
things like that it's because we know

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,560
what we're doing

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
right you really really have to start

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,480
trusting us

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:26,079
on this it's the same way that uh

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:30,560
uh there are stuff we don't do

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,120
and we have reasons to not do it too

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
so these are these are things you know

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,000
this is not my job from

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,040
a site called not my job but anyway

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,160
so what happens is there is stuff

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,680
that people come along and say oh we

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,399
should do this

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,600
x i don't know the latest one i hope the

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,920
person who proposed

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,760
is not here somebody came along and said

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,440
we should promote um

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,959
a certain mp3 app okay

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,240
and my reaction was why

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,240
you know what do we achieve now i didn't

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,000
do it mean spiritedly

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,079
i said why give me a reason to do this i

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,639
it was not in our plans

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:24,240
to to promote an mp3 app any mp3 app

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,839
um so why would you do that

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,680
what goal does it help us achieve

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,360
the first thing that anybody that comes

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,759
by and asks promo to do

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,040
is i send them to the to the god says

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,920
read the goals

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,480
find out your plan what you want us to

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,040
do

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,040
if it fits in any of them if it doesn't

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
we probably won't do it you can do it

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,519
but we won't

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,880
okay and not only that you have to

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,600
reason to me how you get from your idea

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,320
to achieving one of our goals right it's

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
just not

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
so for example somebody can say let's

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,600
promote this mp3 player

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,160
why because it's awesome okay on what to

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
achieve

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,440
if we promote this awesome applications

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,560
we get

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,279
more users which is one of your goals

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,639
okay how do you get from it's awesome to

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,839
you get more users

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,519
you may think in your mind you may think

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,959
there is a direct link

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,440
there isn't because we all agree

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
that hearing kde we produce awesome

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,839
software

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,680
why don't we have more users then

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,880
right so anybody who comes by

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,680
with i call them uh fly by

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
idea shooters right they come by give an

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,160
idea and then

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,360
piss off so if

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,639
anybody comes by with an idea

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,959
like this i normally send them also to

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,560
our workboard our workboard has

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,199
over 60 open tasks right and these are

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
stuff

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,320
that we have decided are important are

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,959
working on and can't because we

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
don't have enough bandwidth okay so they

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,959
can go there

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,720
and do stuff like that

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,400
and that's if anybody has an idea

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,280
you can go there the other thing

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
is that we can put things on a on a sort

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,720
of a graph

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
right there are stuff there is stuff

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
that is

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,360
helpful to do because it helps us

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,880
progress towards a goal

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,120
and there is stuff that is pointless

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
that goes doesn't take us anywhere near

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,200
any of our goals

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,640
and then there's stuff that is popular

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,919
right that gets us lots of coverage

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,400
which i suppose is helpful in itself

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,919
i'm not sure and then there's stuff that

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,039
gets ignored

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:55,360
right now this is a this is a bit

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:58,160
hard to swallow but um

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,640
popular and helpful normally very often

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,720
don't go on the same

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,760
axis you know stuff that is popular is

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,320
not

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,799
is often not very helpful for example we

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
can

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,880
congratulate other people's projects a

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,880
lot

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
so we say happy birthday nom happy

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,280
birthday debian happy birthday

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,080
this happy birthday that happy birthday

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,360
office

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,039
whatever um these are

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,600
super popular posts they get hundreds of

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,840
retweets

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,039
literally hundreds of retweets and

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,120
hundreds of likes

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,240
and lots of people talk about them they

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,240
serve no purpose

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,679
they do not get us anywhere near our

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,799
goals

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,480
right reminiscing

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:48,080
talking about oh you know 20 years

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,200
of of kde and we post a load of

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,840
uh screenshots of kd one and two and

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,880
three and four etc

00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,240
lovely gets us nowhere near our goals

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:04,559
at promo's goals okay promise goals

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,360
right um we publish from time to time we

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,440
publish jokes

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,480
they're fun people retweet them nothing

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,679
 talking in other projects it's

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,120
totally pointless it's it's

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,039
something that is very popular people

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,520
like controversy people like saying

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
oh no they're so you know they're so

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,559
lame

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,320
et cetera but it gets us nowhere near

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,720
our goals

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,640
promos goals now here i have to

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,720
distinguish between what is promo code

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,679
and what is community building some of

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
these things

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,440
contribute to community building right

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,360
some of these things serve as a social

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
greece within the community

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,039
you know to make the community feel

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,919
better about themselves

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,039
right and that helps that is a good

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
thing

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
that makes people feel more at home

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,720
within the community

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,240
etc but that

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,039
does not help promo's goal of

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
acquiring more users or acquiring more

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,600
companies

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,520
to use our stuff or anything like that

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,400
it gets nowhere or at least

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,440
not in a direct way it may be

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,360
you know now uh release announcements on

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,559
the other hand

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,600
are useful and they're very popular look

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,280
great you put them out hundreds of

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,240
retweets hundreds of

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,640
comments on reddit hundreds of things

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,200
and

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,960
you also serve a clear purpose which is

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
getting more people to know about our

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
software maybe download it and maybe use

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,320
it

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:47,360
right and info about end user apps

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,000
anything about mobile phones that is

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
that

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
that is crazy anything any there's a

running plasma mobile will automatically

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,320
get you

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,760
300 upvotes on reddit

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,039
um helpful but not popular

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,360
security advisories and this is a hard

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,240
one

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,880
post about academy or a or for that fact

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,480
any event we participate in

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,280
are not popular people tend to ignore

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,400
them

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,080
for some reason i don't i really i

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,679
really don't understand that one

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,280
they are useful of course they are

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,400
useful you have to tell people about the

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
stuff you're doing

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,039
you have to tell them about the venture

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,559
organizers so they can come they can

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,559
register they can do this like that

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,919
so they are very helpful but for some

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,960
reason they are not popular

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,440
stuff that are not helpful stuff in this

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
area

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,960
is stuff that we would tend to try and

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,720
avoid doing

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,039
right so if somebody comes along and

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,919
says oh can we talk about

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,760
this post i have in my blog and it's

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,799
something really technical

00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,080
something to do with with i don't know

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:03,600
adjusting something in a framework or

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,159
some something really technical

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
there's not much point in doing that

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,360
because it's not popular

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
and it's not helpful it doesn't help us

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,159
get any near our goals

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,159
of acquiring more

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,880
users it may be helpful to

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,799
make that particular developer like us

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,039
more

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,440
but it's not it does not achieve

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,840
any it does not get us any nearer to any

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,880
of our goals

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,440
posts about academy after academy

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,880
are not very useful and they're not very

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
popular either

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,960
because you know academy is already gone

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,240
by the time we put that out

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,280
right again this is uh

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,280
uh you it is useful

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
as i say this is all in terms of what

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,880
our goals say

00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:01,280
it is useful for inside the community

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,880
right for uh uh

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,360
boosting community morale or whatever or

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,400
people who couldn't come etc but

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,520
normally whatever you inform here

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,520
people already know about

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,320
and talking about internal admin like

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,480
saying i don't know we have a new board

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,840
member etc is normally

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,760
is not very useful for our goals and it

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,760
is not very useful

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,760
and is not very popular so

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,159
so that was where i was going to play

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,279
the video

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,840
now the thing is um

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,400
the question is do these the things we

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,600
do

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,679
work do by selecting our content

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
and by reworking our content does it

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,480
work yes objectively

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,520
does right so this here

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,279
is we took over uh

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,720
the the linkedin account this was

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,279
important for us because we wanted to

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,799
reach

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:10,159
a more professional uh uh

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,400
audience so we took the the linkedin

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:17,200
account in september

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,720
2018 and well before that nobody had

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,480
bothered to download

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,640
the the stats from from uh

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240
linkedin which is another thing we do we

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,559
download

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,000
tons of stats and we analyze them and we

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,200
put them into something

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that we can understand so uh

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
but my

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,240
my thought is that they probably were or

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,360
these these are a number

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,000
of uh people that joined

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
start following us right so zero zero

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
zero is because no

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,240
we don't have the information and then

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,640
it said three two and one twenty eight

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
and instead

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,640
okay it goes into three figures right

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,400
from the moment we take over

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,440
this is what uh

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,799
the followers in kd's

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,520
in our uh in arcades in red on reddit

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,039
okay

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,000
so we took over uh here

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,720
not here i think he ah here exactly at

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,240
this bend

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,480
right so uh we took over there

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,919
and we started pushing radius a lot you

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
can see that it's sort of like it's

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,320
going up

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,840
fantastic but then suddenly it goes all

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,080
the way up

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:40,400
right now there's a lot of bragging

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,400
in this i'm sorry about that

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,400
so that is twitter

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,279
now uh again uh uh before we took over

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,679
people were not uh nobody had thought of

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,480
taking stats these are twitter followers

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,400
now there is a slight there's a slight

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,520
bend there in

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,799
somewhere between 2007 and 2018.

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,520
do you see that well that bend

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,400
is different this when we took over and

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,760
it goes from

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,240
that is that pain signifies that from

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,200
450 followers a month we went over to

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,559
over a thousand a month

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,559
okay um

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,360
sorry i went back this is the number of

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,400
mentions in publications

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,200
again nobody had taken any note of how

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,559
many times we appeared in the press

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,600
right and

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,640
um sure i so i don't know what happened

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,679
before 2017

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,200
but as you can see this is uh

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,640
this is um quarterly right so there's a

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
big bump there because

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,440
we probably published something there

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,919
was some sort of release there or

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
something

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,000
but as you can see from there on it

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,520
gradually goes up and up and up and it

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
continues going up

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,159
so there are more people we now have

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,880
journalists that are fans especially

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,840
journalists or fans of of nate graham

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,520
and

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,400
i am very jealous um

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,600
we have people uh i mean we used to

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,679
never appear on

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,880
in for onyx now we appear regularly in

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,919
pharonix

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,640
uh we used to appear sometimes

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,640
in um

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,840
sofpedia but now we appear nearly

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,650
every couple of days we also have

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,480
appeared in our publications

00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,279
[Music]

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,640
and i could brag all afternoon but i

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,240
would not

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:49,840
so then that's it

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,840
now any questions

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,600
have i gone over time

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,840
for 10 minutes no i'm not gonna go i'm

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,840
gonna i want questions

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
yes

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,600
well one of the biggest quote

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,440
i used to be a i used to be a teacher

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,159
right i used to be

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
an english teacher one of the and of all

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,039
the skills i learned

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,240
the most important was to be patient

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:29,279
i mean that is the most thing so

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,559
what i ask the communities to be patient

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,840
and if you don't see

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,960
why we did or didn't do anything coming

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,000
before getting angry come in and ask we

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,799
cannot

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,600
we cannot explain every single step of

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
what we do

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,679
all the time because otherwise we

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,880
wouldn't do anything else

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,919
right so come to

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,960
come to uh our matrix channel or

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,080
telegram channel

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,600
or whatever uh or

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,080
irc channel and and do what

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,960
some guys did a couple of weeks ago and

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,240
asked us

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,960
why we had taken out their

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,840
uh uh contributions to the release

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,840
announcement

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,799
they had i can't remember what project

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,520
they were from

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,520
so what was

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,200
what was that i guess that plot that is

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,559
correct

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,960
yes they had done some changes to

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,480
a cantor that's the one they had done

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,440
some changes to kantor

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,200
now these changes were tending towards

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,159
the rava technical

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:47,200
and we decided that instead of

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:50,240
doing a great big long shopping list of

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,679
of of uh changes

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,559
in the in the in the release

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,679
announcement

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,559
we would leave that to the we would

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,960
leave that

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,200
obviously in the change log and refer

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,000
people to that who wanted those details

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,799
and we would try to make the

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,840
announcement

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,399
more article-like why

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,679
because journalists are lazy uh by

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,880
definition

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,679
this they so what happens is if you give

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,440
a journalist

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,600
a list of changes they're gonna read

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,480
like

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
four lines they're gonna say oh it

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,679
i'm not gonna do this

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
i i can't i can't turn this into an

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,919
article but if you give them

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,080
a quotable article something they can

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,640
lift wholesale and poop

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,440
and put and then get paid for doing a

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,440
copy paste

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,799
then you have a journalist on your side

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,000
so and that was the reason why we

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,080
got we we took the notes

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and we said okay what can we use what is

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,960
what is the most

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,679
the most sort of like thing we can

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,720
describe

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,919
best we can we can that

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,720
sounds exciting and we can turn into a

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
story

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
what changed every change has to have a

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,360
story behind it

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,640
right normally the story is uh

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,159
uh or it corrects a bug that was

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,279
annoying people

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:24,480
or it makes things faster it makes

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,919
it makes things crash less or it adds

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,720
features

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,519
basically that's what interests

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,640
everybody

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,679
for users it's normally it adds

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,600
features right for business people

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,279
it crashes less and it makes my workers

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,840
work faster

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
or helps my workers work faster normally

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,399
that

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:50,080
that is it so um uh we

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,799
got the stories that we thought that

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,600
could would appeal to journalists and to

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,640
end users

00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,159
and to the audience we were going to

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,039
and we use those it doesn't mean in any

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,279
case that we

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,080
think that la plot and cantos the

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,159
developers

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,919
their their work we don't think it's

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,080
less than anything else they say

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,840
oh but you always talk about kdenlive

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,640
and krita okay there are two reasons for

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,200
that

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,000
one is that kdenlive and krita have come

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,600
to us

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,640
and asked to work with us right

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,640
and anyway

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,799
yeah and that's never that that's

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,960
another one and

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,600
the other one is that uh uh

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
it is true they are very niche

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,880
applications

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
but they are very popular in those

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,279
niches so

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,080
we use them as an excuse to drag

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,360
everybody else

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
up right so we can always refer to

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,600
canadian life

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,120
and krita and outside our bubble

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,080
many people will know what we're talking

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,840
about even outside the linux bubble they

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,840
will know what we're talking about

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,360
so we use them as let's say i was going

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,880
to say

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,840
donkeys but i'll say oxen oxen

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,120
drag other applications along with them

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,440
okay camels okay

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,679
they're camels okay next question

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,679
yes

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,399
when i tell someone in the real life

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,000
to not to use this proprietary

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,760
application but

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,440
use that free software application

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,360
in a way i try to let them know that

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
they have to use not a better

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,679
application

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,720
but a more moral application a more

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,320
ethical application

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,760
in a way i try to de-educate them

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,240
from the proprietary paradigm and

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,880
re-educated not in a paternalistic way

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,720
in an

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,600
inclusive way yeah to a a different

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,320
moral level of making software do you

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,600
see it

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,960
as a part of promo or it is

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,240
something that should start after using

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,919
kd software um

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,440
it is not a tool that promo can use

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,639
unfortunately uh uh

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,919
our conviction uh

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
of all of us in promo is that we are

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,639
doing

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,280
uh something that is morally right

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,639
otherwise we wouldn't do it

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,919
okay um but

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,359
convincing people that it is better

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:45,119
morally better that uh it is some

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:48,320
somehow better for the world and for

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,639
uh the environment etc

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,839
and for the rights for their own rights

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,599
etc

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,879
normally that doesn't enter the equation

00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,440
at all think of instagram

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:04,000
okay instagram belongs to facebook

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,720
facebook is probably the most deplorable

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,400
company

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,960
i.t company in the world does it matter

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,960
not a bit

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
people still use instagram their user

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,839
base

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,839
continues to grow

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,079
we're talking about billions of users of

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,119
instagram

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,040
right yeah facebook is in decline but

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,560
that's because there's only old fogies

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,359
like me

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,160
that's that still maybe use well i don't

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,800
use it any

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,920
for anything personal anymore but

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
basically but

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,359
instagram belongs to the same company

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,920
spy is exactly the same on all users

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,200
and that is growing facebook is

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,000
declining

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,440
uh because it is not cool anymore

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
instagram is growing because it's still

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,119
cool

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,079
and that and everybody knows this i mean

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,400
it's not like

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,920
nobody knows that facebook is terrible

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,599
and that instagram belongs to facebook

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,240
everybody knows this

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,320
well maybe not but okay a lot of people

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,079
know it

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:11,440
so yeah the moral argument unfortunately

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,440
is not something we can use

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,960
even if it's in the benefit of of

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,960
of the individual sorry yes question

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,880
um as you said that kde is also making

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,440
many uh awesome end user applications

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,359
and as a result we saw this gsog

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
creating many ports for the applications

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,920
for windows mac

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,960
could you repeat i um like in this gsoc

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,680
we saw many

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,839
new projects that were ports of already

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,880
existing awesome applications

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:46,000
of kde on linux and we saw the ports

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,400
coming to android windows and mac os

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,359
so how do you think these new projects

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,119
align with the

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,119
goals of kde promo

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,200
so do i understand the question

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,200
correctly

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,640
uh uh that are you asking

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,920
whether applications going to android

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,280
and other platforms

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,119
helps us um like promoting those

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,320
does promoting those applications which

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,960
are not on linux

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,960
helps uh the goals of kd promo

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:25,119
yeah it's it's fine i mean uh uh kde

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,359
doesn't only produce uh uh plasma

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,119
and software for plasma that that is

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,400
fine uh uh

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,960
to use uh to to promote applications

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,440
that

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,000
uh i mean take krita for example krita

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,760
has many more users on windows

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,880
than on on linux but by various factors

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,720
you know they have

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,320
they have you know tens of thousands on

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,960
windows and then

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:55,599
some thousands on on linux you know

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,599
that is not i used to think that this

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,640
was bad

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,000
and then reality struck and i don't

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,599
think it's bad anymore

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,839
i i find it a bit deplorable you know i

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,200
prefer all the stuff i would prefer all

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,320
the stack to be

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,320
to be free but

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,000
you know

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,520
no no we just we try to convince

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,960
everybody to use matrix

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,839
we are only partially successful

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,520
so we can take one more last question

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,920
okay

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,119
it's not a question it's a information

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,320
for a promo team

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:42,160
in kerala every year 500 000

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:45,359
around 500 000 kids use all most of the

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,680
educational applications of kde and all

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,040
around 100 000 teachers also always

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,839
tease

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,920
so every year the number is 500 000 so

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,240
it's a good number for kda thing

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,079
but they don't use plasma i don't think

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,240
they will use soon because

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,560
malayalam spell checker in plasma is

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,599
very bad what do they use it on then

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,560
on windows no no they are they all

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,560
only know linux all the schools only run

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,280
gnu linux which is ideal school

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,760
so if you don't know them also yes okay

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,800
they have good support for malayalam

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
there is this thing that that that i

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,640
mean

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,680
that is that is by you know by all

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,720
measures better than than oh he's gone

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,839
then what the uh

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,520
these other ah whatever your name is

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,960
what it's proposing so they're using

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,839
gnome nominees and them

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,560
are enemy right anonymous entire

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,240
competitor

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,000
you know who are competitors are

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,880
competitors windows

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,400
our competitors macos right we have less

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,400
than one percent

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,000
less but much less than one percent of

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
the desktop market
