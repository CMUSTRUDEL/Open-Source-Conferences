good afternoon everyone so today I'm

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,060
going to be presenting a new project

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,730
that I've been working on it's called

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,330
the order - project it's going to be a

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,570
demo of a car and infotainment system so

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,070
to introduce the project order - is an

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,670
open source in in-car infotainment

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,820
system that provides a combined platform

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,710
for information delivery and

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,900
entertainment it's based on open source

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,219
technologies it's based on top of plasma

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:37,440
at Kagame and it is powered by a micro

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:41,190
Freya's was the voice assistant so

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,550
before I get to the goals I would like

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,219
to say that so a lot of companies a lot

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,590
of manufacturers today are coming out

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,199
with cars with smart and 14 systems

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,280
those modern 15 systems are generally

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,430
closed down or don't have aren't modular

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,890
and most of the data that they say that

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,199
they have smart assistants that year is

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,600
probably going to Google server or it's

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,880
going to an Amazon ethic so so there's

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,909
hardly any privacy in those smart

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,619
entertainment systems so the need so

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,750
that there is a need for happening or

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,450
having an open source infotainment

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,990
system in goss the goal of this project

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,640
is to be extendable to be modular and

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,220
have a privacy friendly voice assistant

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,009
experience so when I talk about being

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,159
extendable and being module on let me

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,130
just explain the architecture of this

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,900
project so what you see on the screen is

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,750
that it's it's more yellow in the sense

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:47,399
the qml user interface for the dashboard

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,770
is based off separate models one is the

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,200
dashboard model a navigation model and

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,960
music model they have their own sub

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,930
modules that's external - and internal

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,869
dashboard I explore nearby module

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,610
directions module for area more you Ana

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,579
music player

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,280
there are some modules these can be

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,739
easily activated deactivated depending

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,420
on what your car as a manufacturer would

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,730
you would like to

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:18,980
in your current entertainment system on

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,080
the other architecture side this is

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,410
powered by Microsoft voice user

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:31,190
interface the entire UI is is provided

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,500
data by the order - micro of skill so

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:37,040
this skill is also divided into sections

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,560
based on the mod on the modules of the

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,090
UI its segregated into dashboard

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,900
navigation and music

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:48,770
each module controls its specific ease

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:54,080
its separation the skill controls its

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,000
specific module on the UI so now coming

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,989
to the main thing is the dashboard so

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,810
the dashboard has two views - some

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,970
modules call them the first one is an

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,500
external sub module the external

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,200
dashboard and so what it has is

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,420
basically it has all the controls the

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,970
physical controls external controls of a

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,630
car that would that would be on a

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,130
dashboard like your car those

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,590
controlling Kardos your headlight system

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,600
your wiper blade system and it also

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,850
gives you information about your speed

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:31,070
and fuel levels the other module is the

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,739
internal dashboard module the internal

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,900
dashboard module provides internal car

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:39,709
features the stuff that's inside our car

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:45,260
basically things like door locking seat

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:48,620
adjustment and climate control so here

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,459
is a small demo of mycroft with the

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,459
dashboard

00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,120
the left door with the block he might

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,120
fall

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,829
Saturday's forecast is 26 for a high and

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:26,960
25 for a low Sunday's forecast is 26 for

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:29,330
a high and 25 for a low on Monday expect

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,050
moderate rain with a high of 28 and a

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,050
low of 28

00:04:49,430 --> 00:05:01,310
a my first lock the left or the left

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:07,250
door has the watch him Mycroft unlock

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:14,750
the trunk the trunk didn't watch him

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:20,090
Mycroft unlock the hood he Mycroft turn

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,960
on the headlights so now will be single

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:29,740
internal dashboard mo hey Mycroft

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:33,919
increase the left seat pitch him Mycroft

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:38,320
decrease the right seat pitch right seat

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,389
has been decreased name Mycroft

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,419
increased the air conditioning the air

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:48,760
shaft has increased

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:53,720
hey Mycroft increased the steer height

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,370
hearing we adjusted so that was the

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,349
dashboard demo of how Mycroft could

00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,950
control our dashboard infotainment

00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,950
system

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:11,440
so the second module is the navigations

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,610
module this module is basically what

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,820
generally normal cars would have with

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,830
GPS system previously nowadays the new

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,350
cars have it built into their smart and

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,530
put in systems so navigation is also

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,690
awesome the module that provides mapping

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,790
provides current location it also

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,100
provides direction and exploration of

00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,950
nearby places some of the features of

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,420
this navigation system that has been

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,780
built into this infotainment system

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,670
currently has it allows you to explore

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,410
places or interest you know by could be

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,750
restaurants could be bars could be parks

00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,550
could be anything

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,900
location auto-completion so once you if

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,030
you have on-screen keyboard and you

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,860
start typing in the search bar and

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,260
address it should not you should be able

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,320
to autocomplete the address it also

00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,780
gives you turn by turn directions and

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:08,600
supports different map styles like night

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:17,380
terrain etc so this is a demo of locate

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:22,210
restaurants near me he Mycroft

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,210
navigate to Arthur Road Mumbai

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,759
showing markets or whatever is not that

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:43,430
yeah you can die action button to see

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:45,050
their directions so this is the map

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,719
style this is the edition feature that I

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,080
was talking about you can change the map

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:55,370
to go whichever what you want night mode

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,259
if you want a doc and this is V though

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,870
autocomplete feature so once you start

00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:03,740
typing it should start showing different

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:08,139
kind addresses that things you're typing

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,139
so I typed in the address of this

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,139
University

00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:17,869
and I also tried getting directions so

00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:20,619
about in 350 or 340 or directions I can

00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:23,949
actually drive down from India to this

00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,949
University somehow

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:35,380
so moving on to the next module is the

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,200
entertainment module the entry module

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,780
basically has two things one is the

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,330
radio player and one is the music Leo

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,400
now the radio player and music player

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,420
have complete voice control integration

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,750
with Mycroft additionally because

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,150
Mycroft can type into online services so

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,360
it was easy to have add online services

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:01,200
like the SoundCloud API to get music

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,700
from SoundCloud into your car and

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,830
support it also supports local media

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,360
another thing was that when you're using

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,950
entertainment dashboard you don't want

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,170
to have the music screen all the time on

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,640
so so you would want to have your

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,230
dashboard screen on you can still have

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,400
your music player playing you know many

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:22,920
of you on dashboard so here's a demo of

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,920
the music module first the radio play a

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,290
Mycroft turn on the radio

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:39,290
[Music]

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,290
a Mycroft June to fixate news

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,449
he mycroft doing off the radio

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:08,949
now the music there hey Mycroft such

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,949
stout cloud for gorillas

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,910
hey Mycroft plays a song Clint Eastwood

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,740
here Mycroft show dashboard

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,550
so this is the many view of the music

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,550
player radio system

00:10:52,180 --> 00:11:05,450
hey Mycroft pause the current song demo

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,210
of the music module moving on the

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:11,390
roadmap ahead of the smart Anton just

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,370
open source infotainment system would be

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,230
is to connect it up with actual

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,510
middleware such as the smart car API

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,610
that provides a control layer between

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,380
the hardware and software from multiple

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,120
car brands currently supports around 14

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,380
car brands so there will be integration

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,110
for that because it's a free API and

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,820
there we roadmap is add additional

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,130
controls in center sends a notification

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,410
support for things like seatbelt

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,560
detection for that New Testament

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,060
hardware and move this project to carry

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,390
playground it currently is in the

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:50,830
scratch or positi but plan smooth carry

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,830
pyro thank you questions

00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:07,680
thank you any questions thank you um I

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,470
was curious about the license of this

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,500
project if it is open-source and if you

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,160
have a link about it yeah it is

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,280
open-source

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,990
I I can give you the link on IRC it's

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,210
completely open source it's actually

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,420
it's in a scratch repository currently

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,160
in my k/d scratch repository and the

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,250
license is GPL

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,490
okay may I may I may ask Reid if I

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:38,400
needed if I need the link of the project

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:51,500
I couldn't share with you thank you any

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:55,080
more questions okay just a question on

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:59,880
which hardware does it work does it work

00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,520
for example Raspberry Pi yeah so so

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,790
currently I've tested this on the pine

00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,590
at 64 Bowdoin and I think it's going to

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,240
be more targeted to any single board

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,130
computers that people can probably

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:19,290
attach the screen to and run themselves

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:24,630
in the car and are the functionalities

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:31,080
or I don't know turning up and down the

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:33,930
windows working do we work with the obd

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,600
protocol so from what I understand

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,710
that's where I'm just we know right now

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,390
it's currently what you're seeing is

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,490
only the UI interface and the voice

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,750
interface the integration with the

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,060
hardware side that's what I was

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,700
depending on the smart API is not quite

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,130
a P I for that has this abstraction

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,380
layer between hardware and you okay

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,730
thank you

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,730
any more questions

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,560
have you been talking with any car

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,540
manufacturers as well or just a smart

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:17,100
car yes okay okay

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm sure they'll be interested in yeah

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,530
so since I was closer sorry the tests

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,560
might have support this kind of

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:29,540
conversational interface like you could

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,580
you have these examples that for example

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,370
tilt to see but can you say that after

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,380
tilt more all I like continued on the

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,840
same or is it always like a new command

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,740
in do you know so there is a

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,720
conversational interface it's just it's

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,150
just one of the things on the roadmap

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,530
that I have to do is combine things like

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:55,280
multiple actions and have a context my

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,750
graph does keep that in the background

00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:02,490
question here

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:05,880
are you planning to focus on the UI and

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:08,910
micros microf integration only you are

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,970
going to go for the HMI tooing embed the

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:15,570
logic of a car into the UI you are

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,910
planning also what is your strategy

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,790
towards the distribution that you want

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,290
to put this place this on because

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:26,520
depending on your thoughts about it then

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:29,400
the project is small or big or huge I'm

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,110
just trying to cement Lee since it's a

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,910
single developer project and I'm just

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,370
continue working on this and I'm working

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,470
on other projects of my craft so for me

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,490
right now the mean and I mean idea was

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,490
to do the UI and

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,800
before moving on to the hardware side of

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,510
it

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,420
on the hardware side I'm looking at

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,310
currently at API is that already exist

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,579
that I can tie into for the hardware

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,470
rather than writing hardware stuff so

00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,200
your your main focus is then the

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,870
integration between microphone the UI

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:09,990
finally if I understand correctly yes

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:13,890
the UI and mycroft okay any more

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,360
questions anyone okay thank you a good

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:22,110
day

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,110
