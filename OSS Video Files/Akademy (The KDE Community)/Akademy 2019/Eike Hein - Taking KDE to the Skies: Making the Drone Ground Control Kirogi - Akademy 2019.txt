Title: Eike Hein - Taking KDE to the Skies: Making the Drone Ground Control Kirogi - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Started in 2019, the Kirogi project is KDE's application to operate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - drones. Kirogi is breaking new ground: It exists in an entirely new application category for the KDE community, is the first open source UAV ground control intended for the end-user, and is one of the first KDE applications developed from scratch for a chiefly mobile audience, while also being available for desktop systems.

This talk will provide a quick introduction into the domain of UAVs and the software for them. Then, it will cover in detail the process and challenges of developing a complex mobile-first application based on KDE technologies - both the implementation and working with many institutions inside the community to affect needed library and tooling changes, for example for deployment to Android devices. An aside details the journey of utilizing the art community around KDE's Krita to commission artwork for the application.

The extensibility of the Kirogi application is discussed, i.e. its library and plugin interfaces for expanding vehicle/vendor support, and what it could mean for the consumer and DIY drone market.

This talk is for both the old and new in the audience. If you're curious what the process of bootstrapping an all-new KDE application in 2019 looks like, for insight or to take stock, or if you'd simply like to know more about cool computers that fly, drop by.

	00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,420
thank you so much for coming my name is

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,639
iCup as you said I'm very excited today

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,389
to show you something I've been working

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,090
on for a few months

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,940
it's a brand new KD application it's

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,039
called ki doggy and don't vary by the

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,500
end of the talk you will also know what

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,050
the name means I'll start things off

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,789
though by quoting the one sentence

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,800
description of the application that is

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,170
you know in the desktop file and shows

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,510
up in your menu which is that Keowee is

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,180
a round control application for drones

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,790
and I want to tell you what each of the

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,860
constituents in that sentence mean so

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,469
first of all drones these are the drones

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,170
that the application currently supports

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,910
some of them are here on the desk this

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,190
is standard consumer grade hardware

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,370
discuss the chicken head things always

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,500
fun to demo you can buy these relatively

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,230
easily in retail stores you can buy them

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,870
online they're not that expensive one

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,210
kind of important takeaway here is that

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,400
these are by different manufacturers so

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,630
the application is limited to supporting

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,820
one brand of drones it can support

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:15,140
hopefully in the future all of them now

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,549
what is the ground control this is a

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,049
schematic drawing of a drone software

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,780
system which has two principal

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,960
components thanks to xkcd for that I'd

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,670
work on the drone itself the software

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,920
running there is known as the pilot

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,960
that's because it controls the vehicle

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,930
controls its control surfaces

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,710
it makes the motors spin up at varying

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,900
speeds and the operator on the ground is

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,079
using the ground control to send

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,409
commands to the pilot these can be very

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,720
simple and direct commands like I left

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,670
by right fly upside down they can also

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,430
be more complicated they can be more

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,860
high level for example fly relative five

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,079
meters or fly to a particular GPS

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,759
coordinate depending on the capabilities

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,890
of the pilot and the hardware now a

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,259
little bit about drone piloting like

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,840
sort of any sort of aircraft a drone a

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,990
multicopter as it's called can roll

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,660
around these three axes they

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,330
from a fixed-wing aircraft multicopter

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,980
can change direction without turning

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,050
which is pretty cool

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,030
direction has changed by tilting the

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,770
vehicle in a particular direction so you

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,960
don't need to turn it around if you want

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,000
to fly backwards necessarily which means

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,190
the camera and Franck can look at the

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,350
point of interest regardless of the

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,390
vehicle orientation and also different

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,070
from a fixed-wing aircraft can directly

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,800
move up and down now it's already time

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,570
to demo the application and show you

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,310
what it looked like don't worry I'm not

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,200
going to attempt to fly drones in this

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,860
room this would risk giving a whole new

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,540
meaning to crashing the demo so I'm not

00:02:52,860 --> 00:03:00,480
going to do that alright it does come up

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,800
nice so this is the welcome screen all

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,390
of this is you know a little bit

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,120
programme' hard and might need some help

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,520
from the vdg to make this prettier but

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,500
on this screen you end up selecting your

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,200
brand of drone either using this button

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,270
here at the bottom or over here you can

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,460
change that selection later on it will

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,550
also remember it for you if the app

00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,290
quits while you're flying it will try to

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,020
get you back to where you left off as

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,290
fast as possible in this case I'm going

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,480
to connect to parrot drones which will

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,920
now discover and connect to you and show

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,100
you a little bit about it it's the

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,320
flight checklist where you can check if

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,110
your vehicle is ready to fly and then

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:46,740
jump into flight controls now you can

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:48,450
see yourself in the back you have in the

00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,640
back you have the video feed from the

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,980
drone as you can see there's a virtual

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,770
horizon which you know shows some of

00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:02,540
these excitations over here in the upper

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,580
left corner you have air speed altitude

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,890
distance to the ground control on the

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,360
right you have your flight time which is

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,040
really important especially in

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,780
connection with the battery status of

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,510
the vehicle you want to keep track of

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,130
that you want to know low know how long

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,920
you've been flying and how that is

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,140
having an impact on your battery life so

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,600
you know how much time you have roughly

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,670
left and the signal strengths of the

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,690
vehicle not

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:33,660
at the bottom right you can have some

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,370
amount of control over if you want to

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,920
record a video or a still picture and

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,070
you know make a shot in the future there

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,050
will be many more controls of that kind

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,180
these things are kind of flying cameras

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,990
so the screen will ended up being kind

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,090
of a camera up with d-pads

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,460
speaking of those d-pads on the left

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,930
this is multi-touch unfortunately you

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,180
know I can't touch the projector screen

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,460
but I will show you the app running on

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,110
mobile phone very shortly and then we

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:07,410
can attach those on the Left vertical

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,230
up-down turning the vehicle on the

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,000
horizontal axis over there we could tilt

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,880
which makes it fly in a particular

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,060
direction now I want to open the side

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,540
bar where a lot of other stuff is not

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,800
necessarily buried but can be found

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,800
there you can find various vehicle

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,870
actions one fun thing to do is flip the

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,920
vehicle these are currently disabled I

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,810
haven't implemented that on this

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,330
particular model but you can flip in any

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,240
sort of direction geofence

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,970
which allows you to confine the vehicle

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,590
to a particular area and maximum

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,810
altitude and distance from the ground

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,570
control so it doesn't you know run away

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,980
from you and various performance

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,780
settings over here on the lower left

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,170
there are some presets that you can use

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,820
to switch all these settings faster if

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,440
you're trying to record a stable video

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,630
you probably don't want to be equal to

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,640
act very sort of twitchy which is what

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:07,380
the film preset is for which it was very

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,710
low very low values but these things are

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,230
pretty fast this can go like 50 km/h so

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,590
you can revved it up and can have a lot

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,950
more fun with it and sort of fly a bit

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,450
more athletically if you wish I will

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,970
move one of those you can see it shows

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,760
the current value as as a line there and

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:30,050
only when you release it will tell the

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,860
vehicle to assume that and then sync up

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,270
all right yeah this is not the only

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,650
screen of the application let me open

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:43,620
the menu I can find my pointer here yeah

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,990
next important page is the navigation

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,520
map this is quite bare-bones right now

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,380
and this is a bit shake data and don't

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,300
have a GPS sticks in here but this is

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,920
our current location and let's just

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,680
pretend the drone is flying out there

00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,050
right now this allows you to see where

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,810
you are where the vehicle is it allows

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,630
you to fly the vehicle also to a spot on

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,400
the map by just tapping again this is

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,960
very bare-bones right now however this

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,740
part of the application will probably

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,510
see most of the expansion in the future

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,050
allowing mission planning setting bait

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,420
points allowing the application to fly a

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,570
pre-program path that's where the

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:24,420
autonomous comes in right and finally we

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,820
also have an about screen where you can

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,480
see my collaborators and I will tell you

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:34,110
more about them shortly now let's switch

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,670
back to this video feed and in Syria

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,870
could like use a cameraman right now

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:45,170
what I'll try to do is myself and my

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:48,900
phone here let's see alright

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:51,360
Oh actually okay maybe I can like

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,840
position this a bit stable here and do

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
it from over here

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,050
I'm sure good enough let's jump into

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,830
that other drone that is on the table

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,350
there yeah yeah these things are you so

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,990
even if they're not flying you can see

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,880
this multi-touch it jumps to your touch

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,370
initial touch position so it sort of

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,500
adjusts in your hand size whatever that

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,920
may be and then you just move around I

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,260
did disable the take-off button at the

00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,730
top for demo mode it's a bit scary to

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,950
carry these around especially it's like

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,230
a Samsung curved display and then you

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,760
accidentally take off so I need to

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,010
implement something nicer there like

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,280
slide to slide you fly or something like

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,990
that so this is really a mobile first

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,450
application because of course if you're

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,710
out and about with your drone you

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,680
probably don't want to carry a heavy

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:46,200
thing pad around although you will see I

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,030
also did this at some point because

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,030
since I can't fly it in the room here I

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,360
recorded a little video of some like

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,250
significant development

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,250
stance which I'm going to show you

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:08,199
all right so I started hacking in in

00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:09,670
February of this year and the first

00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:13,690
thing I tried to do was get the video

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,639
feed from the vehicle and that's its

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:20,380
video section already so that's pretty

00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:22,600
fun and then about ten days later I had

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,149
enough of the like protocol implemented

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,010
to get some telemetry from the vehicle

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,500
so this is not the drone flying this is

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,139
me picking the drone up but you can see

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,240
the virtual ricin is doing things I was

00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,980
getting UDP packets from the vehicle and

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,680
you know decoding them and all of that

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:42,310
stuff and so I could talk to my drone

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,529
for the first time and then I did the

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,630
first flight now you have to know that

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,750
the city I live in in South Korea is a

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,820
no-fly zone so it's not really allowed

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,779
to go fly there so I did it at night at

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,810
likes you am also also because only by

00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:02,320
CI mi actually had it working and went

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,570
to sort of my back yard and sat on the

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,889
ground with a sink pad the flickering is

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,959
due to the way I did the video capture

00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,060
no worries and you can see I had the

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,949
back there I reversed the axis on the

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,839
d-pad so I'm pulling it back but it's

00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:17,260
flagged forward but you know I was happy

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:22,930
it worked after like lots of ninja bug

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,000
fixing and then two weeks later the tree

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,769
honest by far most painful part of

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,199
development was making it work on

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:33,120
Android I'll tell you a little bit more

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:38,740
about why later yeah this is on my phone

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,019
connecting and it's cool and this is me

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,579
flying now the other thing you need to

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,040
know is that I spent most of my time

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:47,889
hacking so I'm a terrible pilot and this

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,350
is very precarious and I did fly into my

00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:54,670
TV I did fly into my wallpaper it is

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,360
like cough marks there but yeah it's so

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,380
it's scary

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:05,290
don't do this at home why'd it work so

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:06,970
again I was very happy and finally I did

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,640
some field testing I went to a satellite

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,670
city of Co where that is outside the

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,330
no-fly zone and had some fun for the

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,160
first time and

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,899
laughter I do a turnabout you can see

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,839
one of those flip actions I showed you

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:26,830
earlier you know in action which is

00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,120
always fun to look at I have a still

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,910
picture from this we had looked like a

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,850
selfie from the drone just which is fun

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:40,089
it's one of the use cases for these to

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:46,029
take really cool selfies woo our drones

00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:47,500
are fun and this slightly hurling it was

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,330
very windy you can see it sort of shake

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,220
in the wind but it's pretty good at

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:55,779
holding position actually all right now

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,240
why did I make this

00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:00,130
most of you in this room are probably

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,720
familiar with one of the like founding

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,270
stories of the whole open-source

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,830
movement which is Richard Stallman being

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,510
very angry at the printer driver he

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,800
couldn't get Swiss code to to make that

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,500
printer work with his system

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,540
it turns out this app has a almost

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,760
similar sort of origin story

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,500
I bought this drone in February when I

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,260
was visiting my parents-in-law

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,240
down in Tucson a coastal city which is I

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,240
was so outside of the seals no-fly zone

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,520
so you can buy lots of drones there and

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,380
electronic stores and so I bought this

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,089
drone and none the wiser

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,709
I of course tried to fly it for the

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,899
first time in my mother-in-law's living

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,300
room so it was hanging there making a

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,550
lot of wind and noise and I couldn't

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,959
land it because the application the

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,110
official application that came with the

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,779
drone immediately crashed now and I

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,459
reopen it again immediately crash now

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,470
why is that it turns out that

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:52,660
manufacturer I had since then released a

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,850
new a drone made a new major version of

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,640
the application uploaded it separately

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,820
to the Play Store stopped updating the

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,700
old app new version of Android came out

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,950
things broke it crashes so I was like

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,730
this probably should be open-source this

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,920
is a bit crappy and wrote my own so I

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,959
think it's a sort of classic free

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,550
software use case most of the

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,950
proprietary apps are either single

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,350
vendor or even single drone this app

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:24,490
works with multiple models so multiple

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,230
different up like Wenders and those

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,080
propriety vendors they often sort of

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,570
abandon their old apps

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,480
when they bring out a new drone so this

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,130
can give new life to your drone and

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,660
allow you to use the same software

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,000
across sort of your fleet of vehicles

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,740
and I think it can

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,500
in the end just serve users better to

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,260
have an open-source app like this I also

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,150
personally wanted to learn how to make a

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,510
Katy mobile app I had never done that I

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,940
wanted to know what's the status of that

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,640
it works so I'm pretty happy with the

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,470
outcome and Jones are just sound these

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,930
are like flying computers they little

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,420
air M devices you can adb shell into

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,960
them and you can hack around there it's

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,150
really cool so let me give you a little

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,670
bit of overview over the application

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:14,460
it's of course written in C++ and qml

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,350
and it heavily relies on kirigami for

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,950
the UI which makes it work really well

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:23,460
across the desktop and mobile it's

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,200
almost sort of a pure KDE app to the

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,760
extent that still means something

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,230
because you know very intentionally we

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,600
pushed a lot of things upstream into

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,700
queued and so on over the years but the

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,520
only dependencies it has that aren't

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,030
part of either cubes or frameworks are

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,620
gstreamer which are use for video and

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,600
shout-out to those guys they were

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,610
incredibly helpful on the IRC channel

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,550
and it's the only thing I found that

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,470
works very well across Android and

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:54,000
desktop with hardware acceleration so

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,890
really great stuff there and I use the

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,810
third-party library for dynamic DNS

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,300
which is used for vehicle discovery on a

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,940
network called zero comp we have a

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,860
framework for that called kdn SSD but

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,260
unfortunately it doesn't work on Android

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,140
yet this could be something of interest

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,390
to Fokker I guess and I think it's not

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,940
that hard to change hopefully we can get

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,750
that done and then it will basically be

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,540
cute

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,330
pure cute and frameworks and since it's

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,880
a recently written app I try to use no

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,260
deprecated API or try to give a spin to

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,590
some new acute features like input

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,590
Enders

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:33,090
I will not go into these boxes in too

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,000
much detail but the main takeaways from

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,220
the software architecture is that the

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,190
application UI use the shared back-end

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,790
library this has public API is in C++

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,160
and humor

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,560
so you can write your own application

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,910
using this library and you don't have to

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
write all the code of talking to

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,170
vehicles again

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,570
the library intern loads support for

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:58,890
vehicles of a particular type or

00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:00,810
manufacturer from plugins the plugin

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,930
interface is also public so you can

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:08,220
develop your own standalone dragon and

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:11,220
get it in there all right now an

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,980
interesting thing specific to KDE mobile

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,740
apps on Android one of the things that I

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,660
hear a lot is well this must be like

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,490
roughly inefficient and bloated compared

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,110
to a native app because you need to

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,420
bundle cute in there you need to bundle

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:29,040
frameworks in there isn't it going to be

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,570
a huge download but it turns out that as

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,590
far as I can tell they're actually

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,560
pretty competitive

00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,660
these are download sizes for two of the

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,190
most popular proprietary apps these

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,930
drones are made by parrot they have

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,760
their own app which is very well done

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,130
but a little bit bigger than Karogi and

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,870
DJI is the market leader for consumer

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,850
drones and their app is really pretty

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,580
hefty now those apps currently do have

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,830
more features than karoge does but a lot

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,500
of that comes down to code more than

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,450
assets and I think as you know

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,610
corroboree picks up speed and and gain

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,560
some of those features will stay pretty

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,620
competitive on the on the download size

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,829
front there now you've seen it all along

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,540
with my t-shirt I think so I live in I

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,250
live in South Korea and in South Korea

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,650
its thing is not a thing until it has a

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:19,400
cute mascot so I knew I wanted to have

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:22,860
one I'll tell you about the mascot so

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,699
both these are actually some of the you

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,740
know most competent Birds there are when

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,520
it comes to flying they are the like

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,850
second fastest animal on the planet

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,520
however the mascot the Corgi is by the

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,840
farm goons and however flies even better

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,630
thanks to superior KD technology so it's

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,460
early adopter right there

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,250
one of our best users and of course

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,140
Quiroga is the Korean word for walkies I

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,809
lived there I wanted you know have a new

00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:00,600
K name I still like canings

00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:02,490
and and that works so a really cool

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,909
thing about this mascot is that it was

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,220
actually done in Krita so we have the KT

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:10,950
forums the KT forum secretor have an

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,570
artist wanted section I had an idea for

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,870
this character and I made the poster

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,230
looking for artists I God immediately

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:21,539
within like the next 24 hours about half

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,970
a dozen really great submissions I had a

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,370
really hard time picking who I wanted to

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,080
work with from like excellent portfolios

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,990
I ended up working together with a

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,379
French second-year art student Lilly

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,249
charlie

00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:37,289
and I tremendously enjoyed working with

00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:41,970
her she was incredibly professional and

00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:44,399
talented and within weeks we had we went

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,700
from from the initial idea through some

00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:49,590
sketches which I can show you to the

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,559
final result she did a whole number of

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:57,950
poses that every turn she should let me

00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:00,029
pick my favorite and she endured all my

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,159
lengthy communication about the

00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:04,169
licensing requirements to be able to you

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,749
know we distribute her artwork and she

00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:08,009
was really interested in sort of giving

00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,980
back to the critter community and

00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:12,480
helping me with that so yeah I was

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,110
really amazing she did some additional

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,210
sketches form forehead poses that

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:21,509
Raphael and Maya from the vdg did the

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,669
application icon based on and yeah so

00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:27,419
that's really great I'm amazed by the

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,980
scope of the katy community that I think

00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,860
takes dog fooding

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,690
to like a whole new level that we have a

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,149
painting app that you can use to make

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:41,820
hard work for Katie products just wait

00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:44,580
so how did the project go so far what

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,799
went really well so the community is

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,379
super amazing believe it or not I've

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,450
been a KD developer since 2005 but this

00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:54,059
is the first project that I ever started

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,369
from scratch I've worked on apps before

00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,820
I've maintained apps before but I didn't

00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:01,919
start them so it was fun to have a whole

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,740
new experience what is it like in KDE to

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,860
start a whole new app and I got so much

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,490
support both people putting in effort

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,640
putting in

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,710
work but also just cheering me on

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,690
sharing the enthusiasm for what I was

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,910
doing and was really easy to stay

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,760
motivated even as I was you know

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:24,300
struggling with some of the tech they're

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:26,580
great the tooling is comprehensive those

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,450
points kind of work hand in hand we have

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,640
an really great Android SDK docker image

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:34,740
that you can use to sort of dev on

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,380
Android apps locally and that if then

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,140
also use by our CI system to make to

00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:44,429
make builds and ilish did a lot of that

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,530
and helped me a lot nightly session so

00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:49,380
that's really fun so thank you for that

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,240
and you know as I said we have these

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,580
great content creation apps I also

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,320
edited that home video earlier using

00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:00,120
kdenlive just the scope is just amazing

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,860
the conclusion of you know trying to

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,290
learn to make Katie mobile apps is that

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm pretty happy with it it worked out

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,620
really well

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,170
however Android is a little bit

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,960
frustrating most of that is down to the

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,730
platform I think you know making my

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,210
first Android app I guess that's to be

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,760
expected

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,460
but it was a really steep learning curve

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,260
there's lots of quarters at some point I

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,840
had a lip kuroky but it turns out that

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,690
on Android the main binary gets turned

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,000
into lip name of your executables so I

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,910
had a naming conflict there and got no

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,230
good errors about that so you know lots

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,590
of questions like that

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,450
I think documenting those or you know

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,309
automating some of those away could help

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:45,660
there you know make our community more

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:49,290
performant that putting more of our apps

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,809
on Android also maybe some helpers like

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,880
using our SVG icons as is instead of

00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:57,510
turning them into androids proprietary

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,490
XML format and I really hate lock cat I

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:04,710
still don't know how to like filter

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:06,000
Sudeep messages effectively but overall

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,220
goes it was ok

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,610
as you saw it took me about 2 weeks to

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,770
figure it all out I would really love

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,720
with more frameworks modules get Android

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:19,559
ports I really look forward to focus

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,670
talk on that later Katie and SD as I

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:26,790
mentioned is the on top of my wish list

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:28,680
now last but not least future plans I

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,800
have not made a stable release of the

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,650
application yet it's already working

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,780
quite well but I want to sort of polish

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,330
it up a bit more and and then slap a

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,740
tack on that and figure out how to get

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,610
it on the Playstore and the kidneys

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,860
account and as I mentioned earlier the

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:51,170
navigation map will see a lot of new

00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:54,690
features mission planning waypoints

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:57,630
survey tools that kind of thing and I'm

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,430
very curious if I can switch from from

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,560
cute location key positioning there to

00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,750
marble because marble does have a lot of

00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,990
useful tools to put stuff on top of the

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,210
map it even has an Android port it even

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,680
has a cute crypto API but it's currently

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,450
disabled in the build system I guess

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,180
they're not really happy with supporting

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,680
that yet I'm hoping to find someone from

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,410
the Marvel team at the conference later

00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,690
this week to talk about that and figure

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:26,780
out how we maybe can help each other

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,640
lots of stuff to do on the media side

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,290
this has like camera gimbal which you

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,150
know there's video stabilization but can

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:36,570
also be manually controlled so I want to

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,370
have something in the UI for that you

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,940
need to be able to download the media

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,470
you record from the device in the case

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,960
of these drones there's actually an FTP

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,600
server running on them so ki o can do

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,730
that I just need to slap a UI on it and

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,280
the gallery to browse the stuff recorded

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,070
as well as the ability to record streams

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,230
locally now there are these

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,360
consumer-grade loans which use

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,190
proprietary protocols two of which I've

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,560
implemented so far but there's also

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,080
great enthusiasts open-source community

00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,820
around do-it-yourself drones and they've

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,380
developed some some open-source

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,470
protocols which I'm of course like

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,120
really keen to support in this project

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,580
the most well-known is madelung there's

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,070
also the multi V serial protocol from

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,730
the other arduino community I hope to

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,990
have plugins for those relatively soon

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,960
Tomas if he's in the room has been

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,970
hacking away on am a flame plugin

00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,380
already I look forward to talking to you

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:36,390
about it fpv first-person video one of

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,880
the most popular ways to flight

00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:42,270
is with video goggles strapped to your

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,150
head I want to learn more about that and

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:48,660
figure out how to make UI mode optimized

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,580
to that maybe the preceding speaker can

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,370
help me with that

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,230
yeah if you want to find out more about

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,570
the application or if you want to

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:01,559
download the nightly build the website

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:04,380
currently has Android builds 64-bit and

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,270
32-bit and it has flat pack for desktop

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,870
Linux you can grab those check them out

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:12,200
and if you have any other questions find

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,260
me if you want to look at those drones

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,450
walk over to the table after the talk

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:27,069
yeah thank you

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:27,069
