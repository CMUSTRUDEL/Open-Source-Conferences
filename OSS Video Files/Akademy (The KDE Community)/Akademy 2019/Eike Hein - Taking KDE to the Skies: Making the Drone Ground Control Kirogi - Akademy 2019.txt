Title: Eike Hein - Taking KDE to the Skies: Making the Drone Ground Control Kirogi - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Started in 2019, the Kirogi project is KDE's application to operate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - drones. Kirogi is breaking new ground: It exists in an entirely new application category for the KDE community, is the first open source UAV ground control intended for the end-user, and is one of the first KDE applications developed from scratch for a chiefly mobile audience, while also being available for desktop systems.

This talk will provide a quick introduction into the domain of UAVs and the software for them. Then, it will cover in detail the process and challenges of developing a complex mobile-first application based on KDE technologies - both the implementation and working with many institutions inside the community to affect needed library and tooling changes, for example for deployment to Android devices. An aside details the journey of utilizing the art community around KDE's Krita to commission artwork for the application.

The extensibility of the Kirogi application is discussed, i.e. its library and plugin interfaces for expanding vehicle/vendor support, and what it could mean for the consumer and DIY drone market.

This talk is for both the old and new in the audience. If you're curious what the process of bootstrapping an all-new KDE application in 2019 looks like, for insight or to take stock, or if you'd simply like to know more about cool computers that fly, drop by.
