Title: Aleix Pol Gonzalez - Organising a KDE Sprint - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Meeting in person and interacting is an opportunity and a privilege we have thanks to our sponsors and donors.
I'd like to explain how the process usually works to make sure the community is aware and feels empowered to organise them.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,080
all right I just had to do this talk

00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:09,150
because at some point I realized that I

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,969
was organizing most of the sprints and I

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,980
thought it's maybe because it's either

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,470
too hard or because people don't care

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,460
and since I preferred it would be the

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:26,039
first option I decided that I thought

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:28,199
would make it so much easy so when I

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,449
think it was it was around the time I

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,870
was starting ad so I cannot really put

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,840
the pointing the in history but it was

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,969
around twenty two thousand six or seven

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,649
that kdv decided that sprinting or

00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,120
organising developer and contributor

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:52,980
many meetings was a way to put money to

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,610
use to improving KT software and well

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,550
Kitty has been having sprint so far but

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,430
lots of them are well first of all I am

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,780
a leash I'm part of the KDP board and

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:11,490
I've been developing KT software since

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:13,409
2007 or so for now what you need to see

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,759
is that I organized several sprints by

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:22,560
now if you say either I'm somewhere

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,590
where I think that a sprint could happen

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,920
or I am part of a team that needs to

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,340
well meet physically you will want to

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,470
think about organizing a sprint right

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,500
basically and the big TL DR is that you

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,509
need to think about where right the big

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,640
special thing about okay this print is

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:47,700
that well G of geographical space comes

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,180
into question otherwise our software

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,030
like gets developed all over the world

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,830
I put Huck here but in general like it

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,890
wouldn't even need developing right like

00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,050
if you have develop contributors who

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,480
need to gather and do stuff beat

00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,940
developing I like writing code or I

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,429
don't know documenting or I don't know

00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,470
whatever that that makes sense we've had

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,960
documentation sprints we've had promo

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,850
sprints we've had different kind of

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,070
stuff I wouldn't know if documenting

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,700
would count as hacking but I'm not a

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:26,040
linguist if anybody is a linguist tell

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:28,590
me it does sure then see hack and sleep

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,650
and one would think that people don't

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,810
sleep and I mean admittedly on a sprint

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,390
you wouldn't sleep that much but you

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,800
need to do think about that now the

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,110
third thing would be food but well it's

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,370
something that you end up worrying more

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,959
when when you are there done actually

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:58,250
from well when you're preparing the

00:02:48,959 --> 00:03:03,810
sprint right the GDP will be sponsoring

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:07,290
trips so flights or train or cars or I

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:14,239
don't know donkeys and will be

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:16,920
sponsoring the the sleep right so hotel

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,690
flats or whatever it's ands Luton

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,250
looking like like we've had very

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,890
different kind of Sprint's we used to

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,780
have for example Ronda which was

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,420
admittedly something very special and

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,190
specific but it was like renting a big

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,040
house and bringing tons of Sprint's over

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,880
there we've had Sprint's where we just

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,299
hired the house and well we slept there

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,690
and hug there just in different times of

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,760
the day we've had

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,580
Sprint's which is actually probably the

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,110
most common which is there is a company

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,870
that is somewhat interested in what we

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,820
do and they tell us we can go there we

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,880
obviously don't go to people's office

00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,570
just to sleep to sleep so while we find

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,620
a hotel or flat or whatever nearby and

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,620
what we

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:15,870
so kdv will be sponsoring this and and

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:18,150
trips food is not sponsored but I mean

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,650
people will be still having food you

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,120
just need to think or make sure that

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,330
there's more or less restaurants around

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,240
the area or I mean for example in Brenda

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,460
we didn't go to restaurants we managed

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,470
that so it's it's a matter of of having

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,520
a plan of what are you gonna do when

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,720
people start starving and being cranky

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,200
that's always useful

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,240
so yeah food and in general the process

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,580
would be you get in touch with the

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,120
different people who want to meet and

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,010
see right who would come where are you

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,600
coming from because obviously the budget

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,140
will look very differently if you have

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,020
people coming from very different places

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,520
or they're just around the area when we

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,310
were starting KD connect for example

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,720
when we met with with Albert who is also

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,890
living in Barcelona we were joking that

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,990
we're having a Katie connect screen

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,700
right because I mean we were meeting and

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,400
we were kind of the two people doing

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,410
stuff in KDE connect back man so I mean

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,300
that was a sprain right we were

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,970
obviously not asking permission to the

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,280
Ivry to to do these kind of meetings but

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,890
if you have people from all over the

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,270
world you will want to find the place

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,250
for example that is in the meeting in

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,070
the middle so I mean it's not a matter

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,070
of like destroying the planet by flying

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,020
just as far away as possible if a lot of

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,390
people wants to meet I don't know in

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,290
India in Asia because they're there

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,850
that's definitely doable in in Brazil

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,620
for example they do Alec Adam II which

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,240
is I mean more than Academy it's more it

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,130
looks more like a sprain I've never been

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,980
there but I've looked at the picture

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,720
pictures very closely and yeah in

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,260
general so you will talk to the board

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,780
they will say we will need about 5,000

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,960
euros for this print or ten thousand or

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,860
three million and then what we will look

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,990
at our budgets on our and see if it fits

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,570
if it can be due I'm done if it's too

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,990
high we'll say why is it so high it's

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,120
not

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,699
they just go for it we will create an

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,150
entry in reimbursements that orchid org

00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:27,330
which basically is an event and then

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,960
when you tell your fellow contributors

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,090
or sprint attendees register to

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,910
reimbursement then there they will be

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,599
inputting the right amounts it will be

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,300
accounted into a specific budget and the

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,940
board or an Albert who has been helping

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,770
us with that will be accepting the

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:52,800
people or saying if we need some more

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:54,300
information or not well we document all

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,699
of the sprints there you can actually

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,870
look at which Sprint's are happening in

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,630
in this wiki you can look into that and

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:09,750
I didn't really talk much about the

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:12,389
sleep but well you would find a hotel

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,530
what when I organized a sprint I'd like

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:19,500
to try to do it myself like you could

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,539
technically tell your attendees just go

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,259
to any hotel you find in that city and

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:28,229
get the room but well first people want

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,830
group together and a very interesting

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:34,349
way of economics is having people share

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,419
rooms because otherwise what you end up

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:40,080
getting a double room for every person

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:42,360
and it's just double the price and we're

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,469
not wasting donors money right so

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,330
there's that there's the flat Airbnb

00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:50,580
kind of formula as well you can look

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,320
into that when when we had the office in

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,259
Barcelona we were having a lot of

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,409
Sprint's over there and we knew a flood

00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:02,909
that was easily hireable for a week or

00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:04,800
so and well every time that somebody

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,090
said I would like to organize a sprint

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,340
in your office would that be possible

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,849
answer yeah sure I talked to the guy he

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,740
said would you have space that we get

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:17,250
sure and then this was super easy right

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,020
because well we already knew each other

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,659
I knew that the space was available what

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,380
it looked like there's always some kind

00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:29,000
of well variable right if you've never

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,000
been to the place so

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,919
there's that and then scaling I added

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,260
this because it happened twice this year

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,539
that I was organizing a sprint and then

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,860
somebody wanted to be there as well and

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,990
some of the essence for the else it

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,740
happened first in Valencia we started

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,510
organizing a plasma sprint and then Nate

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,050
was looking for a place to have a sprint

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,149
in and then we had the usability and

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,529
productivity sprint over there it works

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,089
out fine actually like all of the

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,300
results were just kind of done in that

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:03,350
case but as like for location we had the

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:08,029
Limbourg offices in in Valencia they had

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:10,160
space for more hackers so and also the

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:15,890
both subjects were kind of intertwined

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,510
so it made also semantic sense then it

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,300
was a matter of just getting more rooms

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,240
in the in the hotel and all increasing

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,750
the budget of course but well both

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,310
Sprint's needed a budget anyways same

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:34,399
happens with in the Nuremburg sprint in

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,769
you know but souza offices we started

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,760
doing a KDE connect sprint and then

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:42,920
there was no boarding spring that wanted

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,630
to or neither the space at all them all

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,550
right we can have it there we just get

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,209
some more rooms and then Quinn actually

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,339
said and we to me too all right and we

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:55,250
had the three of them in rumburk and it

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:59,839
worked out quite right but you can ask

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,910
them but I'd say it was ok one of the

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,800
things that you need to remember to tell

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,660
your attendees and you need to remove

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,980
yourself other than these is that prints

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:12,230
should ideally have a well I need

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,880
something on the news in that case or

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,190
explain what happened the kind of things

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,810
you did that that would that should be

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,320
there as well also we're asking

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,149
everybody sponsored in general also for

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,640
Academy so remember to write a blog post

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,709
or actually the dot story if somebody

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,810
says I'm not gonna write about my what I

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,220
did but what we all did that that's fine

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,440
as well but everybody should be

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,480
reporting on on the planet but what

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,480
they've been up to on the on Sprint and

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:58,140
that's about it if you have any

00:10:38,820 --> 00:11:01,110
questions here or around Academy so for

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,030
like almost 10 years ago we did an event

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,310
with genome and we are going to do that

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,490
again and you are one of the organizers

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,340
so how is organizing something together

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,180
it should be communities well that's not

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:21,960
as friend

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:24,420
it looks entirely different you need to

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,240
call it in 8 people from very different

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,490
backgrounds and that always takes some

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,590
kind of toll but on the other hand it's

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,320
brilliant to be able to work together

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,620
with another big community to be able to

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,430
do something well that is more than the

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:45,300
sum of its parts

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:48,990
right so it's gonna be great yes but

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,410
well come all of your welcome the

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,570
