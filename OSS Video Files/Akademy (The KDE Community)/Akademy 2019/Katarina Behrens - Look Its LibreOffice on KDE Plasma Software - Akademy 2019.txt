[Applause]

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,559
welcome ladies and gentlemen I hope you

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:15,839
enjoyed the lunch it would be much worse

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,890
to have a talk before lunch and so let's

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:29,760
talk about Libre Office on KDE plasma

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:32,219
this is my vanity slide yes my nickname

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,829
is bubbly I'm a Libra office developer

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,380
and I'm one of the people who brought

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,380
Libra office on Kady plasma to you

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,950
[Applause]

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:52,199
of course like no way I did or I would

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,230
be able to do all of this alone and all

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,109
those guys and girls worked on the

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,980
project as well they contributed the

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,460
code they tested reported trashed box

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,200
and actually very little of what I'm

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,340
going to talk about today would be

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,950
possible without them unfortunately I

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,710
don't think any of them is here but some

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,290
of them have their co-workers around I

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:27,960
see you Tobias so let's give them some

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:32,130
small round of applause before we start

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,220
thank you okay Libra office on KDE

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,409
plasma is there anybody in this room who

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:43,680
doesn't know what Libra office is never

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:46,049
heard of everybody sort of knows so yeah

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
just to just to reiterate it's the best

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,840
free and open source office suit out

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,810
there

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,509
I'm sorry caligra and I'm sorry apache

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,850
openoffice but it's just how it is the

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,479
document foundation is a non-profit

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:09,629
entity it's bit like a leaf foundation

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:12,360
and it's the entity behind libreoffice I

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,620
would also like to bring this the sister

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,840
project of liberal

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,080
which is a document liberation project

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,099
it is a set of import filters and

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,769
reverse engineering tools to import

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,730
documents from various ancient binary

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:33,420
proprietary formats and convert them to

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,299
open formats but it's a bit tangential

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,310
to the rest of the talk I just wanted

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:43,079
you people to know that this project

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,660
exists okay I like telling stories so

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:50,879
this is a brief history of Libre Office

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,250
on one slide it all started in 1984 some

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,700
of you have not been alive by the time

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,299
yet

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:02,609
wait bro dude whose name was Marco

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:05,480
burries he created a word processor a

00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:08,099
text processor for 8-bit computers and

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,989
in the course of time he built the

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,180
entire company around this word

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,180
processor and later added a spreadsheet

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,260
processor and the presentation tool and

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,000
the company's name was star division and

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:25,739
star division got acquired by Sun

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,650
Microsystems in 1999 allegedly it was

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,620
for Sun it was cheaper to buy the entire

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,519
company than to buy Microsoft Office

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,400
licenses for everybody but I think it's

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,879
just an urban legend

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:45,060
so as Star division got acquired by Sun

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,250
the project got renamed to open office

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,000
and it's for its first version got

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,730
released in 2002 and then the second

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,799
version and the third version and then

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:04,109
in 19 2009 our Sun was acquired by

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:07,379
Oracle and two years later what happened

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:10,199
is that Oracle discontinued support for

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,349
OpenOffice and light of all the

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,010
employees that were working on the open

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,049
office but even before this happened

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:23,789
some smaller group of open office

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:28,219
developers decided to somehow do away

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,219
with what they perceived as some sort

00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,810
alterative

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,780
or let's say dictatorship of Oracle and

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,669
decided two things their own way so they

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,470
forked the project and limit Libre

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:45,629
Office and two years after that finally

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,580
the nonprofit foundation supporting

00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:54,870
Libre Office and its development got

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:57,840
established as you perhaps know Libre

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,220
Office is a multi-platform software what

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,139
does it mean that it simply runs or is

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,319
better or worse integrated into

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,409
different operating systems and which

00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:13,319
operating systems are those so

00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:15,949
officially supported by document and

00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:20,400
released by document foundation is

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:22,560
Windows Mac OSX and Linux so if you had

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,650
had two Libre Office or core document

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,379
foundation org those binaries are the

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,680
ones for those operating systems either

00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,870
ones that you can download from from the

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,780
official page then there are of course

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,039
like multiple Linux distribution that

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,240
had built their own sugar coating or

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:46,229
remove the stuff they don't like

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,870
upstream and this is what you watch you

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,860
can watch what is shaped with your

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,229
favorite Linux distribution probably and

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:59,190
then there is some smaller set of non

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,830
official meaning like not officially

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,159
endorsed and supported by document

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,529
foundation distributions mostly based on

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:12,259
some unix-like operating system like for

00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:12,259
example FreeBSD or haiku

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,629
so yeah now I would like to move the

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,379
focus to the Linux operating system if

00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:31,629
it was like this it would be there would

00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:36,919
be just one front them to rule them all

00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:43,309
that will be of course perfect but Linux

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:49,009
is all about choice isn't it so on Linux

00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:52,219
you can actually pick up three different

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:55,189
flavors of like how the front end looks

00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:58,069
like and how well is it integrated into

00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:00,349
the desktop the first and the oldest one

00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:04,309
of them is the generic it's 11 front end

00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:09,499
it's pretty ugly it looks like Windows

00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:12,469
95 and its desktop integration sucks a

00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:14,960
big deal then there is an integration

00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:19,339
with gnome desktop environment based on

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,949
gtk I actually thought that this gnome

00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,899
front-end is a bit older than the KDE

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,839
one but I checked it looks this morning

00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:30,379
and they're about the same age so it

00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:35,870
started in 2004 it was started by my

00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:39,499
comics and in 2011 it got Portus to GT

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:43,520
k3 and brought to perfection by kweilyn

00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:47,770
mcnamara and about the same age the KD

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,080
or cute well it was not cute paced yet

00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,110
KDE front end was born in the same

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,139
company it was Suzy and the KDE 3 based

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,899
front end was started by Yann halusky

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:07,129
and five years later it was ported to

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:10,129
KDE 4 but it was actually how do you say

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,949
that so I had this talk once or twice

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:16,759
and whenever I started to talk about

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:19,069
like ad for was not really a KDE 4 but

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:23,899
it was just some wrapper around x11

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:27,169
people got pretty bored so I'm not going

00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:30,060
to talk about it in detail but fast

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,640
forward eight years later

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,140
in 2017 two years ago two things

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,229
happened

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:42,810
million wolf created KD KF plasma file

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,920
picker it was some I will talk about it

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:50,570
a bit later so the front end the user

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:54,720
interface was still GT k3 based but as a

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:57,420
plasma file picker was run over this GT

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:03,270
k3 front and as a separate separate

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:06,450
binary and later in 2017 first cute five

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:10,200
base proof of concept of the entirely

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:16,440
new interface for the LibreOffice was

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:19,650
created by an americorps scheme so as I

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,080
said LibreOffice is a multi-platform

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,870
software so if you want to write

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,910
LibreOffice code does it mean that well

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,220
it exists like do you have to write the

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,770
GT K code and at the same time of

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,980
Windows API code and if you want to

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:40,380
write for if you want it to work on Mac

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:44,130
you have to write quartz code that's the

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:47,820
multi-platform code look like this well

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:53,700
sometimes it does but not too often well

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:57,480
the answer is no and no so we have some

00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:01,290
sort of interfaces so on the on the left

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,470
there is some sort of like core library

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,860
which is like some core functionality do

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,050
something for example open a dialog and

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:15,089
set its size or open a file picker and

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,940
do it in such a way that only text files

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:20,160
will be shown so this is a generic

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,790
functionality and it's some sort of

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,130
contract between the core library and

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,529
the front-end library this will be the

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,430
core will be implemented in some generic

00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:36,089
C++ code and the front and in some some

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:39,209
platform-specific code so to open a

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,780
dialog we create a new cute dialogue and

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:46,320
then we resize it to open a file picker

00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:50,010
we create cute paste file picker and

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,080
then we set its filter and similarly if

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,420
you want to copy text to clipboard we

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,210
can write some generic C++ code doing

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,900
that in the core and then we implement

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:06,510
the same functionality in using the

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:09,450
appropriate API of cute library so this

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,640
is some kind of like once again like

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,100
more or less the same some kind of

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,400
diagram how how it really works I I

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,620
named this this this woman up there cell

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,690
instance because because the class

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:28,800
actual implementing this is called cell

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:31,290
instance and if I'm talking about some

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,070
platform dependent functionality what

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,480
exactly do I mean by that so I divided

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,590
this functionality into the two

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:45,540
categories basic and extended basic

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:48,210
functionality that's yeah well just like

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,660
the basic stuff so create the windows

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:54,180
connect them to the window manager make

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,770
them look like native so make Libre

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,430
Office look like any other KD

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:03,600
application add some native menus to

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:06,720
that add some like make file and photo

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,190
Pickers behave and look like any other

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,730
folder pickers on KDE platform and then

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,160
comes the extended functionality so so

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,540
everything everything else beyond basics

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:26,160
so users want to copy paste text or

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:28,950
images they want to drag file from file

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,810
manager to the to the office application

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,300
they want to just like I'll do right now

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,530
they want to present stuff on the roll

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:41,040
screen and labor office just like for

00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:46,110
example Firefox has comes with some set

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,060
of extensions so those are some some

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,180
extra modules you can install on top

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,070
that come with some extra functionality

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,310
that is not in core and one of the most

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,000
famous LibreOffice extensions is Volvox

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:02,610
which is some sort

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,260
of advance template manager yes and when

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,750
you present you of course want to

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,500
sometimes embed videos and animated gifs

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:16,140
and various media content into your

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:20,340
slides so yeah that looks like quite a

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,890
lot of work right so yeah that was I I

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:27,080
looked approximately like this when I

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,080
realized how much work that's gonna be

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:39,420
we can do it and we did okay how did we

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,650
make this happen

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,800
so the first step the thing I did not

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,740
want to talk about td4 libero face

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,770
integration the windows you saw on the

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,770
screen were not native windows those

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,470
were x11 windows and the events that

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:03,089
were being processed were not native cue

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:05,339
events those were x11 events so if we

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:10,980
wanted to like the transition between

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:15,120
KDE 4 KD 5 if we wanted to port this to

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:18,530
cute 5 it was not possible because cute

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:23,490
library put accessing all the x11

00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:26,670
functionality directly to an end so we

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,670
had to it was obsolete and cute 5 and we

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:32,640
had to write it anew so the very first

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,280
step was to do away with takes 11

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,030
windows and replace those with native

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,070
cue windows or qwidget and what we need

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,540
to do with those windows of course like

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:47,520
they need to be opened and closed

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,770
optionally also like with this kind of

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,170
annoying nagging dialogue if you want to

00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:56,310
close the window oh you have unsaved

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,870
changes don't forget to save them it

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,240
would be also nice to be able to

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,640
maximize and minimize window and set

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,320
their size and also remember their size

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:10,889
to be able to restore it later and over

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,829
the main window we can open we can open

00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:16,319
dialogues which can be modal like for

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:19,799
example printing dialogue which means

00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:21,749
the window underneath is blocked as long

00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,839
as this dialog is open or they can be

00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:27,089
modeless for example spell checkers so

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,459
while I I checked

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:31,529
what's the current spelling gonna be I

00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:36,449
can still interact with the underlying

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:40,859
window but not all windows are created

00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:44,519
equal yes like there are those trivial

00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:47,850
cases the main window the dialogue but

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:58,649
there are also two windows I guess I

00:15:47,850 --> 00:16:04,859
will I hope I will for example this is a

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:07,769
dual window some kind of dockable things

00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:18,600
so I want to be able to to dock it and

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:26,309
undock it and similarly I can I can

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:38,160
undock the toolbar and I want to be able

00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:41,269
to dock it again so the next step since

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,339
we now have two windows are native and

00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:47,970
that means that nice bonus of that is

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:52,019
that they receive cue events so what we

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:55,049
simply do is that we map those cue

00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:58,379
events that come our way to the

00:16:55,049 --> 00:17:02,699
LibreOffice events and process them the

00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:05,159
liberal of his way yes and I'd like

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,860
those PI events I mean like keyboard

00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:10,019
presses and mouse clicks but since not

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,929
all events I use driven we have also

00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:16,289
some additional events dispatcher for

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:19,980
for I know like as you import the file

00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:23,809
the progress bar moves or the extensions

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,809
come with their own set of events

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:32,010
and yes so now we can open the windows

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,350
we can resize them do things with them

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,260
we can process the events and it's time

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,770
to put some content into the windows so

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,080
the way this is done is that as I said

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,960
this is aq main window it has a central

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:50,340
widget and there is one giant central

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,340
widget which is a custom widget and yes

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,830
and then we paint we take Q painter and

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,370
Q style option to style the visits in

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,950
the native way and to create to create

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:06,570
the Q images here for example we have

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:10,110
fun we have a button and then we simply

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:13,290
paste the bitmap onto the custom widget

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:20,130
and like it's like some sort of

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:23,520
patchwork like we we composed the final

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,980
bitmap in the window from from the Q

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,059
images made of like all those individual

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,090
widgets and of course like having night

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:37,980
if Windows comes with some some nice

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:44,790
side effects so for example we can now

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:47,100
support the native menus so and the nice

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,960
bonus of that is with that we have the

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,230
integration with the global menu for

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,220
free the only thing we need to do is to

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,919
map libreoffice menu structure to cute

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,650
menu structure and also the native

00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,830
tooltips are now possible before it was

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:07,110
sort of misery to resize and positions

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,850
the tooltip correctly we don't have to

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,570
do that anymore because the cute will do

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:16,830
it for us now so with some nice

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:19,650
screenshot of the global menu and while

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,960
we are we're at improving look and feel

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,660
before example something that we're

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,340
proud of we improve the look and feel of

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:33,179
this of this notebook bar this looks

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:35,470
like Windows 95 and this is how the

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:42,490
night iftar bar looks like

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:44,020
I will I will simply quickly quickly

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,870
jump through the because I don't have

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,299
that much time left over the file picker

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:52,360
functionality as I said there was some

00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:54,610
initial work done by million wolf that

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,760
was a separate binary that communicated

00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,100
with the core LibreOffice over-over

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,970
standard in and standard out it was a

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,950
bit of a hack but it was pretty easy to

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:11,080
to port it to the new code and yeah

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,059
basically like the same principle some

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,059
like generic codes where the programmer

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,340
says open a file picker and some

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,140
platform-specific code that actually

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,250
opens the file picker and does things

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,220
with it things like there are some

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,720
slight differences between when you open

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,789
the file or whether you want to save

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,159
into the file and then you have to

00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:36,309
retrieve the URL you want to save into

00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,100
or you want to open a switch to folder

00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:41,679
set the filter like what kind of what

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,450
type of files you want to see and also

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,809
it would be nice to have some access to

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:51,580
files on the remote shares and since

00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:53,020
there are some things that come only

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,059
with LibreOffice like for example

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,730
there's another thing I'm personally

00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:00,130
proud of because I worked on that you

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:04,090
can encrypt and sign the file with jpg

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:07,330
key so there's this nice checkbox up

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,390
there where you can upon saving the file

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,840
you can pick check the checkbox and it

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,190
will get encrypted with your GPG key and

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,740
for those with need those custom

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,530
controls those checkboxes or list boxes

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:25,600
and we don't want to be able to get and

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:29,140
set their value okay so once this is

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,710
done we can put our feet up and relax

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,710
right

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:40,059
unfortunately now only when we like when

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:42,880
we got the code into this shape and then

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:45,490
users started to report backs and we

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,460
discovered all those things that users

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,240
do with our office suit

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,770
so for example they copy and paste and

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,420
they drag and drop and they use

00:21:52,770 --> 00:22:00,810
extensions and they create slideshows

00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:03,810
you know it was pretty overwhelming so

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:06,540
yes like I are like I don't have that

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:10,080
much time left like to to go into much

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:14,850
much detail that like we had to we have

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,980
to implement copy and paste this is

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:20,070
again like the same generic scheme like

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,550
this um some interface that generic that

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,350
like gets the content or says set puts

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,110
the stuff into clipboard erase from

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,010
clipboard in a generic way in the core

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,530
and here it is reimplemented

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:36,900
reimplemented in in terms of cute api

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:40,460
and what's also a bit interesting is

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:45,570
this special case special sort of

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,900
selection clipboard on x11 so it's not

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:51,030
like control-c control-v but like

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,240
putting the stuff that's selected that's

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,760
highlighted by mouse up there into the

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,180
clipboard and for that we needed to

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:04,380
implement some sort of lazy handling or

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:06,120
lazy loading which means which means not

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,810
putting the data into clipboard

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,240
immediately but only like put it there

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:16,950
when it's available and when somebody

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,980
else wants to read more or less the same

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,290
with with drag-and-drop like this

00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,630
internal drag-and-drop within one

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:28,380
application but also from outside from

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:31,620
other text editor or from file manager

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:35,430
and this was also quite interesting

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,280
problem with the extensions the

00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,580
extensions do all kinds of things they

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:44,520
open their own dialogues they open

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,050
another window they execute commands and

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,980
they can even add their own user

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:52,410
interface elements and unfortunately

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,710
sometimes the extensions run in a

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,030
different thread and this presents a

00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,269
little bit of a problem because

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,820
everything happened

00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:03,159
happens into user interface and cute has

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,580
to be run into main threaten if it isn't

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:10,119
all kinds of weird things happen like

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:15,009
crashes and that locks so so we somehow

00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:18,959
had to to trim this interface or to get

00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:22,239
it into shape that every single user

00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:29,200
interface access happens in the main

00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:31,869
thread yes and then there was like ten

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:37,349
thousand paper cuts lots of rendering

00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:40,869
glitches but access to system fonts

00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:44,289
users that don't type with latin scripts

00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:47,379
like Chinese Japanese Korean needs

00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:49,059
support for input methods of course it

00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:55,869
would be nice to have to interface

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:57,309
accessible and it is yes and at the end

00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:00,450
of the day there was thought it was the

00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:04,209
slide show I have to admit that impress

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:06,639
was the thing we retested the least

00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:09,309
because what you usually do you put some

00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:10,629
data into spreadsheet or you type some

00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,179
text in the text editor

00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:16,899
and you don't present stuff on the

00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:20,529
screen every day right so we didn't

00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:22,899
really test it this and we didn't really

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:24,729
think about those corner cases so if you

00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:25,209
if you run the slideshow in LibreOffice

00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:27,639
impress

00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:29,619
you have like two windows on two

00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:31,959
different screens sometimes they are the

00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:33,899
same sometimes they aren't because you

00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:36,070
have a special presenter console

00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:40,149
sometimes the slides can have some

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:42,339
multimedia content embedded videos or as

00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:45,009
you have seen those those animated gifs

00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:48,359
so those are handled as embedded cute

00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:52,409
windows and we also had to add some

00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:55,509
elementary support for OpenGL because

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:59,789
sometimes this transitions between the

00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:59,789
slides can be implemented with OpenGL

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,429
so yeah maybe you now think this is

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,970
great can I try where where can I get

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:13,220
this nice stuff it's all in LibreOffice

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,400
master so you can build it yourself of

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,039
course but you don't have to you can if

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,740
you want latest and greatest you can

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,669
download daily builds from LibreOffice

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:29,029
org or you have it shipped with your

00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:31,429
Linux distribution the first version

00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:34,220
that has this is LibreOffice 6-2 which

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,690
is stable bite now it has been released

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,179
in February this year

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,080
and every major news distribution

00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:44,990
adopted it you just have to install an

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,419
extra package which is called KD

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:50,090
integration and of course by

00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:52,640
transitivity LibreOffice 63 has it as

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,450
well has been released earlier this

00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:00,110
month and I have to say by now this

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,990
stuff is relatively bug free so there

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:09,440
are not many open box and it there are

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:14,390
some corner cases and with this I'm at

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:18,140
the very end of my talk so if there are

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:22,330
any questions or comments or offers of

00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:24,050
fear or criticism I'm all ears

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:29,890
offer that beer

00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:32,900
[Applause]

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,070
how's the network excess stuff going to

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,080
work are you working on ki Oh

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:41,480
integration fully free office or house

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:44,360
that yet but it's it's planned like it

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,360
doesn't work with ki Oh we simply enable

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,610
the URL start things with web DAV or SMB

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,150
or like those things there is an

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:55,760
integration with g io but k io that's a

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,980
missing feature okay thinking it's bland

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,780
I think there was some G sub project

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,309
like announce for the next year like

00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:06,950
it's one of the possibilities of

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:09,190
projects to pick more questions way back

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,190
there

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:25,169
so this current equation could that also

00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:28,769
be used on non UNIX platforms like

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:34,700
Windows and Mac yes people try to build

00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:36,960
it on Windows and it it compiles but

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:45,559
certainly it's not in the state it

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:49,130
compiles ship it other questions yes

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:52,200
maybe you didn't even considered it but

00:28:49,130 --> 00:29:00,630
how about the Weiland support doesn't

00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:05,460
work it should but at the moment it

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:08,490
doesn't there is some crash because of

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,889
yes some corner case and it's it's it's

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,210
reported as a back against one of the

00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:16,980
cute violent

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:23,929
I don't know libraries and I predict an

00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:27,570
app image question from over here well

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:31,470
no app image but I was going to ask if

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:34,620
there is any consideration to create a

00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,429
mobile version of LibreOffice and if

00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,019
there is if you are considering using

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:44,730
Kitakami for it

00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:47,490
app image what I don't know what that is

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:51,419
I'm sorry if you are considering making

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,669
a mobile version what version a mobile

00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,690
version a mobile version oh yes there's

00:29:53,669 --> 00:30:01,019
Libre Office for Android and that's some

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:05,850
separate application and there's even

00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:08,370
some integration for the for the iOS but

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:10,860
like I think I'm not involved in this

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,980
but I think like the plan is more like

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,740
if you want Libre Office on mobile this

00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,230
Libre Office online rather go that way

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,360
like somehow force this labor office

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,680
online on to them on my platform because

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,510
it's less work okay

00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,510
my prediction was terrible I guess I

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,870
think to answer the first question that

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,670
came along as far as understand like

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,510
Libre Office now uses the KD file

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:44,490
dialogues

00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:47,040
yes and so such that at that point my

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,690
project I worked on carry a fuse it

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,610
would be converted to a local yes that

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,260
would be that would be like really and

00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:55,650
so that will kind of solve the carrier I

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,990
we had problems with this with writing

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,990
on to web TV because LibreOffice is this

00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:04,080
kind of K unique application is that the

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:06,660
thing that's the correct reward so we

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,970
had trouble with writing on web div and

00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,650
we were looking into ways how to fix

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:15,060
this problem and I was particularly

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:16,890
looking at this K Kai ki o fuse but it

00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,110
was it was like two years ago when it

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:23,370
was in the pretty bad shape it's better

00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:25,280
now sir woohoo we got time for one more

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:30,140
if someone wants to ask a question and

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,140
otherwise I will tell their go to show

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,000
[Laughter]

00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:40,580
if there are no other questions I'd like

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:45,580
to thank Catalina again

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,580
