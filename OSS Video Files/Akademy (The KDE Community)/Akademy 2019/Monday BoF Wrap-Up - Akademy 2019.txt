one of the nitrox people

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,840
maui has mysteriously vanished

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,760
yeah marco's going to do a little bit on

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,000
maui come on up

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,360
but you

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,039
no one else can hear you okay so i

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,719
i arrived not at the beginning so i i

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
don't know all of it

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,880
but yeah there was a bit of a discussion

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,000
on where to

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,159
where to put maui how to to position

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
it

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,669
okay yeah i don't really remember

00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,669
[Music]

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,000
uh yeah but but maui

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,119
the nitrox part was uh was more on their

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,479
plans on plasma mobile if

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,560
they may want to have

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
some slightly different user experience

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
with maybe a

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,280
different home screen uh we have

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,560
infrastructure from for that we also

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,560
discussed if uh

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,439
if there was some some things that can

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
be improved

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,880
in the in the in the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:09,840
collaboration so uh that it feels

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
a bit less of a different thing so

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,040
depending how how things will evolve

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,200
they may they may start to

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,239
work on the one plasma ui

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,000
upstream plasma ui directly or

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
or maybe wanting just some

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
some some little customizations another

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,400
another

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,879
things for maui was since they uh

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,120
they value a lot having the application

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,200
on android

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,720
but they are still not on our android ci

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,680
so exactly

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,200
they they reach to the conclusion that

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
they should

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
they should get to into our android ci

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,159
so

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,400
uh exactly what what they need to to do

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,879
on their part to have them just work

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,000
there so they they will be

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,000
at the android both yeah that's it

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,120
thank you marco

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,519
and in the afternoon they moved on to

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,840
the get

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
lab

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,879
get lab off so i'd like to hand it off

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
to ray thank you

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,080
so i think we had a pretty good session

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
i

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
counted about 35 40 people in the room

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,319
uh talk

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,280
uh briefly about our community product

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,480
uh and alessia who i mean both alyssia

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,799
and jacob had to

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
go back and catch their trains uh i

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,879
think we appreciate a lot of

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
questions especially when alessia was

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,680
going through the workflow of

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
committing code doing reviews relating

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
them to issues

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
i appreciate your questions i mean there

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,480
are i mean couple of pain points that

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,239
you

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
that we go through as well like

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
selecting range

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
a range of lines like when you're

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,480
commenting on something that's something

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
that yeah we're familiar with

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
a good question about federated user

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,159
profile we'll definitely have to check

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
on that but if i miss anything big

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,360
uh let me know and then yeah couple kind

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
of finish it off with

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
his experience contributing to gitlab as

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
a community member and

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
hopefully we'll see some of that as you

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,240
guys continue to kick tires

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
but that's about it

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,160
thank you rayne

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
and rounding off the day in that

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,320
particular room was the higg and

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
kirigami documentation fabian ritmeyer

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
and

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,639
okay so yeah we

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
did a short presentation of the human

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,800
interface guidelines and uh

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,280
talked about problems with using them

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,280
and then we had quite a longer

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,680
discussion about the origami

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
documentation yeah so

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
we we do have right now the api docs of

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,840
kirigami

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,840
which is which is awesome even though

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
the presentation of those dogs will have

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
to

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
improve but this is another set of

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,080
problems

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,320
what we want to also have is

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
a different website which is the

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,400
developer documentation

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,000
uh more high level compared to api docs

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,240
so uh with uh many tutorials

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
and explaining many concepts

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,919
which are more about the interaction of

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,160
the various parts

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
rather than the documentation of one

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,160
class

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,400
and we will try to do that and see if if

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
it can be used as a as an example

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:03,120
for other kd projects or if it's a

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,479
good idea altogether or not we have

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,759
some volunteers to work on some parts

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
of this website

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,199
we will we have a mailing list

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:22,639
that we never really used so we will

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,840
take the main list as

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,479
kind of repurpose it as the central

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
point

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:34,560
to where to coordinate the work on

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:38,080
documentation writing and see how

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,680
this will go and hopefully to make it

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
way more useful for new people

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,829
[Applause]

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,759
thank you higg folks uh moving on to the

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,000
next room we've got in u102 we had promo

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,759
stuff all morning by ivana

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
and paul paul's here

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
okay so we started off by looking at the

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,000
state of

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,520
promo uh where we had advanced and uh

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,520
we found that uh

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
nearly all our figures were up except

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,680
for

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,759
in something like the dot and we were

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
wondering why that was like that so we

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
are thinking of

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,280
maybe giving it a new look and try and

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,000
see what sort of topics

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,599
we can make we can publish there to

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
attract more traffic to that we're

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,280
finding that

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
the headlines of the dot do raise

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,000
interest

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,199
on social media but people are not

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,960
clicking on them to go

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,800
to the site so we

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,639
thought of several strategies we could

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,000
try to to

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,720
increase traffic to the dot

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,720
then we talked about announcements and

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,840
we know that for example the last one

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,120
for apps 19.8 in 1908

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,280
there were some people that were not

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,400
we're not happy with it we had

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,520
uh some reasons to do that and we

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,360
we think that we probably didn't

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
communicate them so we're gonna think

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
we're gonna think of ways of

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,199
uh we're gonna think of ways no we

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
thought of ways of communicating with

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,800
the developers better

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
and so they could submit their we could

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,680
have a two-way

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,039
uh feedback so that we could uh use

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
their input for to make the

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
announcements better and they could use

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,440
our input so that they know

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,000
what sort of information we need to

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,399
ensure that they that they are fairly

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,440
represented in announcements

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,560
then we talked about kdark that the

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
website which is

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,800
we found several problems with the

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
website with the

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,720
landing page of the website and uh we

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
talked about

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
possible redesigns that could be used to

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,880
make it

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,920
more visitor friendly and to do

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,720
some uh to get users

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,880
to actually get to what they're looking

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,920
for when they go to kd.org

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,440
um carl schwann will

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,680
have be having a buff about this

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,600
tomorrow and

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,680
we uh promo uh forded some ideas and

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
uh he's gonna talk with developers

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
tomorrow and

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,279
from those two things we will come up

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,839
with a design that will make that

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
better that's it

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,920
thank you kde promo um moving on to the

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,519

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
framework six and the relation to q6 and

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,839
we discussed a number of topics one of

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
them was

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
um when do we actually branch out kf6

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
and start

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
using q6 it's actually too early for

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,560
that

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
it's going to be you know maybe another

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,839
six months we want to

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,440
use maybe when the first q q 6 alpha is

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,800
out then we can start doing that but

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,680
before that we still have a lot of work

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,040
so we discussed a number of

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,519
things that are that should be

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
investigated or done and actually

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,560
so we have a new board on fabricator

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,519
it's empty right now but

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,720
we will fill it with the it's not empty

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,760
anymore oh it wasn't here for a long

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
time but now it's done

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,200
cool um and then

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
the the work of actually figuring out

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,760
all of the cleanups that have to be done

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,360
that is quite some work in itself and we

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,399
thought maybe we need to do an actual

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,920
sprint for that

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,680
and possibly early december um so that

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,399
because that's basically what we did at

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,959
ronda

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
uh in 11 that was quite some years ago

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,640
for

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,399
um for frameworks five and that

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,920
that has led to a number of very

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,880
interesting results so we would like to

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,720
re

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,760
redo that another time and then

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,040
once once we start branching out um

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,959
six the idea is that um when we start

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
releasing framework six then we will

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,440
still have

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
a kind of a stable branch for frameworks

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,399
five so that we can still do

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
um less frequent but still some releases

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
of frameworks five in parallel

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
maybe every three month or four or

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
whatever there are security issues or

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,279
whatever

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,160
so we managed to avoid branches until

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,160
until now but

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,360
at that point we will actually have to

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
have branches

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
uh yeah and then we'll discuss a number

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,519
of you know specific issues what do we

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
want to get rid of

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,839
how do we make a support library these

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,660
kind of things but that needs more

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,839
investigation

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:51,360
[Applause]

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,240
there was only a single dan involved in

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,240
the next buff

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,279
and it's delegated yeah there was an

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,600
unfortunate k alarm accident for dan so

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,639
that ended up with me

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,760
um yeah we in the uh pimbrov we

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,040
discussed uh various topics that

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,920
are currently relevant in in that area

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,160
the first one is finalizing the move of

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
k

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,519
contacts and k calendar core to

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,440
frameworks that

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,760
should hopefully be executed within the

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
next week so the october release of

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,200
frameworks will have those two

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,720
included um then we discussed

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,120
what to move next to frameworks

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,639
mainly driven by requests from the

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,079
plasma mobile team

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,680
and it looks like the the next one to

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,399
look into is the

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
duff protocol implementation necessary

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,839
for

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,839
kaldorf and kartarf

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,079
then we looked into removing some of the

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,959
pain due to

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,720
external users depending on internal api

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,839
and that seems to be in a large extent

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,279
to due to address book access

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,519
and the way forward there seems to be

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,839
that report those to jpeople

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,040
which is the abstraction for that

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,040
independent of aquinali

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,320
and then we discussed creating something

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
similar

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,240
like k people for calendar

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,040
again driven by by plasma mobile and

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
buchan

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,160
specifically and i just heard that niko

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,560
is already implementing this

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,800
that could for example replace the very

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
attack integration that we have for the

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,760
plasma

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,040
calendar applet and have that on a on a

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,000
cleaner and better way to access actual

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,000
calendaring data

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,360
and yeah in general we discussed on how

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
to get the

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,800
plasma mobile pym team and the

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,079
dinosaur pym team closer together and

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,040
then

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
collaborate better

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,480
we discussed on how to get sunshine into

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,040
the application release

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,720
that is waiting for kevin to finish the

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,000
current release and then we'll hopefully

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,000
be able to integrate that

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,199
[Music]

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,199
oh yeah and finally

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,839
following the kf6 discussion uh one part

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,440
that we need to look into

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,560
is the heavy use of cross in the account

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,560
wizard

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
which led to a discussion on how to

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,399
generally redesign the whole account

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,600
handling in gmail and making more use of

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,720
the work that

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,760
is ongoing that has already been done in

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,120
k accounts and

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,350
how to bring all of that together um

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:49,519
yeah i think that's it

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:52,880
[Applause]

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
thank you dinosaurs

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,320
um moving on to the next room u207 had a

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,279
release

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,360
team meeting i'd like to call on alberts

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,800
to talk about the releases

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
yep so we talked a bit uh about the pain

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,360
points

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
we're having with the kde applications

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,720
releases

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,079
david uh mentioned that he has already

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
fixed some of those

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,160
for the frameworks releases so we're

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,279
gonna steal that from him

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,079
there's also some pain points related to

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,680
how we

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:30,160
update upload applications to flat hub

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,519
alesh has some ideas we might want to

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,600
implement so there's

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,040
work on that nobody from the plasma team

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,399
show up so i don't know if they have

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
problems or not but

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,680
there might be a plasma uh both at some

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,360
point where that will be discussed

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,360
uh yeah and that's basically it we

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
forgot to make to took notes so don't do

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
that

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,480
when you start above start decide that

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,839
who will take notes you will have you

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,279
won't have the problem i'm having right

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
now of not remembering

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,720
what we talked about and that's it thank

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
you

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,759
[Applause]

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,639
or maybe you could delegate that works

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,759
too

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,079
uh moving on to the next room snapcraft

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,079
and

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,079
snaps was run by adults

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,839
and maybe john wants to talk about it

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,839
john is in hiding

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,800
but it was actually run by igor who is i

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,160
guess not here so he's really in hiding

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,040
and he gave an introduction to packaging

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,279
stuff with snaps

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,079
and how they work and how you make your

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,600
programs with them

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,440
and how they install and

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
then sat down with them for a couple of

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,079
hours to go over some problems

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,720
and found many problems and and

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,720
maybe fix them

00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,000
[Applause]

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,079
let's see if i can get harold to show up

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,839
for this one open qa

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
for kde

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,280
kai is not going to talk about it

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,959
um so once again we talked about open qa

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,640
just like last year the result is

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,880
exactly the same as last year we want to

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,000
use it more and we are not quite sure

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,959
how

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
we looked a bit about at what we already

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,919
have

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,880
and it's not good enough so we wanted to

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,000
make two so we want to make it better

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,280
but the road there is a bit unclear what

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,840
we certainly want to

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,320
have is more tests and more

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,000
comprehensive tests but yeah

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,679
there's some foundational things that

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,520
are still not in place to

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,600
actually enable making tests

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,160
or creating tests easily so that's a bit

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,160
of a blocker

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:58,559
[Applause]

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,160
thanks harald mamarock

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,640
well you wrote it you're on the wiki

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
yourself

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
next time delegates writing the wiki

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,280
entry

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,320
on users on user support okay um

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,799
oh yes okay um we did

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:22,240
actually gather people from all kind of

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,559
uh corners of kde who are closely or

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,840
largely related to user support

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,280
be this documentation with these wiki

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,520
videos system

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,720
etc we did a short state of the user

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
support

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,080
being aware that there are channels

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,960
where we get user support questions in

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,360
which are simply not tangible because

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,160
they don't even provide a chronological

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,200
order like facebook or twitter

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,840
who tend to mix up everything there is a

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
similar problem on reddit where user can

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,679
just

00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,520
vote up or down valuable into

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,480
interesting stuff and replace it with

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,799
junk

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,919
so those are not platforms really

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,799
suitable for

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
we have the forum we have irc we have

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,320
the mailing lists

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,799
all of those have their advantages but

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,200
of course also their downsides

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:22,840
and ideally we would want to have

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,320
a better suited

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,120
medium that can

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,799
eventually replace the forums the

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,720
problem is for example for all the

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,760
multimedia applications who are the

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,840
biggest applications

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,559
in kde like create arcadian live

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,600
who use the forum as a user support very

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,840
extensively

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,280
but are limited by its capabilities of

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,280
using

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,919
images and media files so

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,760
the other thing is that if we are

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,799
working on new

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,440
channels of user support sysadmin must

00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,360
be

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,600
on board because they will have to

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,200
implement it and we don't want to

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,200
overload their work um jonathan came

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,360
up with the suggestion to use this

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,320
course which looks very promising

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,960
especially when it comes to using

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
screenshots

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,840
we will have

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,679
to talk to this course people because

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,200
there are some features we would need

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,360
like for example

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,400
the categorization of entries

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,520
else we will end up with endless lists

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,880
of of

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,880
applications and if you can't class them

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,600
in categories as we do currently in the

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
forums

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,120
this will be not really easy access for

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
users

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,480
ben also mentioned that currently this

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
course

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,000
needs docker and

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,760
this might eventually not be the best

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
solution but this might eventually also

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,280
something

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,559
for this admin both on wednesday to talk

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,240
about

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,360
i'm not my speciality

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,720
we want to avoid that people go

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,919
ask questions in mailing lists which are

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,960
not meant for

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,600
we get regular german questions asking

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,360
in

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,640
kde docs n which is meant for

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,559
english documentation writing no

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,440
idea how they come up with that mailing

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,840
list we get

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,400
user support questions on the wiki

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,080
i mean if we miss these questions it's

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,520
not really a surprise because

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,120
nobody looks at that the discussion

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
feature in the wiki is not meant for

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,120
user support

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,880
so ideally we would like to have a

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,919
better suited

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
user support for the users easier to

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,360
find

00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,240
that there is also a necessity from the

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
projects to really take care of user

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,840
support

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,760
we want to make it easier for them the

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
problem currently we have on the forum

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,880
is

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,760
when you don't immediately answer a

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,159
question

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,799
you will not get the updates because

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,600
somehow this doesn't work

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,880
and you get updates but only there has

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
been a question

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,120
but no mention of the content of it or

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,200
the content of the discussion

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,600
which is not necessarily something you

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,200
want to look at when you are

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,919
developing but we came to the conclusion

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,559
that

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,480
we need to make it better but we need to

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,520
also have all the projects

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
contributing because a project which has

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,720
users

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
need to take them seriously because the

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,760
day you don't

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,480
we stop taking care of users

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,039
we will lose them and the project with

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,640
no users can close shop

00:22:53,039 --> 00:23:00,880
thank you

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,799
[Applause]

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,400
a project with no users can close up

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
shop but it's a good thing that we have

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
goals

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,880
to guide our future and lydia is going

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
to

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,679
talk about the offshoot yes we talked

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
about the goals

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,280
um and we did three things the first

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,080
thing was looking

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,240
back at the previous goals and what we

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,559
learned from them what

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,480
we can improve for example one thing

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,440
that we can improve is making it clearer

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
what

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,919
kind of tasks can be picked up for each

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,640
of the goals

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,440
and then in the second part we looked at

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,760
new goals and what

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,000
kind of immediate next steps can be done

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,760
there uh one of the things we identified

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,960
is a landing page that

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,559
leads people to the places where

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
more information about each of them can

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,640
be found as well as

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,960
for the previous goals and the third

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,600
thing we talked about is that

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,120
with the new one new goals being voted

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,799
in that does not mean that the work on

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,640
the old goals stops

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,039
but quite the opposite they're still

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,240
very much

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:12,000
at the center of what we do right they

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:16,840
just integrated in everything we do now

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,840
and we can shift focus a bit yeah thank

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
you

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,320
and rounding out the day in u208

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,039
a was a rather sleepy buff on neon

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,760
for everyone john do you want to talk

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,240
about neon

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
anymore

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,279
we there were not fireworks there was

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,000
just some sleepy people discussing some

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,440
issues with this

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,279
neon most of which can be resolved by

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,559
updating to a new version of qt which is

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,840
handy because there's a new version of

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,120
q-type that we want to

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,240
update to and

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
installing packages that for sort of

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,600
external

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,400
various proprietary things that you have

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,520
problems with

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,600
and looking at that um

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
and while this will work around the user

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,520
experience is not necessarily great

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,840
and it's worth worth us working on how

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,840
to make that great

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,720
[Applause]

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,320
and for everyone who was awake during

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,080
lunch hour there was the kdegm

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,600
that's a traditional thing on the monday

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,520
and frederick is going to tell us

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,240
all about it yeah so some participated i

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
don't want to

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,760
talk much about it we actually

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,679
saw that business in the last year was

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,360
conducted in a good fashion so the board

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
was relieved which is awesome

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
and we had election of two new board

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,480
members

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,320
uh where are you guys near fritos and

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,320
eight congratulations

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,840
thank you very much um that wraps up the

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,960
first day of

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,559
is does anyone feel slighted or missed

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,600
did anyone do anything interesting they

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:15,919
