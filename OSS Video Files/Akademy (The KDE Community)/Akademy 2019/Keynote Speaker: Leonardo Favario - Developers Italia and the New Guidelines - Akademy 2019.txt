Title: Keynote Speaker: Leonardo Favario - Developers Italia and the New Guidelines - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	There are plenty of metrics that are available to measure the health of open source communities. When assessing your contribution to the community, it's important to go beyond quantifiable metrics and also look at areas such as building a sense of community, addressing members' (often intrinsic) motivation, fostering a diverse community, etc.

In this session, there will be a discussion on both quantifiable and non-quantifiable contributions to open source community health. There will also be a discussion on revisiting community goals as the community evolves over time.

and he will speak to us about developers

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,960
italia

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
and the work that they have been doing

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,040
to bring more open source

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,879
at the government thank you leonardo

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,760
thank you

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
can you hear me well yes no maybe yeah

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
cool

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
all right welcome everyone um

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,840
in the last couple days i was thinking

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
about how to communicate

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,359
in this short amount of time whatever we

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,399
have been doing in the past

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
let's say three years and um i wanted to

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
focus

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,280
mainly on these three points let's say

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,479
three topics community legal framework

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,920
and catalog now i know that we

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,680
um we're developers so we don't speak

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,640
legalese so we don't want

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
i don't want to bore you with too much

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
about the

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,240
central legal framework so i will be

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
very very quick about that but

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
i'd like to talk to you about that since

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
i think that italy

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,320
is quite advanced in this sense first

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
and foremost

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,960
who are we and what are we doing um

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,280
i like and we like to define us as

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,840
a startup in the government okay so we

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
are a bunch of folks like 30 to 35

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
people

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,040
um let's say focus on we have a

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
background in different

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
fields from software architecture

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
software development

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
to free and open source software and and

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
we

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
say that we are building the operating

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,399
system

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
of the country what does it mean um

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
government the governments in general

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,120
are complex machines

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
but in order to digitally transform a

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
country

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,640
uh we need to have some

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,480
solid foundations so we need to have the

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,840
digital infrastructure in place

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,319
before thinking about how to uh build

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
layers on top so this is exactly what

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,280
we're focusing on

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,160
um we call them the enabling platforms

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
and uh for example those are like the

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,640
national resident

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
uh register they are like the um digital

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,319
identity

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,959
they are the digital payments and of

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,080
course

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,440
um when we started to think about how to

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,720
implement these ideas and put them

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,400
in actions um we said all right we don't

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,959
just need technology we need to

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,519
involve the citizens as much as possible

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,680
and that's exactly why we built

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
communities around them we have a

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
community called designers italia which

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560
is focusing on

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,239
um writing and developing guidelines

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
for templates for all the public

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
services we have developers italian

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,760
that's the

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
focus of my talk which is focusing on

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,080
how to

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,959
um get people involved so how to get

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,519
developers involved how to get citizens

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,879
involved give feedback and open issues

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
and so on and how to

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,480
of course get public administrators

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,920
first of all understand

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,000
what we're doing and then contribute so

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,239
let's start with the first topic which

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,480
is which i like to call community

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,599
oh developers italia is the community of

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
public service developers and i like to

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,280
say that

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
we're like 3 000 developers even if we

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,920
are not exactly

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,439
all developers we like to treat

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,920
everyone in the same way so um

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,280
what's the particular point i would say

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
the one of the most

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
fundamental one is that everything that

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,519
the italian digital team

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
and everything we are pushing the public

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,599
administration

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,400
to develop is 100 free and open source

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,680
and we'll see how the legal framework is

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
helping us

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,960
in in order to accomplish um this

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,919
uh this target let's say so uh

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
i know and we all know that numbers are

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,800
not a real

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,919
indicator of how communities are

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,000
exactly performing and now and we heard

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,600
really good speeches uh yesterday

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,960
however just to give you a

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,040
quick look-see of the situation we have

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,080
250 open source repositories um

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,360
nearly 3 000 users in in our

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,759
chat channels uh we and they exchanged

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
like 35 000 messages last month

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
it was vacation month so in italy so you

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
may think that

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
uh this is not a huge peak however

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,560
something is happening

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,039
it's uh in an interaction among these

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,000
players is happening on our channels

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,280
and um i like also to focus on uh the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,400
hackathon that in

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,680
october 2017 was run uh

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,600
by our team um and

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
i think uh that this was a way to

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
get people to know what we were doing

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,560
okay so

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,919
uh putting 800 developers in 26 cities

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
also san francisco was

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
connected live uh on the same weekend in

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,919
order to

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,280
develop and work and understand how

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,639
public services

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,639
had had to be

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
you know designed and developed and and

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,039
tested

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,160
was a great opportunity for us to

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
understand

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,919
what people wanted what citizen wanted

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
what public administration

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,800
administrators wanted

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
involve also a little small to medium

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
enterprises

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
and then you know grow the overall

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,199
community

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
so you may say okay you're talking about

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,440
communities uh but

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,639
what are you providing those uh folks

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
what what is

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
uh the objective of your community and

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
and what are you talking about

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
okay so developers italia and you can

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,479
browse the developers.italia.it

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,039
is what we call a developer portal so we

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,880
were focusing mainly on on two

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:30,639
things the first one is uh a platforms

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,319
uh catalog let's say so uh

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,180
i was mentioning before the um

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
the work of the team uh that is um

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,479
[Music]

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,479
working on the enabling platforms so as

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
i told before digital identity digital

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,639
payments and so on

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
but we said okay we are developers so we

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,039
kind of know what we need

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
okay so we don't just need uh some sort

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
of blog posts

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,199
and uh you know rough documentation

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,800
we need something more we need technical

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,080
rules we need

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
uh to have access to a whole set of sdks

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
written in different languages for

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,240
different frameworks we need also maybe

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,160
graphic resources okay so that if we

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,280
need to implement

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,319
a web application using um

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,759
some sort of uh interfaces has to be

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,800
a template uh sort of standard in order

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
to

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
let the citizen have the best experience

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
possible

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,680
and also we need to test okay so

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
as you can see i quickly showed you uh

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,639
what

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,440
um the digital uh identity page on our

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
web portal as so it all it has all these

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,520
sort of

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,240
objects and it uh allows

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
uh developers to quickly access it this

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
is the first part and then the second

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,520
part

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,800
in our developer portal we are

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,080
stressing is the api's selection so

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,240
of course um if we want to interact with

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
public services with some sort of

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
web application somewhere we need to

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
have apis in order

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
also first of all to test and then to

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
understand if

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
uh the code we're writing is actually uh

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,879
performing

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,000
uh the the operation we want so

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,080
how do we find apis in italy is

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,080
in italy sorry it's not so

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,800
straightforward so we said okay let's

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
prepare a web page where we show a

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,879
selection of

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,639
all the rest apis and then we help

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,839
public administrators to write open api

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,680
three specs and and we help them write

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
documentation in order to have again a

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,440
standardized way to interact

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,920
with them okay so what are we providing

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,080
to all the community we have um

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,720
[Music]

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,519
a github account where we are storing as

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
you can see

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,959
uh most of our of our code or where

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,080
people can actually

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,120
become maintainers since we want to

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
involve the community

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
so if someone is doing a great job it's

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
some private citizen it's some

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,279
freelancer

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,200
also if a small medium internet

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,920
enterprise is doing a great job

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,880
uh on a piece of software then it's okay

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,160
they can become

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,440
a maintainer and we are stressing this

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,240
we want to involve

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
as much as possible people to get

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,160
connected

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,279
uh to the code all right code without

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,640
documentation

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,800
is quite um hard to

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
grasp it's quite it's not so

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,720
straightforward to understand

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,000
so um one of the first things that the

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,680
team decided to do was to implement a

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,959
documentation platform

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,839
so this is doc italia and is our

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,839
response to that

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,120
is based on read the docs with a

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,160
template um

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,120
made in a standard in a standardized way

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,800
using the uh designers guidelines and

00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
then at some point we said okay this is

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,640
cool

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,399
but let's let me think about it um we're

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
just storing documentation why don't we

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
just

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,560
try to experiment something new and put

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
also loads

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,320
on top of this platform if you think

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,000
about it a low it's something or

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,320
you know a technical document

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
derived from a low it's nothing else

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,120
than a document that evolves over time

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,680
so we're using to use git every day to

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,480
use

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,360
version control to get div on some piece

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
of code

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
why don't we just try to do it on on the

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
lows as well okay on our legislation so

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
we started

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,480
uh drafting and putting as much

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,279
information as we could on top of this

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
platform and

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,519
right now citizens can easily just

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
browse uh the load they're looking for

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
and

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,959
see the different versions see who made

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,279
a modification where and

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,640
how it did change and so on and on and

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,000
we're using this platform

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,240
stressing its use also for um

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,240
when when a low is getting it's in the

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
process of getting published so we want

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,240
to

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,640
um involve citizens into this decision

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,720
so

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,079
people can comment on this platform they

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,200
can

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,839
you know open merge or pull requests

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,760
they can do all sort of things that we

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,920
are used to do in software development

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,560
but uh maybe and it can be

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
uh of course applicable also in in the

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,800
field of

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,160
a a simple text as always

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,399
but it has never been done before um

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,200
of course other tools that we're

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
providing

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
to our community are um meeting points

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
so an

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
async away is using a forum this is

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
based on discourse

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,720
and um it's incredible how

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,560
people are actually appreciating it

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
private citizens are appreciating this

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
uh platform

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
and they are not only discussing about

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,519
our

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,480
uh platforms our software the ones that

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,120
we are doing

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
at developers italia at the digital

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
transformation team

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,079
but they're talking about every kind of

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,880
service that is available to private

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,160
citizens

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,320
and this is something again maybe it's

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,200
quite trivial for us because we are all

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,800
used to

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,519
um bulletins and forums and chats

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,160
but it's something that is quite uh

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
let's say

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,320
uh revolutionary in a government and

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,279
people are using it as well and then of

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
course we are

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,360
we have a slack channel but we are also

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,639
evaluating other possibilities

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,519
um for letting people uh

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,399
communicate in real time and in a chat

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,959
fashion

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,519
okay so this is uh the the background

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,800
let's say

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,839
uh what developer italia was up until

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,440
a few months ago and but then something

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,079
started to change something started to

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,480
improve and then i want to ease

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
again without boring you too much uh

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
introduce you

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,639
to the new legislation framework uh

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,839
in the in italy so okay um

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,800
italy has um an interesting

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,120
uh set of laws for what regards uh

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,000
digital administration and they are all

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,680
um grouped inside what is called the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
digital administration code

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
and that's that's italian low and it's

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
interesting because

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,000
two articles in this um code

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,120
article 68 and 69 are um

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,120
totally in uh direction

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,680
of free and open source software why

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,800
well because those two articles say they

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,200
a public administration in order to uh

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
in the face in acquisition phase when

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,680
they need to acquire

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
a new software they have to go

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,959
uh free and open source by default okay

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,880
so the first pick

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,800
has to be free and open source and just

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,680
if they cannot find

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,360
um a free and open source solution

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,279
developed by other public administration

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,000
or developed by third parties like

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,959
we could be private citizens then they

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,720
can

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,320
you know we will see how they can

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,040
sign an analysis where they state

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,720
that there was nothing provided and then

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,839
they can start developing

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,639
their own uh code if they develop

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,720
their own code from scratch then okay

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
that code has to be 100 free and open

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
source

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,199
okay so it has to um have

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
an uh free and open source license has

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,120
to be

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,079
uh published on some sort of uh code

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,839
version

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,639
version system and um it has to be

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,360
available for the whole um other

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,480
citizens

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,600
so this law was um already had already

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,160
been crafted when

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,199
the digital transformation team came to

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,760
be however

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,959
uh it was hard to interpret it so it was

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,959
hard to really

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:52,320
understand how of those passages were

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,399
had to be done so a normal

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,600
public administration didn't know

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
exactly how to

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
publish a piece of code how to uh

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,800
interact with other administration in

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,240
order to get

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,399
a piece of code and and get it to work

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,720
so that's why the team in the past three

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,120
years worked on these new guidelines

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
and the name guidelines looks like yet

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,839
another piece of document however right

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,079
now they are low

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
so they are mandatory by low and these

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,399
guidelines i believe are

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,240
a really good opportunity for a public

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,199
administrator to understand

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,639
how this process works so these are

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,680
practical guidelines

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,320
and that um tell everything from how to

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,680
start

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,639
an a project in a open fashion

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,680
by default how to manage uh how to

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,279
maintain

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,079
um a repository how to um

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,720
you know deal with uh merge or pull

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,160
requests

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,720
uh to upstream from other um

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,000
contributors and so on and on and the

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
cool stuff i believe

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
it's that and those these guidelines

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,279
contains

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,279
um some technical attachments

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,040
we call it that way that you can

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,240
basically copy and paste them

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,720
inside a contract you're making

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,399
uh to a third-party developer so that

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,000
even if the developer doesn't know how

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,680
to do that well it's the public

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,399
administration that in the contract

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
itself

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,399
it's specifying what the developer has

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,199
to do in order to go

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,639
open by default okay so um this is

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,480
something um

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
i believe quite revolutionary because

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,040
it's again

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,959
it's basically a mandatory

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,519
by law that um the public administration

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,199
has to go open by this by default so

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,720
again as i told you before

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,759
um this guideline tell a pa to

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
um make a comparative assessment if you

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,680
don't

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,360
find a uh free and open source software

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,600
in our catalog and we'll see what the

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,279
catalog is then you have to

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,639
sign a piece of paper where you say okay

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,480
this software doesn't exist

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
i have to develop it but then when

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
developing it i have to go open by

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,480
default

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,520
um yes that's it but

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,439
just to clarify two quick example

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,039
development phase and let's say reuse

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,799
phase let's call it that way

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,679
so um let's start in this

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,679
little um

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,799
blue ellipse over here so we have public

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
administration a

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,039
that uh for some reason had made the uh

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
comparative assessment and decides that

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,240
uh there's no

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
uh free and open source software

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,760
available

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
and it has to develop a new one so what

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,960
i what it means

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,640
uh okay paa starting from here

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,200
um draft a contract and commissions

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,080
the development to the developer in this

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,679
uh contract

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,400
it's written again

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,760
taken from some of the attachment of the

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,360
guidelines and put it in the contract

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,520
it's written that

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
that piece of software whenever it's

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,200
done

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
the ownership of that piece of software

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,799
and has to be

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,679
assigned to the pa okay so the pa

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,080
um commissions the development software

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
uh

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
that software whenever it's finished the

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
the ownership of that software

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,280
goes back to the pa and then at that

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,160
point the pa

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880
can do basically two things one is

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,080
publish

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,480
that code by itself or

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
the second one is ask the developer to

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,320
publish it

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,160
usually what happens is that you put it

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,280
in the contract that one of the

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,559
uh last thing to do is to ensure

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,679
that that code is being

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,880
uh published on top of some public code

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,480
hosting platform

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,679
okay and then what happens well um

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,039
automatically and we'll see how uh this

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,000
uh code is being indexed into

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,720
our uh developer studio catalog so that

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
our

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,400
other public administration can directly

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,440
draw from it

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,919
okay and see um and

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
make use of it take advantage of it okay

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,520
so that was the development phase

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
let's see the reuse phase again we'll

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,600
start from public administration b

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,559
this time okay down here so public

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,240
administration

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,760
b first thing is that

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,559
the public administration has to do is

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,480
to search for that software

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,480
search for any kind of software on top

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,080
of the our platform on top of

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,720
our catalog if there's a hit let's say

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
what happens okay public administration

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160
b

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,520
tests it uh the power administration has

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
to see if that software is really

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
fitting

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,919
the requirements and their needs

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,679
probably and this is happening

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,840
many times what happens is that probably

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
the administration b needs some

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,720
customization

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,720
needs to have some modification and so

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,720
on so again public administration b

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,120
appoints a developer to do those on

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,720
those customization the ownership of

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,000
those customization goes back to the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
public administration

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
and then again as we saw before that

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
code develop

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,760
goes grows directly on top of a code

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,880
hosting platform

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,240
israel indexed by our catalog

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,919
is shown again so that the an imaginary

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,880
public administration c

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,760
could see the first imago software and

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,840
then also

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:28,080
the modifications okay so that um it's a

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,720
more um immediate and transparent way of

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,760
handling

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,240
uh public administration code okay so

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,120
we saw community the community part we

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,799
saw this

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,440
short let's say resume of the

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,000
legal framework and now we see where

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
this

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
information is actually stored where it

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,760
is indexed

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
and i mentioned before the catalog the

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,679
developers italia platform

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,720
uh what is the catalog what are we

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,520
talking about when

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,080
when we're dealing with the catalog so

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,039
um

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,320
i told before developers italia was a

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,600
developer portal

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,240
it had platforms it had apis

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,760
right now starting in june we also have

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
another section and if you browse the

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,120
side

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
the the site which is also translated in

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,480
english you can

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
easily see it and this new section is

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,159
called

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,600
um software okay it's called software

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,240
catalog

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
so again one of the questions i was

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
asked

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
like i don't know tons and like

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,799
thousands of times

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,679
when i was trying to um talk with public

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,640
administrators

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,400
like pa managers like people who uh you

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,320
know managers who take decisions and

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,240
who uh actually decide if um

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,440
a software has to be developed from

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,559
scratch or

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
as to uh you know reused in some way one

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
of the

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,159
first questions they made me they made

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,919
me was

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,360
where do i find those information where

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,159
do i find that

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,039
piece of software any again thinking in

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
a

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,240
developer fashion it's kind of trivial

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,720
so because

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,799
what what do we do we just browse some

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,240
sort of

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,159
website we query some search engine

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
we ask some friends we just ask the

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,039
community and in a way around there

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,559
we are able to more or less understand

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,159
which are

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,159
the softwares that may fit our needs

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,360
or which are a set of libraries that we

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,360
could use okay

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,559
but this is not so straightforward for

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
example when dealing with public

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,760
administration

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,640
so we decided that we had to build a

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,679
catalog

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,480
and and actually this catalog is uh

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,520
mandated mandatory by low right now and

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,240
the laws i was

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,600
was telling you before and what this

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,039
catalog is is basically

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,039
again a container of all these uh

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,799
information regarding software so you

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,960
can see over here it's

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:58,159
quite light but um every

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,440
every software uh has a

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,799
dedicated page you can um see the

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,559
information on the page information

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,400
regarding i don't know features or

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,120
the roadmap or of course screenshots of

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,760
or you can also see the tree of forks

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
okay

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,080
so that you can understand uh which is

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,520
the original fork that originated the

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,360
other ones or if there's

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,640
a fork that has been maintained more

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
than another one

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
you can see who are the maintainers okay

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,440
which is quite

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,960
quite important and if there is a

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,960
contract right now so

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,559
for example again think about the

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,520
example before so if public

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,000
administration a

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,440
was is right now paying a contractor in

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,520
order to maintain that software

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,880
then public administration b can take

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,400
advantage of that and doesn't have to

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
pay another time to maintain the same

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,760
piece of software

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,880
or maybe they can you know join forces

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,880
and

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
let make that software become a little

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,960
bit more

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,840
featureful or you know better maintained

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,919
and tested

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,960
and then there and then there we also

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,559
inserted

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,919
uh a sort of index we call it

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,240
uh vitality index which

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,799
is a combination there's an algorithm uh

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
that is basically

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
uh taken into consideration all the

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
activity all the activities that are

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,799
going on onto

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,200
a certain repository and it's showing

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,279
some

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,679
sort of vitality in order to help the

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,720
administrators of course the catalog

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,720
has is indexed

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
we have a recommendation system in order

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,600
to you know uh

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:33,360
help in the in the searching phase

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,120
we have um a cloud of tags and so on and

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,520
you can see over here that

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,760
um in the first i would say

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
month and a month and a half let's say

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,400
60 days

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,000
two months uh we already collected like

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,720
40 through 45 solutions so and this has

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,760
been

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,120
um even without us even without the

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,919
digital team going there and asking for

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,559
contributions the public administrations

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,880
just

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,159
reading the guidelines reading the laws

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,559
understood that this is

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,440
mandatory so right now from now on they

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,440
have to go

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
open by default so what they did they

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,200
created if they didn't have one

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,720
a um an organization on top of a

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,640
code hosting platform and they um

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,760
inserted all the information on top of

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,880
that in order to

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,760
be registered on our catalog and be

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,960
indexed

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,000
you may ask okay but how do you get all

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,240
this data

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,440
how do you get information regarding um

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,760
i don't know where the okay where the uh

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,799
who is maintaining the software which

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,640
platforms

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,720
is the software made for um who is using

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
the software okay which are the public

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,960
administration using the software

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
so that's how we crafted and why we

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,919
crafted

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,559
a specification let's say a metadata

00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,799
specification called public code the yml

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,120
and in which is sort of

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,120
you may say okay there are a lot of

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,480
specification standards over there

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,960
however there's not a real one for

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,000
what concerns public administration so

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,559
this standard is

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
exactly uh targeting public

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,760
administration software use

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,559
and um we have been crafting it in a way

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,600
so that

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,919
uh both developers and

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,480
managers so you know decision makers

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,120
can actually take advantage of this code

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,840
of course

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,039
it's yaml so it's easy to write easy to

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,080
read however

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,320
in order to further help our

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,760
administration we we created an editor

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,200
which is basically

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,559
you know um which is what you get

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,240
basically uh forms that you you can

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,000
um you can feel and then what what is

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
the output of this editor you're

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,120
creating that public code the yml file

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,799
you're downloading it

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,880
and the only thing you have to do in

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,080
order to be indexed in our catalog

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,200
is to put that public code the yml file

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,960
in the root of your repository okay so

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,600
this is actually the actions that the um

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,559
public administration did they created a

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,640
public code

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,600
they crafted one exactly with the

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,960
specification

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,679
of their software they downloaded it

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,440
they put it in on the on the route in

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,080
the root of the repository

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,039
that they owned and that every night

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
automatically

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,159
our um crawler crawls

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:40,000
uh all the the public

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,279
code all sting or the on-premises that

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,840
you're

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,279
you're installing for yourself on your

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,399
own organization

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,200
and automatically extract information

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,240
from uh this public or yml file and

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,799
populates

00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:00,399
your uh web page and indexes that page

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,000
into all the uh our catalog so you know

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,520
it's it's really straightforward it's

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,679
really trivial

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,600
okay i've been talking just about public

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,880
administration maybe a little bit boring

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,360
however i'd like to again i think this

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,279
is a

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,120
clear call to action right now since um

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,960
public administrations right now with

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,799
this new legislation are doing

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,440
anything um anything let's say

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,399
fantastic or extraordinary they're just

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,159
you know

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,600
following whatever we are used to do

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,159
when developing free and open source

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,840
software

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,080
just opening a ripple uh using um

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,600
free open source license and then you

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,679
know continuing the development

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,520
the development in the open so that's

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,679
why in the catalog

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,640
apart from the public administration

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,520
reuse part

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,880
there's also another part that we call

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,600
third party

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,640
open source software and in that part

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,039
it's basically

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,640
um that part is basically open to anyone

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,640
so any one of you

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,480
are developing a free and open source

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,039
software uh or

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,399
you know if you find also a piece of

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,760
software that may

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,600
be of interest of a public

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,200
administration well you can create a

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,720
public code oml file

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,000
put it in that ripple with some easy

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,799
pull and merge request and that's how

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,240
immediately uh the night after the the

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,720
crawler will crawl that

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,440
information and will publish that

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,159
software

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,200
on top of the catalog so we see how if

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,399
we

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,600
make this uh catalog alive

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,640
we make it as active as possible we

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,320
publish as many information as possible

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
and so this means as many software as

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,120
possible this means that

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,960
public administrations when they have

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,720
to acquire new software the first thing

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,960
and this is mandatory by law that they

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,360
have to do is to go on that catalog

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,159
to check if that software is already

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,320
there and the loan mandates that if that

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
information that software is there then

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,520
they have to pick it

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,840
okay so i believe this is uh what i call

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,120
a promotion okay so use the catalog as a

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,600
showcase for your software

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,159
in order to let public administration

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,080
know

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,200
that your software is there your

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
software is awesome

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,880
and your software is actually able to

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,600
solve their problems

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,240
and if it's not well they can take it

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,240
and

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,600
maybe you know get in contact with you

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,799
and get a contract

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,440
with you in order to further develop it

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,840
and

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,320
reach the status that they want it to be

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,919
so okay of course this is just a little

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,600
step you may say

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,919
where is this revolution right so um

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,720
this is just a little step but i believe

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,960
it's a

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,640
just i don't know a giant leap forward

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,159
for public administrations

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,720
because um it's

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,919
it has been hard for them and for

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,840
governments to

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,279
find exactly the software that we're

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,279
looking for and

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,799
that has been sort of a scamitage in

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,200
order to develop

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,159
software from scratch or you know get

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,120
some software

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,840
maybe proprietary software with um

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,279
incredible

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,399
uh licenses just because they were not

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,880
able to find one

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,440
so the legislation is on our side right

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,960
now

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,799
we have the catalog we have the

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,200
instruments and the tools

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,640
in order to make the catalog alive and

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,159
to populate it

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,679
and um it this is a way so so that

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,799
we have to um let public administration

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,840
understand that

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,840
this has has to be the default is it's

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,000
right now mandated by low but it will

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
eventually become the default of course

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
this is a little step

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,120
we don't want just them to publish the

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,399
software when it's released

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,919
we are in this outreach phase the

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,120
digital transformation team

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,399
is telling everyone how to handle

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,279
software and be

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,320
a software development and be open by

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,760
design okay

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,880
so from the very first step you have to

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,120
go open involve the community listen to

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,320
the feedback of your citizens which are

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,799
actually the users

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,240
of your software and in this way make it

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,230
as much interoperable

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:21,679
as possible thank you

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:29,679
[Applause]

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:32,240
any questions

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,039
hey thanks for the presentations i and i

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,760
have two small

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,840
tools questions number one one is that

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
are there any security audit conducted

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,640
by

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,720
by independent parties on the open

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,480
source code and number two is that

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,760
are there any kind of bug bounty

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,360
programs for the

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,799
imported for the open source course

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,880
all right should we pick other questions

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,559
or yeah maybe i can

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,399
yeah thank you for your question very

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,440
interesting one um yes

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,320
so i would say right now the code is out

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,799
there

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,679
um so what we're telling it public

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,320
administrations

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,039
is like hey watch out you don't have to

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,320
just

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,039
download that repo clone the ripple and

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,480
just docker

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,039
compose up okay um you in the first

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,840
phase

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,279
what you need to do is to uh probably

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,399
appoint or contract

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,919
a developer

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:29,039
or a as you said some auditors

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,760
uh that will carry on and

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,360
you know do some auditing process on top

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,799
of that piece of software

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,120
so that um you have to understand it

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,080
also from a security perspective

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,279
uh someone reviewed that code you know

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,799
someone actually

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:49,919
uh tested that code someone did some

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,720
sas or you know some sort of analysis on

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,720
that code

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,760
so that's exactly what we're telling the

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,880
public instruction

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,480
it's not exactly self-service okay so

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,399
okay the code is there but it's also

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,559
your auxiliaries are there okay so

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,159
uh but however when we talk to paul

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,440
administration we say okay

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,599
that's there but please run a

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,599
um a security analysis on top of that

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,919
however what we are implementing right

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,480
now is exactly in this direction

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,520
so we would like to give public

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,159
administrations

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,119
that want to pick or in the acquisition

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,480
phase let's say

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,879
uh an indication so running uh from our

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,440
side

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,359
on the digital transformation team uh

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,119
some security analysis

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,919
um i don't know also container uh

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
testing and so on um we want to give

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,040
them

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,800
an overview of what's the state of the

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,119
uh the security of that

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,839
of that software regarding bug bounty

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,320
programs

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,159
um okay we are aware of like the

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,520
european union one like the fossa

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,679
project and um it's

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
we are in the process of defining how to

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,760
do this it's

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,320
exactly what we would like to do uh i

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,960
think it's

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,599
uh personally i think it's a it's a good

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,760
approach

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,160
however we need to define how to how to

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,480
go this direction

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,520
um i have a question thank you very much

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,599
for your presentation

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,440
i've noticed that you have documentation

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,720
both in english and

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,720
in italian so the first question is what

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
is your working language

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,760
and second question is who writes your

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,800
documentation

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,560
okay cool thank you um yes

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,599
good question so we try to go english by

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,960
default

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,560
uh in since

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,160
for a lot of many different reasons i

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,480
mean also because when

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,079
when you know dealing with developers we

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,680
all kind of know english

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:49,200
and so that is not a real

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,880
you know obstacle however um

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,800
since we're italian government we have

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
to of course provide also italian

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,160
documentation

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,200
so we try to have both for most of the

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,760
projects

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
um regarding who writes the

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,720
documentation

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,400
we have a team of tech writers um

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,880
with which is uh quite active and they

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,200
have

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,040
a lot of interaction with the developers

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,800
so yes where we can

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,560
we use tech writers in order to write

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,200
documentation especially for what

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,760
i told you are the enabling platforms

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,960
where

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,599
you know good documentation really is

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,880
needed

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,599
so we try to uh make use of their

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,040
knowledge

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,280
in writing documentation as much as

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,560
possible for those where we cannot we

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,960
try to you know

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,200
follow templates so the designers team

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,920
made uh documentation documentation

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,440
guidelines

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,839
they don't even know the exact name

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,800
however uh it's a guidelines

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,720
on how to um to write proper

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,960
documentation and we are following it in

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
all

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,200
our our projects and the fact is that we

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,839
are telling public administrators

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,800
to use it as well okay so it's a it's a

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,599
cycle

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,240
and it looks like it's working right now

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
thank you

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,119
thank you so what about

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,480
code quality as in what kind of measures

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,800
are we going to be put in place to

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,640
guarantee a certain amount of quality

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,920
i work in the sector and i can give an

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,400
example so

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,880
soft array doesn't exist yet a

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,839
procurement will be created and a

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,079
big company will come by bid the lowest

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,400
they'll get the job

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,839
make you know write as much as necessary

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
to actually you know pass

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,200
quality and not quite that sorry

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,440
functional tests

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,560
yep and you know ship whatever mess that

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,960
is then

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,359
functionality b needs to be done another

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,839
procurement another big company

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,119
biz lowest monkey patch it until it

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,599
works

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,240
and that goes back in the yeah good

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,520
question

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,079
um of course there are a limited amount

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,200
of things

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
you can do in this way but if you sort

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,800
of

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,599
uh define which are some sort of

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,560
thresholds

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,839
uh in the contract itself then you know

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,880
people start to

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,000
uh work in different fashions

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,280
so um and that's the direction where the

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
guidelines are

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,680
went so as i told before the guidelines

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,119
have these attachments that can be copy

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,440
pasted into a contract

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,240
and most of the attachments are in

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,560
exactly

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,680
trying to solve this problem so they're

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,240
asking for

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,599
for example when you you just don't push

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,640
to master right

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,680
or you just try to use a code review

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,440
process

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,839
you try to um involve as

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,359
as many other people as possible but you

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,560
know what we saw that

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,240
uh in many occasions uh these happened

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,280
in the past where people were

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,599
used to develop in a closed fashion

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,880
so they are they had their own svn or

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,119
git somewhere

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,240
and so they said okay who cares i just

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,400
push there and then

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,599
whenever it's finished i'll i'll just

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
ship my code

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,200
when working in the open this is slowly

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,160
changing

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,119
so we are for example helping public

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,400
administrations

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,440
to understand maybe uh also how to

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,880
i don't know run get pre-ooks

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,000
for for before pushing or to check

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,119
whether you're storing um

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,079
you know passphrases or certificates or

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,560
any kind of sensible information into

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,440
the

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,560
into the repository we're trying to help

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,560
in order to avoid it

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,000
so all of this i'm telling you it's

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,160
already inside the guidelines

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,040
so it will be attached to the contract

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,839
to the contracts

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,040
that you are giving your um your

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,599
developer so

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,880
you know when it's a contract it's it's

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,560
more

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,680
let's say um it's hard to to to avoid it

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,839
and if you do avoid that then

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,520
there may be consequences of course so

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,880
it we are trying to go exactly in that

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,520
direction or to avoid

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,640
whatever we saw up until now uh

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,640
happening every day

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,200
in order to avoid it seeing in the

00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,200
future as well

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,000
so basically the contractors they do the

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,119
lowest possible and

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,319
whatever mess and then ship that but

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,359
nobody sees it if all those

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,240
code that is developed is in the open it

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,160
by default

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,240
starts to make it better even with no

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,440
actions taken exactly

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,839
yeah yeah i feel the same and that's

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,599
exactly the last slide right so

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,359
that's why we're pushing uh

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,040
pub administrators to tell their

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,480
developers and their contractors to go

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,319
open by default okay

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
so from the very first moment and not

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,760
just push as

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,040
a last the last commit and push it in

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,760
the open

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,359
yes if i also may add a comment in the

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,160
procurement process you can see it's

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,720
actually a

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,880
very good advantage to remain maintainer

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,720
of the software you have created

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,400
so there is a good incentive for

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,079
companies to do the right thing because

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,560
it's going to be less expensive also for

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,000
them

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,720
in the long run then they're able to get

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,440
many more contracts

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,400
and leonardo have you ever thought about

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,000
uh

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,119
building up something like a trust pilot

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,640
for citizen with speed so

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,680
you know who is going to give a feedback

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,359
and so maybe the one up

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,800
public administration choose the

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,599
software and the citizen

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,119
is happy maybe you collect the feedback

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,200
so maybe the software is

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,599
good as what service i don't know how

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,160
exactly it's just an idea i got a

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,640
question

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,920
uh i can say that in some projects of

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,280
the italian

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,359
digital transformation team this is

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,000
happening so we have um

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,880
we have a way to get direct feedback

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,160
from

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,760
uh let's say beta testers or

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,680
let's say early stage users and

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,680
however we are thinking about how to

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,640
implement it and scale it

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,599
also for other uh for other projects

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,880
like you said the

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,160
digital identity is one candidate

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,680
and uh yes we think that again

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,000
in this is not our software uses

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,040
it has to be as transparent as possible

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,520
it's a

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,560
public software it's for citizens they

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,319
they are the users

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,160
so we have to collect feedback as much

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
as possible in order to iterate over

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,319
that and

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,119
and release and ship better code okay

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,680
i have two questions for you yeah first

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,520
of all

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:35,280
uh when did it all started

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,240
and second have you experienced any

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,560
resistance from the big it companies

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,440
lobby

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:49,040
okay cool question thanks easy ones

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:53,040
okay um okay so that's the curious thing

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,160
so um the digital administration code

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,560
has been out for

00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,040
quite a while so the new part is

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,440
these new guidelines which again they're

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,920
called guidelines but formally they are

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,200
they're low they're mandatory and they

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,280
have been

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,040
i mean the team started to draft those

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,800
guidelines in 2016

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,839
2017 and they have been published uh

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,599
on may this year in 2019. so this is

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,119
really fresh this is new

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,560
um regarding the second question

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,440
um as a team uh

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,240
we we are in contact with a lot of

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,200
providers

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,520
uh with a lot of again small to medium

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,560
enterprises but also big enterprises

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:44,160
and um we i think i think

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,160
uh we were more afraid of

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,920
you know of having to deal with

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,960
situations than what really

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,800
is happening in reality it's like uh it

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,640
looks like people are sort of

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,079
understanding that this is a low so they

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,119
cannot really

00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,920
escape it so easily and so they are

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,760
re-engineering or rearranging their uh

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,800
the development flow in order to

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,000
comply with the law so i would say yes

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,119
that was the scary part

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,040
of course and but

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,160
we have to know and we know that

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,359
resistance will happen every day however

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,599
we we already put it in place um

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,040
counter measurement counter measures so

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,200
we know how to handle with this

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,200
situation we know how to reply we know

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,480
which you know which document to point

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,440
or which

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,839
load to refer to even if you know it's

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,200
uh

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,880
it's legalese so uh for developers it's

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,520
quite hard to do this work

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,359
however we are for for the moment we are

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,319
handling the situation quite well

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,200
so i i'll be happy to report you back in

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,400
here and

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,040
hopefully everything will be open

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,760
yeah i have uh two questions yep the

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,160
first one

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,040
is uh you said you had put the laws now

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,000
on the git

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,839
as well have you ever had any interest

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,880
from lawmakers to actually use

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,599
git to help them write laws

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,640
and secondly is there or could there be

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,480
any uh

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,000
cooperation with other countries in

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,119
europe for

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,839
the public administration software

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,280
i'm not quite sure i got the second oh

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,880
say they have

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,200
i.t systems in germany or norway can you

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,240
share the same software and cooperate on

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,640
it well

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:32,160
okay so um you me yeah

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,839
first question is um

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,400
yes the answer is yes first of all of

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,160
course

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:43,440
we need to involve a team of tech

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,040
writers in order to help

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,560
lawmakers publish it

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,960
i know it's just md or you know markdown

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,079
or

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,400
rst so it's not so complicated

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,680
however it's you know you're changing

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,040
the way they're trying to

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,720
their their yeah

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,880
exactly so it's it's not so

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,319
straightforward so that's why we

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,200
uh basically use these uh the guidelines

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,640
we wrote and

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,720
also human interfaces so people

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,480
actually tech writers in order to help

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,640
this transition to happen

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
uh but this is really cool i think it's

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,040
it's a way to really

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,599
see the changes and um and and

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,319
many new uh documents many new laws are

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,640
gone

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,319
are doxxed by default okay so they're

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,160
already uh written

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,000
in that way in that format and using

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,680
that technology by default

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,359
and the second one uh it's an

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,480
interesting question uh

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,720
since i would say definitely yes

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,920
since at the end of the at the end of

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,280
the pre this

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,400
all the discussion the software

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,440
is nothing else than any kind of

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,200
representation with

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,560
an open source license so the the

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,240
contract itself

00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,079
between a public and italian public

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,000
administration and a german one

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,119
it's just a license so if you're using

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,520
you know any

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,160
gpl license or any license you want that

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,359
is in the

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,680
osi list then

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,960
why not right and this is exactly the

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,760
direction where we're going

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,560
so this is not an italian you know

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,800
little

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,480
way of handling reuse and it has to be

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,400
just italian it's

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,160
open source so it's free in open source

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,440
so just that's

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,359
of course which is the way to use it um

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,440
probably can be our catalog since our

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,559
catalog is both in italian and english

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,359
uh that's also a way to um

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,200
you know probably spread it around and

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,559
we are in in contact with different

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
uh governments in uh also

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,240
yeah all mostly in the european union

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,480
but also

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,359
let's say outside in order to understand

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,040
how to

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,880
you know work on this specification on

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,920
the public the yms specification sorry

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,880
for that

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,680
there you go and um develop it further

00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,280
and then

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,640
use the catalog why not it's already

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,920
there of course it's free as an open

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,559
source if they want you can implement

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,200
their own

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:10,319
but if they want to use ours that's cool

00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,559
that's it okay thank you if

00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,920
anyone has any queries please ask

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,839
leonardo in person

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:21,839
yeah i'll be here all day so yeah okay

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:21,839
thank you leonardo for that amazing talk

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,319
