Description: 
	Code reviews are not just about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about socialization, learning, and teaching. How can you get the most out of a peer code review and how can you review code without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a better teammate, moreover a valuable community member.

This talk will be an overview of the code review culture as a project team lead and as a community contributor as well. I will be speaking on how to effectively assimilate from the reviews you receive and how to have create more impact on the reviews you give. The talk will expose you to various ideas on how to build a successful code-review culture.
