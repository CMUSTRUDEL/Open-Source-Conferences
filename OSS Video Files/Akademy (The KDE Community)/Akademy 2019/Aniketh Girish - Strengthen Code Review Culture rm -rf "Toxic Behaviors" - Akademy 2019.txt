Title: Aniketh Girish - Strengthen Code Review Culture rm -rf "Toxic Behaviors" - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Code reviews are not just about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about socialization, learning, and teaching. How can you get the most out of a peer code review and how can you review code without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a better teammate, moreover a valuable community member.

This talk will be an overview of the code review culture as a project team lead and as a community contributor as well. I will be speaking on how to effectively assimilate from the reviews you receive and how to have create more impact on the reviews you give. The talk will expose you to various ideas on how to build a successful code-review culture.

thank you for coming and my name is Anna

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,799
Kate and I will be talking about

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:14,639
strengthening code code review culture

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:17,550
in any organizations so first of all I

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,369
have been contributing to KD since 2060

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,900
and since then I was very fond of

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,900
meeting all the KD contributors in back

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,740
in India as well as abroad and I tried

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:36,090
for coming for towards random meetings

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,450
and on fourth and also I tried to go for

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,020
Academy 2018 but unfortunately my visa

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,489
was rejected and sadly I couldn't make

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:53,360
it but then I finally I'm here at

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:58,370
Academy and so happy that I made it and

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,260
was able to meet all of you guys so

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:05,040
again I actually proposed the same talk

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:09,890
last year when our goal was amazingly

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:14,189
focused on streamlined streamlined

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:21,270
contacts like getting in new

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:23,970
contributors so so for the next 30

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,740
minutes we will start will go through a

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:32,189
cube open so story of mine and then

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,670
we'll start on my code review can be

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:40,350
toxic and some something that I call a

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:45,360
requirement for how and why can a code

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:48,030
review be toxic so and we will talk

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,939
about how we can act if a toxicity

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,220
actually exists in any kind of

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:58,439
organization how we can actually try to

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:03,869
get rid of them and maybe how exactly we

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,579
can try to do it and yeah so within a

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,069
different perspective because I have

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,849
been a student I have been a mender and

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:17,790
I have been an organ meat and also

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:20,390
yeah and something similar yeah so

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,120
bye-bye by the end of the day I believe

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,319
yeah since this is the last last talk of

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:32,579
the day I think all will be fine

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:34,530
so we'll yeah so I'm currently doing my

00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:39,180
bachelor's my fine layers in Alberta

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,099
University back in India and so

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,709
basically there is a students community

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:47,659
called for September Radha or right now

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:50,819
it's called am force so basically yeah

00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,310
so this is the group of people students

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,889
we have back there who can who like the

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,189
most of them here actually contributes

00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:02,099
to open source various projects and

00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:05,700
whatnot so we as a group of students

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,530
after classes we spend a lot of a lot of

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,510
time hacking into various projects

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:16,500
contributing to open source and and

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:19,079
stuff related also this kind of

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,780
community grows because the seniors or

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,150
the past students who are actually who

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,940
were actually part of this community

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,489
goes on and amend us the juniors who

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,169
actually joined the current semesters

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:36,569
and that's how this come this small

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:39,510
students community actually coexist and

00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:43,019
it's been ten years since this community

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:49,650
has been contributing to in various open

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:51,329
source organizations and yeah so from

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,010
the beginning of my bachelor's I have

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:58,470
been a student of this community and

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,870
after my first year of bachelors I have

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,970
been a mender of your for few of the

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,889
students here and luckily I could say

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,239
that I brought in almost three students

00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:15,229
from my university to contribute to KD

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,229
and and two of them are here so I am so

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:23,580
[Music]

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:26,090
so starting off in the first year of my

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,090
bachelor's I

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:33,690
it took me two months to get my first

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:39,840
patching and after that I did a Kady

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,940
sock with a stars and then yeah as I

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,460
told I was interested to go and meet all

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:52,530
the KD developers I went to Kady India

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:54,930
Gua T and we met there so after that

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,710
luckily I was selected as a ji-suk

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,300
student for Krista and moving on again

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,669
to 2018

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,580
I actually did a g-shot with new Linux

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:10,470
and was a organ min for KD as well for

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,020
GCI and yeah I have contributed a few

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:23,789
other various projects in open source as

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:26,490
well so our last his major goal was to

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,560
have streamlined onboarding of new

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,259
contributors so are we actually done

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,990
with that or like we actually released

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:41,550
new goals and are we actually done with

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,960
that goal like he'd completed or is

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,080
there more work to be done right and

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,520
yesterday's like there was talk from the

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,440
goalkeepers that like the most of the

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,860
contributors actually had one path

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,270
submitted and after that they were not

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,280
actually capable of going forward right

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:10,669
like most of them dropped out after that

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:17,219
or like and couldn't be a consistent

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:19,889
contributors toward KDE yeah so the

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:26,159
number of people who stuck around after

00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:33,449
that is pretty much less so what can be

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:38,010
the reason for that yeah so I personally

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,700
believe that like most of the

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,860
contributors

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,450
and the community people can actually

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,650
like communicate mostly through code

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:54,030
reviews so if we have a better code

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,190
reviewing system then I believe that we

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,470
can actually make a consistent

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,100
environment for all the new contributors

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,020
to actually stay in in the community and

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:09,900
build a ecosystem which we all love to

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:13,190
work on so basically yeah so let's start

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,130
with what's code review so basically

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:20,640
maybe let's say I saw a bug or I saw a

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:25,890
feature that which I'm like in a project

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,450
which I'm excited about and I want to

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,370
fix that or I want to implement that

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:34,590
feature so basically I actually open a

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,710
ticket I write the code I open a ticket

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,410
and I send it through so there will be

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,700
other community people who actually have

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,660
been working with the project for quite

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:49,490
some time and they will actually review

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:52,800
our work so that's basically code review

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:55,410
yeah so like let's say the one not one

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,120
of code review basically if we have an

00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,760
IRC channel or something similar

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,680
we have a group walkthrough of the bug

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,930
like let's say if I just opposed that

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,360
bug in bug or a feature in our IRC

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,810
channel and the team actually goes

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,680
through it and try to see like oh if

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:18,840
that bug actually exists or something

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:22,920
similar like yeah and and the

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,010
contributor actually resolves that but

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:32,760
or gets the feature done and sends in a

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:35,180
patch and if there is a like let's say a

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,530
[Music]

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,700
person who is actually familiar with the

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,650
project can actually both collaborate

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,680
with him or maybe the maintainer can

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,050
actually if he's reviewing the patch set

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,380
he can they can both do a pair

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,930
programming as well and that's how

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,220
of the time it has done and at the end a

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:04,710
pull request is send and it's merged so

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:07,470
the Plus Ones of code review as we all

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,060
know the knowledge and experience is

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,190
shared between the new contributor and

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,420
people who is actually reviewing the

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:18,150
code right and it should invoke a sense

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,980
of mentorship between the people in the

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,130
community or let's say the project

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,580
maintainer of the project team and it

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:30,210
should like enrich the student not

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:33,720
students I mean the new contributors to

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,830
actually come in and work well in an

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,500
ecosystem like this

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,800
and also there will be a difference of

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,920
opinion anywhere in any community so it

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,200
helps to actually foster debates and it

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,540
it helps people to actually understand

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,720
what others think of the particular

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:57,660
issue and how different it is from their

00:09:51,720 --> 00:10:02,510
views and help helping student helping

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,640
people to have to do debates and

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,940
communicate well within the community it

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,170
brings in decision making skills which

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:16,230
is a highly effective quality in any

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,180
contributor in a community yeah and of

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:25,560
course the quality of the code is that

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:28,830
will be well maintained and yeah so this

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,770
is therefore the crux of this whole talk

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,470
and code review as it is can bring in

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:40,290
toxic unsupportive environment if it's

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:43,950
not done right so this talk I have split

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,610
into two a code review which is which in

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:51,840
a helpful scenario and not in on like in

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:55,260
an unhelpful scenario as well so you

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:59,930
could see that like there's a small

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:02,910
snippet of get a pull request chat so

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,500
there's an over or or whelming with with

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,660
an avalanche of comment comments in the

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,250
first one

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,650
and in the second one you can see that

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,410
just one line one line and says that

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,870
looked like you you're checked in some

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,110
trailing space on several lines of your

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,790
chain set our cell guide specifies no

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,260
trailing whitespace can you take a look

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:29,180
at this so isn't that better rather than

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,250
sending a lot of unwanted comments like

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,740
that and it creates a negativity for the

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,740
coming contributor as well and it will

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:46,600
also saying extra space extra space

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,600
extra space for every

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,779
[Music]

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,419
[Music]

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,330
basically our idea is to actually foster

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:58,330
all these new contributors and actually

00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:01,620
start helping them so let's say if he's

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:04,450
an e or she is an new contributor and

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,880
you see a quite a bit of potential for

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,980
him to be a a consistent contributor

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,500
let's say we start by the second way and

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:19,390
if you know him better then let's start

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:23,650
by the first way so and this is another

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:26,200
scenario where we can see that like

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:30,400
let's not leave any contributors hanging

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:33,580
without a comment as we in our like

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,320
cady's students community we have always

00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,940
been saying that commits early and

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,800
commits often so something similar

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:44,290
communicate well and communicate often

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,510
so it might help if each of the students

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,670
each of the students are contributors to

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:54,600
actually get close with the community

00:13:48,670 --> 00:14:06,070
and start working consistently and I

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:08,770
hope it's visible yeah so passing off

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:12,340
opinion as a fact might be an unhelpful

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:14,560
and for that it's better to back up your

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,410
claims with the documentation reference

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,740
or style guide or whatever you have any

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,650
PA documents or whatever share it with

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:29,520
them rather than passing off your

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:32,380
opinion as a fact because yeah

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:36,730
don't make it your review see preview

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:40,980
seekers problem that he didn't find a

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,980
good reference and

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:52,140
so so basically asking devs to fix the

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,550
problem that they haven't caused might

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:58,710
be taken a bit negatively so it's always

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:02,160
nice to actually like let's say for an

00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,540
example an unhelpful way was I have

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,090
always hated how this function is

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,700
structured can you fix it since you are

00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,970
modifying it in a way so it can create a

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,610
bit of a negative tone for the

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,380
contributor so let's say like looks good

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,320
to me will create a separate ticket for

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,910
crate clean this file up so it might

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,990
actually invoke a sense in the new

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,090
contributor to actually go and fix that

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:36,810
ticket as well because he has already

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:40,440
worked in it so asking judgemental

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,390
questions can also be toxic so like

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,410
let's say if you are something like why

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:48,960
didn't you just do that or do this let's

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,210
say if you asked like you can do this

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,360
and that which has the benefit of that

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,720
and this so that could that could give

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,940
him more like it's a part of mentorship

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,070
which gives you more which gives the

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,990
contributor a bit more opportunity to

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:10,110
learn and understand what he is doing

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,480
and be a consistent player for the whole

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:18,450
community and benefit us as a community

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:23,850
as well being sarcastic can obviously be

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:28,470
taken offensive and it it's not always

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,240
well right thing to do so again for an

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,800
example if you asked like did you even

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,070
test this code before you push it or

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,680
send it over for review again that can

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:42,600
create a notion of disrespect for

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:46,110
contributor and it's always perfect to

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,900
us that your code breaks during XYZ test

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:53,130
or whatever or edge cases can you

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:55,430
address those issues so that gives him

00:16:53,130 --> 00:17:02,870
more advantage over the

00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:04,700
he has written as well and get like the

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:12,050
contributor gets a better hold of what

00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:14,240
he's trying to do so always use a

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:17,089
question or recommendation to drive a

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,000
dialogue or rather than just passing a

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:23,410
strict comment for instance put all

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,240
these translations into a constant file

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,760
it's not I feel it's not right

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,530
so instead ask a question and maybe

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,260
something like what would you think

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,470
about pull putting these translations

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,810
into a constant file there are lot and

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,710
that's there's a lot and separate file

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,690
might make sense so it creates a kind of

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:49,220
collaboration between the contributor

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:52,580
and the team and it might actually help

00:17:49,220 --> 00:18:01,690
the community as such to bring a lot of

00:17:52,580 --> 00:18:06,080
other contributors so there might be

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:08,870
high performance in your team which may

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,090
be doing some toxic behavior within the

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,450
team and sometimes you are reluctant to

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,380
actually talk to them in person and fix

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:22,010
what's wrong so high performance is not

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,830
not an excuse and if there is some kind

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:28,280
of such toxicity inside your team or

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,820
inside your community it's always it can

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,460
always affect the entire team and it's

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:39,770
always better to fix what actually is

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:43,910
there and move on also this is something

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:47,270
of a greater concern that you might

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,310
itself be a part of this issue so it

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:53,780
depends on how we actually address this

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:58,580
case and be a better better quality

00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:02,300
four-year community and as I told for

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:06,230
example having supporting a toxic high

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:09,140
performant developer can also affect

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,710
your team and low-grade it's more

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,630
of your team always your focus should be

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,030
on creating a supportive environment if

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,570
for instance if you are a maintainer of

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:24,590
your project or you are a team lead it

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:27,470
or even a developer the way you can

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:30,110
contribute to a community to keep its

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,059
morale always high is to always

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:37,630
encourage people to have a supportive

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:43,520
environment in your inter project so

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:46,730
yeah few of the helpful ways to actually

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:51,230
help and hold onto the new contributors

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:53,809
is not to micromanage always ask

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:58,059
questions and don't just pass off a

00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:02,200
comment always encourage for a debate a

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:04,790
point over resources if they're stuck

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:10,520
respect and respond to every comments

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,660
that there and yeah so if somebody is

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,610
seeking for help

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,600
use that opportunity to actually teach

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,760
them and don't show off so that they

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,230
will be a consistent contributor and

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,559
they can move on with the project later

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,740
on and as I told don't excuse any

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:32,929
unhelpful or behavior as the it's the

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:37,280
way things are and and this might be the

00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:40,940
most difficult part maybe asking the

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,330
people who are toxic to be aware of the

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,850
fact so you have you don't have to be

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,380
afraid of that it's always better to

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,919
tell them that this is causing a problem

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:56,900
in the team and you can actually change

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,760
and that way the that contributor

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,320
actually could evolve as a person and

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,240
help the community in different ways and

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,070
for admins or a team lead it's always

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,630
better to listen to your team's concern

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:15,340
if such toxicity actually exists and

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:18,550
yeah so I'm not pulsing any content or

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,190
anything like that just asking all to be

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,550
like welcoming and mindful of their tone

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,950
and it's all just a trivial

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:30,410
communication stuff that we can actually

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,950
take care of and bring a huge change

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,450
into our community and hold on to the

00:21:32,950 --> 00:22:00,140
like new contributors that actually

00:21:35,450 --> 00:22:03,890
comes to our community I happen to be

00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,230
fortunate enough to be our viewer for an

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:10,420
open source period which gets lots of

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:16,370
new contributors sending poor requests a

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:18,770
few times when I can't return has many

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:23,570
many different issues I'm thinking of

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:25,520
the extra space but I think of all

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,840
comments being completely different

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:33,620
stuff a certain feel like I prefer to

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,400
limit myself to commenting at most five

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:42,460
issues with the changes and if there's

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:45,890
more just say no only five wait for the

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,630
person to fix them and then review again

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:52,070
the rest of the thing I'm not sure

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:56,350
however if it's better to I I feel that

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:58,760
if I have too much feedback it may

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,430
affect the morale of the person

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,670
what was your phone I think the same

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,350
like for let's see if the contributor is

00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,170
not well-versed with your project or

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,820
he's actually learning to try and

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,400
contribute to it or maybe the technology

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,140
stack is really new to him it will yeah

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,680
the way you do it will be really helpful

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,740
like a smaller set of reviews and he can

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,660
work on it and get back to you again and

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,330
if that's fixed then you can give the

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,680
next set of tasks so it's basically I

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,050
feel like it's kind of a meandering

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,090
process like you are giving a particular

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,590
set of tasks to be completed in a work

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,180
which is he Act which he or she is

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,790
actually interested

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,130
and he can complete that and he can come

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:46,910
back to you again so I think that's

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:49,580
right way to do a code review my input

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,050
being a non coder is if there's

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,110
something that's about bothering you

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:57,520
like extra spaces all the time then

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,900
instead of criticizing every new

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,290
contributor about there extra spaces

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,990
that you write the bot that helps all of

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,760
the contributors fix all of the extra

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,630
spaces cause you probably have some in

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,930
your code too

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:14,060
you just didn't catch up we have

00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,820
something like garland that check your

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,360
quotes index maybe extra space it gives

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:25,090
you a warning inside the code itself

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,090
yeah yeah any more questions

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,660
what do you think is the best way to

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:41,030
ping people who haven't responded in a

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,070
while so like if you ask for feedback

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,300
and you haven't gone yet what's the best

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:49,010
way someone who's experienced in the

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:52,250
project to ask that what whether they're

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:55,880
still working on this or if they have

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,470
something new to offer if I got your

00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,480
question right like oh yeah I think if

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,500
oh sorry I wasn't speaking to the mic

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,330
yeah sorry oh sorry so like if if a new

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,370
contributor creates a pull request with

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:11,930
a new features and you request changes

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:15,440
but they don't get back to what's the

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:19,340
best way to sort of nudge them or to ask

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,170
for an update of some sort with it

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,290
without being coming across as rude or

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,910
pushy I don't know I've always found

00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:31,160
that very hard on projects to figure out

00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:32,720
the right timing or so like are you

00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,060
asking if somebody actually sends a past

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:45,020
request like requests up

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:46,520
but maybe reply okay so what should be

00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:51,740
our response like other new contributors

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:54,680
response what's what's the best way to

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:57,860
sort of trying and deal with that do you

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,390
close the floor requests and say we

00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,250
can't do this at the moment the code

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,010
base you worked on it's too different or

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,110
leave it open or leave a comment or send

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,040
an email I always found it difficult to

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:13,640
figure out give any recommendations or

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:16,010
like most of the time if for my for my

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,390
personal cases like when I contributed

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,180
to multiple various open source

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,820
organization even I have like gone

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,460
through such cases where like I have

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,050
sent a pull request and like maybe took

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,200
more than one to two months to get

00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:32,930
feedback on that so basically what I

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,260
used to do was that if I have a new

00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:39,410
change like let's say I send a first

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,710
pull request and again after sometimes I

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,810
didn't get a feedback back so I will

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,530
again maybe traverse through the code

00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:50,840
again and if I find something I will fix

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,850
that and again send the same like fix

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,830
that and send the pull request so at

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:58,340
that point I will act again actually

00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:01,760
ping them and ask them if they are free

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:06,200
to give a response back so basically

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,060
it's from my context of the talk I'm

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,530
asking all the code reviewers to

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:15,710
actually respond to whatever comments

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,810
they get so that the contributes don't

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:28,520
we don't let all these contributors

00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:31,610
hanging we have a bot doing this so if T

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,470
if the developer comments and there is

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,920
no feedback within months like no

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,900
response to suggested changes but that

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,210
things to people hey are you still

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,310
working on this patch then does it

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:47,410
second time and if there's still no

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,410
response then it Rob's the patch

00:27:51,710 --> 00:28:01,390
any more questions I think it's time

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:06,729
thank you any good for your talk

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,729
