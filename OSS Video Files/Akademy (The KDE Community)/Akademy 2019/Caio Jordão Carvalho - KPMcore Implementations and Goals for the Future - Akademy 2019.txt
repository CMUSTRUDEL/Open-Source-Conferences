Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	In the last two years, kpmcore library has received a lot of new patches and updates that improved the functionalities of the library. This library is mainly focused on providing partitioning processes and disk operations. As a Season of KDE student, I have contributed to the improvement of SMART support and helped in the implementation of the KAuth support to improve the authentication routines. During Google Summer of Code, my goal was focused on finishing LVM Volume Group support and start implementing MDRAID. The purpose of this presentation is to explain some of my contributions and talk about future goals for the library.
