00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:20,130
hi I'm Camilla and I was here like in

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,320
our Academy two years ago and I was

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,099
presenting the music player I was

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,429
working on back then it was called back

00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:31,380
then last year I came back because I

00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:35,160
modified the player and now was before I

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,000
was using kid widgets and last year he

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,879
was now using kid quit controls and then

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,600
the story of the my project is when

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:50,340
begins so this is a quick overview of

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,340
things that we'll talk about in this

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,430
presentation so about the motivation of

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,090
the project and the history what is the

00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,910
project

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,160
what is based on what are the parts of

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,240
the project the current stay the goals

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,890
the plans the roadmap and there is no

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,470
time for questions so we'll skip that

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:17,220
and then we'll give you some info so I

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,570
was telling you and the project started

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,150
with a music player that was called BAE

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:26,220
then there was problem with the name etc

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:29,610
and it was changed to babe a way as you

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,350
want you please to pronounce it anyone

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,990
else before using cute widgets then he

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,759
was moved to keep quick controls and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,780
Timmy was eventually moved to use

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,100
Kitakami so that's kind of the history

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,689
of the project and then the motivation

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:52,729
was to have a an ecosystem before that

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:55,890
and when I was working on weight I was

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,450
creating components and then I start

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,659
working on another application that was

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,280
called picks and index and I noticed

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,350
there was duplicating they were because

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,049
like one control I was using in Bay I

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,030
was also using an index so I move all

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,880
these common controls to a single place

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,390
and then that was called Maui kid

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,510
so the motivation was to have an

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,280
ecosystem to help tie integration and to

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:26,170
have a cohesive design between their

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,140
applications there were ten eventually

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,780
the motivation and the goal was to work

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,230
on convergence because of kilogram e92

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,030
c2 because then the music player and the

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,780
other two applications now were working

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,710
also on Android so the motivation is to

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,930
have conversion cross-platform

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:51,270
multi-platform and that leads to have

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:56,050
data that I think between devices and

00:02:51,270 --> 00:03:03,160
also responsive design so this is like a

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:11,400
timeline then this way and now a kid is

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:14,650
born you can strain into my project and

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,430
then just this year the whole Maui

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:22,740
project was curated into the tree and

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:25,780
now it's part of the community project

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,840
so this implies some refactoring

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:33,610
transformation because before my kid was

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,670
like I was doing components on my wiki

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,700
that were already available on kirigami

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:43,240
so now kid my kid uses a lot of kirigami

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,650
and just up from top all right specific

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:50,350
components for the Moriya applications

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,930
so as I was telling you now the project

00:03:50,350 --> 00:04:02,020
is in queue a little kitty you know the

00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:03,970
sources are the embedment instance so

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,730
what is the Maui project

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,470
so the Maui pressure essentially is a

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,690
group of tools working together to

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,420
achieve a multi platform in comparison

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,480
Biderman the Maui project runs on

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:21,640
Android and Linux desktops and also on

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,990
plasma mobile it is based on cute quick

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,660
contrast to

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:34,620
kirigami also the Android API and the TV

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,970
frankerz file uses interfaces between

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,680
different libraries depending on the

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:47,530
target system for example and Linux uses

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:50,650
the kyo attica etc and reuses the api so

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,680
if we want to have Maui running also on

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:59,500
Windows then we will have another

00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:02,620
interfaces same format on iOS etc so the

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,300
apps are being shipped by default on the

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,310
distribution that is called matrix I

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,300
don't know if you have heard of it and

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,030
they are packet packet as up images in a

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:19,449
few apps also going to be cheap on the

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:23,560
plasma my images so as we click this is

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:25,750
like what is base home now I'm going to

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,810
talk to you about the parts that

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,690
compound the Maui project which are the

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,580
applications the library is the services

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,880
the framework and the human interface

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:42,430
guidelines and right now we have a

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,090
applications we have pics that is the

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:52,240
image gallery viewer boo that is a note

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:54,880
taking application and also it tries to

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,150
work as a pocket like you can collect

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,580
links from the internet and the idea is

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,340
to cut all these applications to sync

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,409
the data between devices so if you have

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,930
around you are under fine the same that

00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:11,289
is going to be shown in your just a

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:14,259
computer we also have commander that is

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:17,289
a terminal emulator we have noted that

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:22,000
as a simple text editor library that is

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:26,520
a PDF viewer dialer that is a contacts

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,630
application a weight a music player and

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,030
index that is the file manager these are

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,420
some

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,130
screenshots of the this.index the file

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,060
manager that with the application and

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:47,100
the image viewer and these are the other

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:51,080
applications so all these applications

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,500
run on Android and also on plasma mobile

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,830
we have a few libraries and we have a

00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,210
lab ready lift up there essentially what

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:06,240
does is allow us to sync data between

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:09,270
devices using right now you're using

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,430
next cloud to do so so we have web that

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:17,880
and see that wait up for syncing files

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:21,990
and to see that for syncing contacts and

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,410
eventually also calendar we have also

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,720
another library that is tagging that

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,350
allows to share metadata tag in between

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,060
applications so as you have attack in

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:42,780
index you can also see the attack be

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:47,370
shown in pigs also in weight etc so the

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:50,460
services are ready-made interfaces to

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,550
the target system so it's very easy with

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,430
Maui kit they are framework to for

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,510
example an Android get a native

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:05,010
notification to share they're not

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:08,250
sharing dialog to get the contacts from

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:12,600
the Android API same for Linux we also

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:18,090
have the maoist oil that we use on

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,580
nitrox on android and plasma mobile and

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,530
also on other distributions we use the

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:27,750
default style that will be they were

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:30,540
from plasma we have the FM that is file

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,650
management tools the interfaces we kill

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:37,380
for linux and we have a simple

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,200
implementation on android we also have a

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,330
store they allow this application to

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,210
have content to get content from the

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,510
stores and it is based on attica both

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,510
for

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,290
and finally we have an editor there's a

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,120
simple text editor and it's a back-end

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,070
right now we were working on how this EQ

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:04,400
syntax highlighter to work also on

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:10,540
Android and the framework the framework

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:15,760
is basically Maui key which is the

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:18,560
composition of all these UI controls and

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,170
those conscious follow their Maui high

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,940
the human interface guidelines and we

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,390
also have them plated in abstract

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,180
classes

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,220
so basically when the project was being

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,610
created there was this question of why

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,030
to have another framework when they're

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,360
already was yummy and basically the

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,660
answer was always the market is a

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,270
specialization of kirigami instead of

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:48,080
being white proper purpose is very

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,790
specific so it introduces extra

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,760
components and also quickly clearly

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:59,320
create my way up so we Monique is you

00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:04,580
create Maori apps so the current state

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,280
so they're all the applications except

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:11,600
the terminal emulator are running on

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,340
Android was mama while and Linux for

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,970
release can be they there is already

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:22,040
indexed for manager pics and the music

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,700
player wait for beta is dialer there is

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,520
nota

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,010
there is bull and Commander info alphas

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,410
library all of the applications are

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:34,760
working on suspect just some are missing

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,060
some features this is an screen server

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,550
of the file manager running on desktop

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,000
and on Android this is actually a

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,000
screenshot

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:53,580
so the goals for the project are the

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:56,279
word in convergence we really want to

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,960
have a single application in Pali index

00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,050
to be powerful enough to be run on

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,660
desktops and also on your phone so

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,899
instead of having to have dolphin just

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,510
running on on your personal computer and

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:13,560
a solution running on your phone we want

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:18,240
to have a single one we also have want

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,880
to have consistency in our ecosystem and

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,339
I think that is based a lot on how we

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,660
gonna work on a human interface

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:29,130
guidelines we have to have one to have

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,420
time digression between their

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:36,959
applications and their line system and

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:40,560
want to keep working on clasp in cross

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:51,110
platform not only on Android and Linux

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:53,640
but maybe expand to Windows and finally

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:59,779
for us a bit important that is trying to

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,779
have a small and cohesive look and feel

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,089
and this is like a long-term plans or

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,330
something that is already in discussion

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:13,350
and we want to work on a launcher in a

00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:15,060
shell that works for target platforms so

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,240
you will work for Android for plus my

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,690
mobile and desktop the same launcher in

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,570
jail

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,910
we also be working on refining our human

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,300
interface guidelines we want to work

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:32,430
further than the integration with a TV

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,290
frameworks file libraries and find ways

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,100
to make the program more available to

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:40,920
the users for the users to play with it

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,370
because right now the generated apk

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,490
packages are not available on any store

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:50,329
they are like sometimes push to github

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,329
repository

00:12:51,630 --> 00:13:00,250

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,720
future and we will make in official

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:11,110
releases for the applications they are

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:15,120
ready a polishing the sinking services

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,070
to make it as reliable as possible and

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,720
we will continue contribute to upstream

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:27,010
libraries used by Maori like kirigami

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:30,790

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:35,650
