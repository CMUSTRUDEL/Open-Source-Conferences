	00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,750
so for those who don't know having been

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,700
following fabrication well enough there

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,860
is currently a something in the region

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,280
of 10,000 line patch up there that I

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,080
would like all of you to review thank

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,609
you that's my presentation now know so

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,529
what I've been doing is working on

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:28,590
bringing K hot new stuff kicking and

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:33,510
screaming into the bow into the 2010s

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:38,129
finally that we're leaving them so but

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,200
yeah first a bit about me I've been yeah

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,430
my name is Ben Lena to origins and I

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,649
have been a member of KDE since 2002 I

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,750
first Academy was in Glasgow where we

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:54,809
got little cups plastic cups which I'm

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,460
sure everybody still has yeah there you

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,469
go

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:03,750
oh yeah sometimes on a bird I am an

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,229
employee of blue systems and it's under

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:14,189
that guys that I've been working on this

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:18,780
project so a little bit of history we

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,869
have a few frameworks as it exists we

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,009
have had antic air for quite a long time

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,290
now it it's being called Attica since

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,750
forever I have still no idea why it's

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,090
called that if anyone knows please find

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,009
me later it would be nice to know I'm

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,380
sure there's some kind of historical

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:43,979
reference there somewhere but yes also

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:48,479
its Attica is a very straightforward

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,430
wrapper around an xml-based content

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,610
delivery system called the open

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,110
collaboration services we then have Kane

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:02,939
used of core which is the extraction

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:06,240
based around items of content which can

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,429
use either Attica or a static XML system

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,739
which means you don't have to have some

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,420
magic server to operate with it Kay

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,380
develop uses here for template

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:19,830
for example then there is what is then

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,870
called K new stuff because it is we had

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,280
to keep binary compatibility it really

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,940
wants to be called something else

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,550
it's the qwidget based UI on top of k

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:35,100
new stuff core and then the very bad the

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,000
the things that i did in 2000 end of

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,690
2017 called k new stuff quick which was

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,250
just a list and an item which you could

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:50,819
feed a KN SRC file which is the config

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,019
files that define what you're looking

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,819
for and it will just show that then in a

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,700
list and you could interact with it that

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:04,400
way through is really really simple

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:09,269
which of course wasn't quite enough so

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,209
for our server we have the store doc a

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,709
deed a dog which used to be built on top

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,200
of what was called the hive or one

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:24,239
framework it was run by Frank re-check

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:29,459
who was here yesterday yeah it's it was

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:35,310
fairly recently taken over the entirety

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:42,269
of the KD store was acquired by by blue

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:44,700
systems but in cooperation with the AV

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:49,530
board at the time and put into a

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,930
separate legal entity which then takes

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,030
care of all of the legalities around

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,660
that which means that all of the content

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,220
is now controlled by the Eevee but

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,780
because of personal data protection

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:07,170
legislation not owned by the Eevee the

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,200
new the old framework could not for

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:14,370
various reasons be released into free

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,419
software but the new version can and was

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:22,789
it's hosted on

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:24,889
on a bikini dog fabricated even sorry oh

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,860
yeah I'm jumping ahead of myself there

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:31,280
all of that means that we have all of

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,400
the control we need to actually work on

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,060
this stuff ourselves if we want to which

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,389
our vacation becomes very important

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,220
because yeah there's a couple of details

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:48,949
I'll show later on why that's important

00:04:43,220 --> 00:05:00,710
so the new things that I've been working

00:04:48,949 --> 00:05:02,629
on since it was low battery earlier but

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,900
yeah obviously I didn't tell anyone

00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:08,030
because I'm a clever person yeah all of

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,810
this is now queued quick you will

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:14,199
already be aware of the download the

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,469
star buttons that say download whatever

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:22,039
in various things it's the current most

00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:23,719
used bits of k new stuff so of course we

00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:29,330
need a cute quick version of that I know

00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:33,229
that tyover has created some thing which

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,819
kind of wraps the widgets and he was

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:39,319
looking forward to being able to replace

00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:41,960
that case yeah there is a widget in

00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:46,310
plasma which is our lovely cute quick

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,789
based framework somewhere and with this

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,000
we'll be able to replace that that is

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:56,810
what the new dialog looks like it's

00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,349
equivalent to what was the old download

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:05,060
dialog and widget and I'm going to tell

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:07,699
you that you shouldn't use it there is a

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,469
bit of cleverness called a question

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:15,229
asker and a question listener which

00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:18,199
forwards questions from the UI less core

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:23,889
yeah and it allows you to just ask

00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,889
things and get get answers you know

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:32,870
in an asynchronous fashion or

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:37,949
synchronous if you so desire that is he

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,630
existing lists and items which have had

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,630
a bit of work there wasn't the

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,479
description weren't there the sort of

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,889
the thumbnails are a little more of

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,820
nicely laid out and the categories

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:56,010
filtering options weren't there before

00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:01,070
either the page is what you should be

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:05,870
using it's effectively the same thing

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:09,840
that exists in the dialog except it's

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,580
you know much more how we build apps

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,060
these days you've got a page and you dig

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:23,310
into them all of the new all of the new

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:25,710
what are they called the new system

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:30,750
settings pages are all based around this

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:34,139
similar concept that is actually a KCM

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,639
grid view so it looks and feels very

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,860
much like any other

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,030
KCM so it integrates very nicely for

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,070
that if you then click on any of it that

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:49,050
is what it'll show you've got the

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:53,010
details of any one entry shown in a in a

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:56,010
much more pleasant fashion than what we

00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:01,080
had before because whereas before we

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:03,330
used a very simple widget which was you

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,789
know a relic of the early two-thousands

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,360
so that layout is very cramped and it's

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:13,979
yeah it looks old it could probably be

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:18,510
fixed but yeah we were doing things with

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:22,110
it anyway so ended up building something

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:24,659
which is for people who use discover

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,690
will seem familiar somehow

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,490
a lot of this is intended to also get

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,579
merged back into discover there's a

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,600
couple of changes but otherwise it is

00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:40,340
effectively the discover components

00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,950
and then something completely new which

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,730
I was surprised to discover k new stuff

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,100
never understood the concept of comments

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:51,440
it does now so of course we have

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,190
comments and that's one of those things

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,040
where having having it controlled by

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,920
Kady it's very handy because it was not

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:05,360
before possible to read those in a

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,790
proper fashion and we can now and then

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,640
yes there's the author component which

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,590
is not what you see there it's what

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,070
provides the information I will show you

00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:22,220
how that's useful slightly you know in a

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:26,930
moment so to use a few of these

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:28,970
components you've got the button which

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,740
is supposed to be the simplest way of

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:36,320
accessing any of this you just import

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,690
okay new stuff you instantiate a button

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,550
and you tell it what the config file

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,050
you'd like to see is you don't have to

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,240
know the path you just give it the name

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,710
of the configuration file which is

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,860
exactly the same way that you would

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,580
instantiate it as a widget just in cute

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:57,290
quick instead then there is the list

00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:01,390
which is a similar sort of thing it

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:04,460
allows you to use something very simple

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,640
if you only need the ability to just

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,430
show a list of items you can use the

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,910
list and peruse uses it for example my

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:16,520
comic book reader uses that instead of

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,840
page because it's much too elaborate

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:26,000
much too verbose for browsing the books

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,680
in the store and it just gives you the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,590
ability to download things and then if

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,420
you click on any of them it'll show you

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:36,230
it'll give you a list of the install

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,010
files from the thing that was good that

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,600
is the page which is the one that you

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,089
are all supposed to be using for

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,850
integration instead of the button if

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:55,459
instead of the dialogue if the button is

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:58,839
not sufficient for your users its

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:02,329
intended to be about as simple to use as

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,059
the as the button but of course because

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:08,269
it is a page it is slightly more

00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:11,869
involved the button takes care of

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:13,730
delaying the initialization of the new

00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:16,189
stove engine which is a really heavy

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,089
operation because it does serve talk

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:21,949
with the server to fetch basic

00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:26,689
information about what your what do you

00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:28,339
like to look at which means that this

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:32,749
looks a little bit involved but the idea

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:36,829
is that you just instantiate a page and

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:38,929
then you don't tell it what your

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:45,739
configuration file is until you actually

00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:48,079
push that onto your page stack and then

00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:50,929
there is that author component I was

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,309
talking about before the idea there is

00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:59,299
that I mean you some of you will have

00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:02,449
noticed that in K about information

00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:06,860
there is four four people you can add an

00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:11,829
OC as user name the idea is that you

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:14,660
should be able to use this without

00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:17,149
really knowing anything other than that

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:22,339
user name we have the concept of a

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:27,049
default engine or of a default content

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:30,439
provider which basically means that that

00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:34,189
bit there shouldn't be necessary

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:37,279
it's also why that bit there also is not

00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:39,169
necessary unless you actually decide to

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,980
point it at something other than the KDE

00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:45,259
store the idea is that you can then you

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,529
give it your you give it the user name

00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:52,339
which you can get from here about Delta

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:56,899
and then you will get an avatar you'll

00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:59,630
get the author's homepage name all of

00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,430
that sort of lovely information we

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,110
we would all like to have in the about

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,399
dialogues but which currently isn't

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:13,790
possible because it involves pulling in

00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:17,480
quite a lot of stuff and yeah so a demo

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:28,779
very quick just to show you that it

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:28,779
actually works so so right

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,209
hmm and then you've got some comments

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,060
and some reviews which then oh yes it

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,560
also fetches that dynamically so if you

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,589
don't have an internet connection it'll

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,029
just show the username and the user sort

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:56,050
of you know the the game break sort of

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:57,550
user icon thing and which it then also

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:02,250
shows when you scroll through the list

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,079
until it's loaded the information and

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:09,819
[Music]

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:11,380
yeah and of course because this is very

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,360
visual information we've got a couple of

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,819
many of you modes as well so you've got

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,480
something that looks a little nicer if

00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:23,380
you have really heavy visual content so

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,519
in and abets asked if we could have

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,350
something which was better for

00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,819
wallpapers for example because those

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:32,860
little icons are very very tiny so we

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:35,740
came up with a layout that's more

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:40,079
friendly for visually heavy content

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:47,949
which then is this one and of course the

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:51,639
really really small just an icon and and

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:54,699
the name View mode oh yes and the button

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,079
which just loads the dialog initializes

00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,009
the engine and operates it in the same

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,009
way as what you just saw

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,379
[Music]

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,589
and there we are

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,300
that was hot new stuff and it was real

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:25,920
quick so we have plenty of time for

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:29,040
questions and we'll start with a Leo so

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,620
question is why we have that space on

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,100
the Left why doesn't it need to have a

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,279
single one line and taking out 30% of

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,880
the screen and let me just pull that one

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,370
up again

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:51,209
OOP it's a way very wide pager oh the oh

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:56,399
the that bit there that bit yep that bit

00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:59,310
there that's a sidebar this is not what

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:07,110
you will see in your application the bit

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:09,810
that's page is the bit there that's a

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,440
page so yeah you won't see that unless

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:17,810
you decide to have a full width always

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:23,040
on top signed by in your kirigami

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:27,089
application that's just it's yes yeah

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:32,850
that's not the cane use of dialog I have

00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:36,029
named it badly it is a test tool is it

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,820
possible to include new comments or we

00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:41,760
would be possible to include new

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:47,220
comments on the comment comment section

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:53,399
right so currently no and the reason is

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:57,029
spam we have in the the OCS API and

00:16:53,399 --> 00:17:00,899
Kony's of itself is able to allow you to

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:03,029
make new comments the problem is that we

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:09,000
have had that API tabled on the server

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:11,010
and we have never had so much spam it is

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,870
we'd never thought it would be a problem

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,889
basically we thought we were too small

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:19,339
as it turns out that isn't true

00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:24,049
so kind of a nice thing to know that we

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:26,089
are sufficiently large provider of the

00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:28,429
content on the internet that spammers

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,970
want to target us but the problem is

00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:34,850
that we then can't allow people to do

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:40,999
comments over the API as it exists right

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:44,240
now it's also why some people had the

00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:48,259
need of doing uploads over the OCS APRI

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,169
create actual new content items it's the

00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:53,360
same issue and we had a couple of ways

00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:56,539
like we've got a couple of ideas for how

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,610
we might deal with this so like there is

00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:06,590
the idea of perhaps doing a network of

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:11,090
trust where if you are vetted by by a

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:14,419
set of people as this is a person who is

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:19,429
actually okay for providing content then

00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:23,509
you can be allowed to do so a smaller

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:25,730
set verifications step four comment

00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:29,450
perhaps because they would not you know

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,509
they're a slightly less crazy sort of

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:36,860
thing to be allowed people to do because

00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:41,090
they don't provide potentially damaging

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:43,789
content and for example but but yeah

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:51,019
it's a it's a problem the API can do it

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:55,070
it is effectively a social issue this is

00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:57,379
a really quick one since the content is

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,860
now provided in a page I think that I

00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:05,379
love from a design point of view since

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:09,289
now in the new pretty redesign K CMS

00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:12,440
they actually do support multiple level

00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:16,789
of pages in them

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,309
did you already look into or do you

00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:22,429
think it makes sense to actually have

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:27,519
all the get all new stuff content in

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,519
case EMS actually been

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,680
been in a page in the same level as the

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,400
estimation so so like looking field and

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:43,360
you do get off new stuff and you see and

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,940
exactly same looking grid of things but

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,100
that that comes online instead of I

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,030
haven't looked at actually integrating

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,940
it into any case EMS but the reason for

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,220
using the KCM grid view for this is

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,780
precisely that that it is supposed to be

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:04,240
yeah yeah yeah having like actually

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:11,260
doing a test to find out whether that

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:12,760
works would be quite nice yeah I said to

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,840
to question is there is there a

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,790
possibility to tag things and the and a

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,310
remark is that you give exact numbers

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,650
while many app stores they give they

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,390
give approximations to to not make

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,150
people addicted or feel that these

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,460
numbers are meaningful is it have you

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,590
thought about sort of blinding this a

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,480
little say less than a thousand between

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,120
1,000 and 10,000 or something

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,990
just to avoid this very concrete there's

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,210
12 downloads which is I have frankly I

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,800
hadn't thought of it but yeah that's

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,660
actually a good point that would be a

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,660
nice thing to add on top what's the

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:53,530
first one tagging tagging right yeah so

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,040
one of the large things that I did last

00:20:53,530 --> 00:21:01,630
year was specifically to add tagging so

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:06,100
one of it has been in frameworks it

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:12,460
seems someone asked reasonably 5.51 so

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:16,450
the end of 2017 the effect is that some

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:19,750
content is not shown that's the default

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:23,710
state for K new stuff since 551 is that

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,100
certain content can be filtered out but

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:30,820
it also then allows us to do things like

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:33,700
in discover there is an experimental KN

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,000
SRC file which shows app images which

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,110
have been uploaded to the KD store which

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,170
are then filtered by

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,460
the file that filtered by file type make

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:50,320
sure there's only app images it's

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:54,850
filtered by architecture and is filtered

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,190
by bit level and then to make sure that

00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:01,750
only app images which will actually run

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:04,390
on your system get shown and it's the

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:09,820
reason that sort of stuff is built as

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:13,810
tags rather than information in the OCS

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:17,020
api itself is that it is too specific to

00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:20,560
a particular type of content and OCS is

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,630
supposed to be content type agnostic but

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,020
it allows us a lot of wide-ranging

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:29,020
possibilities like that so in the comic

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,290
book reader for example very like

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,870
specific things like you have a series

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,210
of comic books you might want to have

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,790
those in order they are separate items

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,090
on the store but you are then able to

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:45,340
say okay that is the previous one and if

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:49,510
you've got a diverging storyline you can

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,520
have those two items are the next so

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:58,300
that there's a lot of options in that so

00:22:51,520 --> 00:23:00,610
in short yes there are tags yeah a

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,190
problem that Forker mentioned during his

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,290
talk on frameworks on Android but also

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,610
something we occasionally run into in

00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:11,200
plasma is that in past kiddie frameworks

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:13,720
we suffer a lot from historical baggage

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,390
there where the view I tagged that we

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,670
were using at a time widgets is heavenly

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,460
intertwine with business logic in those

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,390
frameworks things like a qubit based que

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,870
message box

00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:29,020
popping up or things requiring qubit

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,810
pointers to pass in parent windows I'm

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,100
curious as you sort of rewrote the UI

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:38,380
layer for the new stuff wearing work how

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,410
does your approach now compare to that

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,570
are you avoiding those mistakes or are

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,510
we just swapping out widgets for click

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,810
there and I'm avoiding it entirely and

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,800
it is actually something I would like

00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,740
something

00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,890
more familiar with event loops than me

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,900
to have a look at that's the question

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:04,720
asked listener thing that I was talking

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:07,260
about earlier which is literally it is a

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,500
complete conceptual thing so you

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:14,470
instantiate any question and you give it

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,810
a title and a text you know the various

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,630
sort of embellishments of what a

00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:23,680
question is what type of answer you

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:28,630
would like from it and then you just

00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:32,700
tell that question to be asked it then

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:35,440
tells any listener to ask the question

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,650
in this case there is a widget listener

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,730
and there is a cue quick listener and it

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:46,120
will then show a visual version of that

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:52,030
question in whatever form is needed for

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:53,980
that particular visual type all right

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,460
suspicion it might also be useful for

00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:02,080
things like screen readers and so on to

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:06,430
be able to ask things or actually who's

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,940
he he's not in here Aditya Hey I'm

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:13,510
thinking Mycroft make use of that maybe

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:16,210
but yeah it's yeah it's it took a while

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:20,080
to work out how to do that and I also

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:26,080
had to abstract away from some bits of

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,940
Ko Ko because I couldn't depend on I

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,530
couldn't depend on certain things that

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:36,970
kyo depends on so yeah but similar sort

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:44,350
of things a really simple job it's jobs

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:46,810
as in cake or add-on jobs but which just

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:50,530
do basic downloading there's no magic in

00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,120
the way that Kyo does it so yeah there's

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,540
a couple of steps to get through to make

00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,530
sure that there is no widget requirement

00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:01,080
at all for okay new stuff core which

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,870
yours always ready yeah

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,350
works for discover which has been using

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:12,870
that for some time and discover could

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:17,120
not require it couldn't use cue widgets

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:19,770
at all because earlier versions of

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,070
plasma mobile wasn't able to handle it

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,480
something like that there's yeah there's

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,910
something that didn't work right and

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,270
then we needed to be able to not have

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,550
widgets

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,350
no it wasn't an ability it was a choice

00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:38,100
we would we didn't want widgets on the

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:40,530
phone that's the one yeah no it was like

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,610
totally technically technically possible

00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:47,550
but didn't want them so yeah yeah that

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:51,750
was yeah there are so short no budget

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:55,740
requirements in gainers of course any

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:58,590
other questions otherwise there was a

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,910
ten thousand line patch right yes it's

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,890
in theirs so that's only two hundred

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:11,550
lines per person here in yeah you can

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:13,560
tote that won't take long there is it so

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,480
take a good careful look we got a couple

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:28,200
of minutes before the next speaker is up

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:32,760
so oq quick yeah no yeah I know it uses

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,430
the qml presenter to there we go that

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,010
one yeah I don't think I don't think we

00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:43,020
should do a live review here that's not

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:46,790
gonna be let's actually it's a little

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,750
bit dark there you go bit easier to read

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,900
but in about five minutes

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,260
actually let's give you a hand first all

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,809
right

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,870
woo thank you

00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:56,870
