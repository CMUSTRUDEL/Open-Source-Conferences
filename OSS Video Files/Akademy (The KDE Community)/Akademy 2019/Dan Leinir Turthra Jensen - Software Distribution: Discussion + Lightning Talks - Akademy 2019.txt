Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Getting software to end users has always been an issue those who create the software have been worried about. A great many solutions have been proposed and attempted for this problem. In this panel the different approaches will be discussion and questions from the audience answered.

In the lightning talk round you will hear about the different approaches from the people involved.

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,780
right so this is a really short roundup

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,830
of the various ways in which we

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,859
distribute software in KDE and

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,900
Jonathan's gonna start as a KDE is now

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,779
all about the applications we make many

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,400
find applications we make many decent

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,619
applications and we make a few kind of

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,269
rubbish applications and we should care

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,910
about making sure that our applications

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,750
get to the users the users get a good

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,430
experience and the first thing we need

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,860
to do is actually tell the users what

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,780
applications we make so I spend some

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,329
time earlier working on some earlier

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,250
work done by Harold to actually get an

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,809
up to date websites listing all of the

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,510
applications and projects and there's

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,870
180 three of them and they're finally

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,780
listed on our website this feels like

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,219
make a important project that should

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,890
have been done yonks ago and for some

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,050
reason it hasn't been done and there's

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,760
still lots of work to be done what's on

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,970
my slides yes there's still lots of work

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,810
to be done for it so firstly people need

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,890
to pay attention to what's on here make

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,510
sure that the screenshots are up-to-date

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,880
and the icons are up-to-date and the

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,500
icons are completing the breeze icon

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,530
theme and this doesn't yet link to app

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,530
stores it links to app stream URLs which

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,939
is here's a generic ID for the program

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,590
but which distribution zypher use those

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,619
on which package managers use those I'm

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,540
not quite sure the URL specification

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,720
itself was kind of broken so we were

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,400
probably the first people to use it and

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,079
we had to get fixes into the

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,369
specification for it to be used which

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,829
are still working their way and to

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,049
discover our software manager so we now

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,350
have a shiny list of everything that we

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,270
actually make including a manually

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,290
maintained list of the unmaintained ones

00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,909
because we don't have a good way of

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,439
saying well this software is no longer

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,229
useful and it's no longer maintained so

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,079
it's time to say that's that's done with

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,569
but we don't have a good way to do that

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,819
in the in the categorization that

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,650
already exists for the programs because

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,750
of

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,319
obscure reasons with the translations

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,010
and whatnot so I also have to maintain a

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,690
list of of unmaintained applications

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,599
which feels like a definite clutch in

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,700
our process but given that the app

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,920
stream data you feel free to comment if

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,900
you if you have a comment

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,349
given that the app stream data that we

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,690
use to make this website then gets used

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,400
by the App Store's it means that you fix

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,260
it once there it gets fixed everywhere

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,060
here it is a gnome software manager

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,030
where they promote it shaken pre

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,160
recently a good choice in the title

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,459
should be called app stream gets around

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:58,129
I think yep so we're not very good at

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,099
telling projects why they should become

00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:03,709
KDE projects why they should join our

00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:07,610
community and get through that a slight

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,410
bureaucratic hurdles rather than rather

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,360
than just throw it on on github or

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,549
whatever and there's all these good

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,599
reasons but we're not terribly good at

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,209
providing those good reasons to the

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,730
different projects and then we get about

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,290
as far as here at the minute releasing

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,120
the software where we tend to dump a

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,280
tarball but we're not very good at doing

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,019
the post release stuff and making sure

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,750
it gets the users and making sure that

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:33,319
it updates yeah so you make guitar and

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,639
maybe you tell Albert to do it to take

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,650
care of releasing it or they release it

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,069
themselves and maybe you write a blog

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,630
and how do you actually gets the users

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,160
we as Katie community need to start

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,959
caring a lot more about making sure our

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,410
software gets the users in a useful way

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:53,470
so the most popular way for getting to

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:55,459
users will have luka talk to us okay I'm

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,440
covering this from a slightly different

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,590
perspective because many of you know

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,450
about software distributions I'm talking

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:07,040
about the fact that the traditional way

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:10,190
of providing software to the users it's

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,910
a little more than getting a table all

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:17,660
doing some fancy magic and getting out a

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:21,109
package which is a rpm Deb table or

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,000
whatever you want basically what do

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,099
integrators as integrators because of

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,360
distributions are integrators producer

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:29,210
of the projects like

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,300
li mo Li mocks unique was kind of

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,569
integrated as well it's made to assure

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,699
consistency and safety first system

00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,710
compatible licensing it sounds like easy

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:43,430
but especially with historical codebase

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,189
KDP me as a very prominent example that

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,379
it has problems interventions underlying

00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,629
system which means will yeah will this

00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,960
library work with your software or it

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,560
will break in unexpected ways and lastly

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,750
to make sure that the binary is exactly

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,819
the same given the same turbo this is a

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,300
method by Debian and other projects that

00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:09,830
this kind of thing recently there have

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:13,310
been some contrasts between upstream and

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:19,250
downstream over the way they right way

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,229
to do software how to distribute it did

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,169
you do this rom know you were out doing

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:29,110
this wrong and whatnot but it turns out

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:32,509
that anyone is actually making mistakes

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,969
all the time it's human and both

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,360
upstream and down strange this famous

00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:40,009
the famous SSH vulnerability in Debian

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,009
from about said more than 10 years ago

00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,080
that basically broke the security SH a

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:50,389
bad patch

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,370
this one is more recent is a mistakenly

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:57,979
Paley's for a famous double ended up

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:59,810
ending up in KDE on this of course i'm

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,339
not pointing fingers this the thing I

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,409
thought but I mean I'm personally

00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,789
involved in openSUSE so I'm not blame

00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,819
myself

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:12,830
upstream so example Kista has had for a

00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:14,870
number of months and helper for quixote

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,750
it was basically omnipotent we could do

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,129
anything to your system directories it

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,550
was not removed because it wasn't

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,610
working

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:26,539
luckily for its intended purpose but it

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,589
was a very fire to your system or this

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,020
one's actually a failure of both

00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,560
upstream and now streams there was a

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,330
local privilege escalation in cable spam

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,280
well the no are not is upstream and

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,169
not even the dumplings because they

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,539
shipped it without noticing it came up

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:47,789
when doing idea when packaging it in

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:51,090
openSUSE number of months ago okay I say

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:53,190
do not fight cooperate because no one

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,460
will have the perfect recipe to they

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,110
were softer which means even upstream

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,990
for those things can have different

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,300
opinions and still cooperate on this for

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,849
example there are a couple of examples

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,770
here I see that after him and after him

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:13,080
cooperate well this one is about a fury

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,509
years old when the neva driver was there

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,800
plasma would please and bought people

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,039
from the plasma team and from the

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,729
openSUSE acadia team actually had fixed

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:28,289
it this one is a very big implementing

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:30,900
here one minute okay and people that

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:35,159
actually contribute other code fixes

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,810
everywhere so not let's not forget the

00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,780
people that work downstream like myself

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,060
and many do packaging you see can

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,710
actually go upstream there are people

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,270
that were in the working distance got a

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,419
KDE developer account and then can

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,789
actually improve the software directly

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,620
and we are also testing with different

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,400
configuration that we can confirm that

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,349
well so they met the matter is let's

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,630
work together to improve software it's

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,830
not necessary means we have to agree

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:07,610
with everyone all the time at the time

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,610
right

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,949
who's next

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,949
[Music]

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,050
images are awesome you should all use it

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:52,649
that's it thank you well I mean it's

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:56,370
pretty easy one file one app everything

00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:59,610
in that single file and the whole point

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,730
is that it's simple it's simple to

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,550
obtain it's simple to maintain once that

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,690
there's the infrastructure to create app

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,690
images continuously

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:15,360
there are of course issues and there are

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,180
security issues that should be accounted

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,420
for not just with the format itself with

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:25,110
the software with the libraries and one

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,980
way to have a solution for it is to use

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:32,459
fire gel we had in nitrix which is doing

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:36,209
exhibition that me and my buddies over

00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,660
there developed we utilize fire jail to

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:43,529
do this and boxing there are some

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,470
notable images available already create

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,870
an kdenlive are notable examples of them

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,480
there are also non KD apps such as

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:57,060
LibreOffice there is

00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:00,810
there is dashes and there are many other

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,640
plain there is also an app image it

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,700
doesn't require installation because

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,430
it's just one file it's a securable you

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,410
just download it and add the permissions

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,490
for it and it's going to run

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,089
there's no runtime there's no store you

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,200
just download it and run it

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,580
additional desktop integration is

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,680
something that

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,800
the app image developers are working on

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,680
typically to just download a file but it

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,720
doesn't get integrated into the into the

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,529
desktop environment like you don't get a

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,720
an icon on the menus you don't get

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:41,490
something like those being serviced to

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:45,540
update the image so there are programs

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,209
like a PhD which which monitors the

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,850
director is what the app images are

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,500
stored there is a PMA launcher which

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,140
helps with integration with a desktop

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,959
environment and there's the newly app

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:03,600
image services which basically aims to

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:05,130
unify everything else another point with

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,149
the app images is that there is in a

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:12,149
central store basically a like the whole

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,760
gist of it is that you that you the

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,810
developer developed application you put

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,800
the Tarble and using continuous

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,740
integration such as Travis CI Caleb CI

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,550
you peel the app image and the user gets

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:36,170
it directly from you without any

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:36,170
intermediaries and no that's not mine

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:46,290
okay so coming to similar technology

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:52,310
like up image we have static first type

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:55,709
is a framework to make aprica' appear

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:59,160
for running just stop running and

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:03,630
distributing desktop applications on

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,510
Linux the applications unlike app image

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,820
they run in a sandbox its environment

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,000
which means they are isolated from your

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,000
system and which has security benefits

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,160
of course you cannot have complete

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,250
sandbox ink because the application will

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:24,089
have access to network or some other

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,890
stuff so we need to make holes or for

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:30,270
some other stuff we have portals to

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:33,240
access files outside the sandbox and the

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,140
idea of first peg is to make everything

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,020
as

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,110
easy as possible so which foot pegs you

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,080
can run run it everywhere and build it

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,950
everywhere first we get this concept of

00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,140
run times where the most common basic

00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:53,520
libraries are in the run time that's

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,560
just like the base package and you just

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,900
build applications on top of that I

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,780
didn't just some specific libraries

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:05,970
required for the specific application

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:08,400
and it's you can run it on almost every

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,290
distribution and same is goes for

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,630
building you don't need to install

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,660
anything on your distribution you just

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:19,680
install the runtime and SDK which has

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,930
all the right libraries and completers

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,510
and everything so the builds are

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,040
reproducible so if you build it managed

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,150
to build one flat pack on one

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,220
distribution it will build on every ad

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:38,000
read distribution where you have flat

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:42,870
pack and then we have fed back flat hub

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,740
which is the main repository of four

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:50,490
pegs it serves as a repository and build

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:55,850
service and it's managed by tech people

00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,850
and also I think by people from endless

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,060
it can be used so by everyone you can

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,620
simply add this repository every

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,840
distribution where you have web pack and

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,570
you can simply add your application

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,700
there and maintain it the first peg

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,220
manifests which are like the recipes for

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,920
building flat packs everything is hosted

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,110
on github so you have access to all the

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,540
fat pegs so of all the manifest you can

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,090
send pitches to all the applications you

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,810
can found there and maintain your

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:30,390
application there it's really easy and

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:33,450
you can use I helped to build it and

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:38,670
distribute your application it's also

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:40,890
pretty installed or on many I think some

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,650
distributions already have Fred help

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,920
enabled by default for example in Fedora

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,639
I think

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,800
and last time I counted there 36 KD

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,880
applications I don't think retail QR

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
conversation

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,850
and besides KD applications they are

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:03,190
like Spotify steam telegrams of the most

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:06,760
common ones and go bit into details so

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:11,110
the format that Pegasus OS 3 which is

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,660
like get four distributions so it has

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:18,910
already benefits of get or you can go

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:21,310
back to previous versions you when you

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,130
like updating you just download the

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,690
thief so you don't always have to

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,980
downloadable application again again for

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:34,360
new update you can also host your

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,880
repositories it's so because like it you

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,550
can do just so builder application you

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,209
can upload it everywhere and anyone can

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:47,199
use it as okay

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:50,170
so the duty for more information

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,240
everyone we have both on Thursday in the

00:15:50,170 --> 00:16:03,699
morning so we we want to discuss more

00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:05,680
flat pick hello Igor from canonical

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,360
thank you for coming to the session I

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,060
want to talk to you about snaps and snap

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,220
crafts lovely image what we have is

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,410
self-contained applications that can run

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,750
on Linux distributions that support

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,430
snaps we have three musketeers we have

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,959
the snap D service which enables the

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,300
functionality we have the snap

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,820
user-space component so they can install

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,560
and run your applications and then we

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,149
have the snap store where all the

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,699
applications are hosted and originated

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,410
from and finally we have snap crafts the

00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:36,579
command line tool to actually build

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:38,680
applications so snap crafts is pretty

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,810
and if they think we use files in a

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,930
llamo format so if you know llamo we can

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,760
start building your applications to be

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,930
distributable as snaps then we have

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,880
backends that are based on virtual

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,250
machines or containers you can use both

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,990
depending on your setup you can do local

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,670
builds you can do remote builds in our

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,899
in our system if you don't have

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,910
resources and build for other

00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,600
architectures in total six architectures

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,490
you

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,430
also use an interactive build system

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,650
that we have available online then once

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,549
you have built your applications you

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,799
push them to the store the store is web

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:14,020
front-end is discoverable by millions of

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,240
users and not just to go into folks

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,610
although we support to go into from 1404

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,400
onwards we also support 41 other

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,929
distributions so if you have a jar o if

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,880
you have fedora if you have sent to us

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,730
Debian you're also welcome to use

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,720
applications and also afters welcome to

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,159
the store so once you have published

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,570
your application

00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,880
there's the maintenance part which is

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,429
not negligible and there is an element

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,400
of updates and element of reliability

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:44,740
for the end users so you have two

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,120
sectional automatic updates if there is

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,690
a fail failure there's gonna be a

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,159
rollback

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,890
which means that you retain the

00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:53,350
functionality and you do not disrupt

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,270
your user sessions you can also do

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,460
parallel installs so you can test your

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,320
application as developers or as users

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,539
you can have multiple versions in at the

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,100
same time running in parallel for

00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,780
instance you can install two instances

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,770
of ocular and there'll be completely

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,870
separate applications once you have your

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,059
users you can track metrics you can

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,950
track your usage by version by

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,110
distribution so you can actually see how

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,090
your application is trending correlated

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,429
to your social media activities or other

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:25,390
ways how you promote applications by the

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:27,309
way we can help you with that as well 94

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,990
kfk shion's at the store and Counting

00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,179
working close early with jonathan here

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,159
then working closely with other members

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,320
of the kt community we have a build snap

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,700
which simplifies the build process we

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,490
have plug-ins for many programming

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,620
languages we have C make we have all

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,419
sorts we'll talk about it a little more

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,610
we have contents nets so once you

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,679
distribute a KD application you don't

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,390
get the whole bunch of megabytes it's

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,309
all contained in one elegant snap and

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,260
your application is just a delta on top

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,570
of that very elegant for streamlined

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,700
distributions how much sorry one minute

00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,860
no problem there's also an experimental

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,780
plasma desktop so you can actually try

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,299
that as a snap and there's a KD

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,190
extension that's in the pipeline so that

00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:08,919
everything I've mentioned will be even

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,570
simpler here's a visual representation

00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,840
of what it looks like when you use the

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,539
content snap basically you

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,429
Barrett and Ikeda guys have done all the

00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,549
magic for you so you streamline and save

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:23,039
time as I mentioned Cadia extension

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:25,169
that's coming tomorrow there's a buff

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,150
will be doing social distribution how

00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,320
you build snaps you welcome to join the

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:35,370
session thank you for your time

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,510
next slide and so when we launch kdeeny

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,500
on we looked at how kiddie software was

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,330
component distributed and we thought

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,830
well we can bring modern techniques to

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,570
it the continuous integration the

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,159
continuous development continuous

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,340
Quality Assurance the continuous

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,169
deployment and do it for not just the

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,059
stable stuff but also directly from get

00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:57,270
so that it can be used as a developer

00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,909
tool and a testing tool I think there's

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,549
my own decided yep so so we have it

00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:06,539
build from tards we build from git and

00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:09,870
it's available as apps packages and and

00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,309
there's docker images and we also build

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,470
the snap packages now now building the

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,029
snack packages in neon it's done because

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,039
it's convenient and the infrastructure

00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,110
was there but it should be done more

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,020
integrated into the applications rather

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,990
than in a separate standalone Kadi

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,190
project but we were definitely keen to

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:35,370
bring application development and

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:38,760
deployment directly into KDE so yeah

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:41,460
craf is a kind of a picture manager for

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,059
Windows and Mac it originals from km

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,770
windows it was mainly sauce based so you

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:49,860
had to compare everything from sauce

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:53,480
since a few years we got binary packages

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,990
that are basically a cache so you run

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,620
Kate and you get a Kate set up within a

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,210
few minutes

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,750
even with not the fastest

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:07,740
interconnection we support Windows Mac

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:12,419
and yeah that's the way how to get this

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:15,990
get stuff on Windows Mac to have with

00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:19,830
that we also have the binary factory

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,929
which is basically Sai 490 builds for

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,200
those platforms in the beginning it was

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,350
only Windows now we got also Mac and all

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,559
the other platforms like

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,539
pack and Raiders also hosted their say

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,210
Four Winds mech point you can point

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:37,360
users there to get their installer for

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,150
those platforms not everything stable

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,780
and even if you asked us to put the

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,340
software on this page you not support it

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,320
on this platform that means you get an

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,419
installer but you're supposed to test

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,450
yourself for yourself and say yeah it's

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:59,470
working and if it's a upload somewhere

00:21:52,450 --> 00:22:03,400
else and tells you to users on Windows

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,340
you usually have an installer which is

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,549
in binary that just copies files and

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,100
some locations that the old way how we

00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:14,140
distribute software we are currently

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,970
working on getting software into the

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,190
store ok stash is currently the only

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:22,120
application there but we are working on

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,130
getting firstly updates 4k staffs and of

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,890
course we try to get Kate and other

00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:35,289
application to the store because that's

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:38,950
more convenient to retailers and for Mac

00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:42,940
we don't have support for the store yet

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:46,630
we can create dmg images say they aren't

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,390
sciency there's room for improvement but

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,320
users can install them and run them

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,990
locally and it should work as same as

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,140
within days please test your application

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,360
before you promote it as working and

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,820
down directly link to binary factory and

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:09,100
those are rolling releases or just

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:12,010
nightly that I'm stable inks for a store

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,990
that's a different topic we need to find

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,690
solution there so that's not only code

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,630
signing but I'll say you're not allowed

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:27,159
to use all API sweet deals currently say

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:28,270
I could get hot I just wanted to include

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,530
everything in here because there are

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,270
many different distribution channels

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,309
that are users these days will expect us

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,590
to use and if we don't then the users

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,870
will not care about us and so steam is

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,690
very proper distribution channel for

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:43,379
games and graphic stuff

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,809
and we use it for critter and shakin

00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:47,850
please no and so so we only have one up

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,470
there and yet here's a great way to

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,110
drupes our software though we're not

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,919
making use of and that seems a shame

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,570
incidentally creature has been on there

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,519
for quite a while and it's going very

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,500
well it's by their biggest income

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,809
sources and and could have a business

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,789
model around this as well which is great

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,590
similarly for a google play there's a

00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:07,080
very popular app store very popular way

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,490
for software to get distributed and we

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,399
have k-stars and we do have a shakin

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,190
pre-ride and not much else there kitty

00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,899
connect of course but again there's a

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,049
pub the way people get software and we

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:21,049
should make sure that we use it F droid

00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:23,870
another way for people to get software

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:27,210
it's more aligned with our ethos and

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:29,220
community spirit and freedom and yet we

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,059
only have one app there rather than all

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,639
of our apps and again the Apple app

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:37,740
stores as Hannah said is not much used

00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:38,850
but allegedly critter is on there it's

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,960
hard even to know what's on there

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,960
because you can't press this on the web

00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:48,120
right I'm going to try and run through

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,039
again hot new stuff in about two minutes

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,019
it used to be owned by a company called

00:24:50,039 --> 00:25:00,330
high Bo one and was very recently sold

00:24:54,019 --> 00:25:03,840
to a separate entity to the KDE a be but

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,700
it is legally bound to the TV which

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,419
means that Katy now has complete control

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:12,419
over the KDE store there is this the

00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,950
only reason it cannot be moved over is

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:20,029
something which aligns perfectly with

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:22,620
our goal of privacy we there is a strong

00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:24,000
personal data protection legislation in

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,429
Germany which means that that data

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,580
cannot go to the evey it has to be kept

00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:33,649
at that separate entity get hot new

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:38,419
stuff itself is a freedesktop.org

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:43,860
specification which is an xml-based

00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:47,070
specification for content delivery and

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,869
review and everything surrounding that

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,889
sort of thing it is entirely content

00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:53,580
type agnostic you've all run into it

00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,650
where there

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,830
there's a little star on a button and it

00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:05,010
says get something that's get hot new

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:10,350
stuff anyone can upload new content to

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:12,540
the store it is currently it has now

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,600
been put under the same umbrella it's

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,470
now all stored or Katie dog but there

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,180
used to be some 130 odd websites they

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:28,310
still all exist but they now will point

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:32,070
to their store it's also used to be

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:35,280
basically just controlled by a small

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:38,550
nondescript set of people who happen to

00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,760
look at it and be able to remove stuff

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,700
from the store there is now a socially

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,270
involved process by which people can you

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:52,610
know ask for things to be marked as

00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:55,950
wrong or yeah there's a proper feedback

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:58,140
system for it now we have a revenue

00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,910
sharing system which is a strange thing

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,530
for something which isn't a technically

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,150
a store there is no way of actually

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:07,770
buying stuff on there but any one in

00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,460
here who has uploaded stuff to the store

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:15,290
will have noticed a bit on the site that

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:18,270
says flings which is a way of measuring

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,950
how many downloads you've had over the

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:24,300
course of the previous month

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,890
and then you get a share of the revenue

00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,060
that the store has brought in via

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,330
advertising if you want to know more I

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:42,510
have a chat in about an hour and a half

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:45,240
over there and yeah so the more directly

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:48,180
related item in this talk would be

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,250
discover and discover is our own

00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,900
application and add-on manager it is

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,940
installed anywhere that you have a

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,100
plasma desktop which means it's on

00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,690
openSUSE we've discovered recently that

00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:05,400
it is also on the if you install the

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:07,340
plasma desktop meta tag on Debian you

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,140
also have it it's on net runner

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:14,770
and Kubuntu and a bunch of other places

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:19,160
as well and obviously it's the primary

00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:21,680
software center on KDE on it has support

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,000
for consuming all of the things that all

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,790
of the people here have just talked

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,460
about including the one that I just

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:31,670
talked about as well it is a central

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,680
place for handling all of your con all

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:38,750
of your applications and your add-ons it

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,880
is not a package manager but that's

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,860
something we can go into a bit more but

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,720
it is what users will expect it to be

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,730
these days which is displays

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,470
applications and all their other add-ons

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,010
and all the other goodies that users

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,010
will care a bit

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:59,660
so when we use these channels to ship

00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,880
our stuff to our users we need to care

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,890
about it after we've done the tarball

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,540
you need to care about it and take on

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,330
the new responsibilities so that

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:11,720
includes security announcers making sure

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,730
the software is updated but also there's

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,810
there's money that can be involved and

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,210
we have to make the choice for

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:19,220
applications whether or not we want to

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,430
we want to monetize them in some way or

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,540
other and at the moment the the KDE

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,680
doesn't have very good structures or

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,810
didn't have any structures for

00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,480
supporting that jaqen pre does monetize

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:32,330
their app but he has to do it all

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,470
himself right and and we need to find a

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,560
way within KDE

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,000
that applications can can decide in an

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,290
open and transparent way

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,470
in what way they're going to monetize

00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,970
your app and who's gonna then decide

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,260
what to do with money and when and

00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,340
that's something we should embrace and

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,540
we shouldn't be scared of it we should

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,730
embrace it

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,850
and do it in an open way that works for

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:58,280
the best works for the best for our

00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:00,590
application maintainer and then we can't

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,720
even decide which way to name the kiddie

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,390
applications bundle and this is an

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,160
example of this sort of problem where

00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,900
where it's a relatively trivial matter

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,780
but because we don't have a process for

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,160
deciding how to how to solve it then it

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,290
just gets stuck and we end up with a

00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,700
case where well we have a website that

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,560
lists all the kiddie applications but we

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,500
also release the kiddie applications

00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,510
thing and the name is duplicated and

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,960
it feels bit confusing but there's no

00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:29,090
process within kiddie for solving that

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,559
and as I said earlier there's no process

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,669
for marking stuff as unmaintained and

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,669
we've got to make sure we remove the

00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,409
stuff when it no longer becomes useful

00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:49,549
so we have a panel now how does this

00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:53,059
work one minute to spare microphone

00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:54,559
Croesus also if you would like to think

00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,590
about some questions awesome

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,169
Leo talked about the Italian catalog

00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,639
we're not there either

00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:04,669
that is very true we are not on that

00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:06,289
catalog there are 0kt apps there we

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,850
could have a hundred percent of Katy

00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:12,350
apps there yeah as far as I understand

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,059
Jonathan riddle here has just spent some

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,850
time in Westminster talking to

00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:19,279
government to people was that's

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,960
something that unfortunately the UK

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,779
government has more important issues on

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:30,260
its mind than free software which is a

00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:31,970
shame certainly needs to as a as a ethos

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,340
and there's a lot of work to get that

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,019
into the sphere of government we need to

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,320
take every opportunity we can to get it

00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:41,000
into the sphere of government including

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,440
issues like well how do I should get or

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,470
install the software well now we have

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,659
answers for how do you get our software

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,370
and why you should use it and and who

00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:51,080
are KDE and we should be able to embrace

00:31:49,370 --> 00:32:01,700
government when whenever we have the

00:31:51,080 --> 00:32:06,200
possibility so this is about the social

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,510
social responses like user content on

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,750
the on the apps themselves they have

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,940
generic policy on whether or not you

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,919
retain the right to reuse this content

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:21,110
because as you said there were 150

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,820
websites previously obviously the reuse

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,799
of that content potentially inside other

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,230
applications that honor context may not

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,200
be arranged very well or it may be and

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,480
that is yeah very very good question

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,030
yeah it's not very clear in a lot of

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,620
ways but every piece of content

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:44,150
on the KDE store has an explicit license

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:46,040
and it is suggested that that license

00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:49,190
should be a free software license of

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:52,040
some description there is an entry for

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:55,300
proprietary but as far as I'm aware very

00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,620
very few entries have chosen that one

00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,020
which means that there is things like

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,590
it's usually a Creative Commons license

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:06,610
if it is content which then is the reuse

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,200
of the content is then that explicitly

00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:11,560
stated in which particular version of

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,850
the Creative Commons license you picked

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,410
then there's the various ppl type

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:24,620
licenses as well so yeah it's explicitly

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:26,420
stated for each piece of content not

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,850
sure if I'm going off-topic from your

00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,340
question but I interpreted it as and how

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,560
did who decides what gets to be on which

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,840
distribution channel and we decided on

00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,600
the rights over it and for Chitty neon

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,450
that's easy we ship anything within KDE

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,980
and so that decision gets taken by the

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,120
Katie community and those processors

00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,850
sometimes come in at slow and

00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,290
bureaucratic the incubator it's easy to

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,180
get stuck there a kiddie review it's

00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:53,630
easy to get stuck there as I say it's

00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:57,590
hard surprisingly hard to get it listed

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:59,930
as unmaintained but so we could do with

00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,270
making that a lot smoother yes so how do

00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:07,630
you get who decides what gets on the

00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:07,630
in-app store and and who looks after it

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,120
well I guess it's up to the developer to

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,649
decide what's the easiest way for them

00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,419
to distribute their software after all

00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:22,240
is their product is their users and I

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:25,550
wouldn't say that this needs to be

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,409
anything else then the convenience and

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,630
loyalty to your users so whatever you

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,899
find most convenient that should be a

00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,550
choice and base it on the most critical

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,159
factors that you have for your software

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,169
is its retention its durability of the

00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,060
software is it how difficult it is for

00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:43,850
you to package and distribute is the

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,909
social elements so this may be a

00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,380
roundabout answer but I wouldn't say

00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:50,390
that you go for

00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,860
specific store because of the store you

00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,530
go because you have needs and then you

00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,930
find the product that suits your

00:34:53,530 --> 00:35:05,800
requirements the best phenomena bones to

00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:09,190
add to that okay

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,420
just as I could get in in what at least

00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,310
disclaimer I'm talking about my personal

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,090
experience I don't know how it goes with

00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:18,410
other distributions like Debian Ubuntu

00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:22,390
our clinics whatever I know about

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:28,340
openSUSE basically anyone can actually

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:30,500
submit anything to as a contribution it

00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,530
goes to a review basically with the

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:36,410
people that actually do most of the work

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:39,860
at this time me and a few others but

00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,870
there's not prejudicial the only vetting

00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,480
have vetting is actually that the

00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:47,960
problem your soft one is to play well we

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,880
did the rest which means most of the

00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,510
time it builds it builds with the

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,120
distribution okay let's go there are the

00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,470
only special cases sell for licensing

00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,430
for new packages you have to make sure

00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:03,140
it's compatible and in cases sometimes

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,500
there are changes for example in the

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:09,410
bill Flags recently we had link time

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,570
optimization added and it broke came in

00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,220
came a money there was an error but only

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:17,660
that option actually made it show up but

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,240
basically the process is not free for

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,520
all but basically anyone can go sign up

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,620
a get an account and actually contribute

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,990
to the trend distribution I don't know

00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:32,840
about the others but this how I work for

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:34,880
keyd is often openSUSE I'm not sure

00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,950
about flat hub whether there are some

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,680
restrictions about the software which

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:43,190
can go there because there's also some

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,770
proprietary stuff like Nvidia drivers so

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:50,930
I guess almost everything go there I

00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,090
haven't seen any restriction so far fed

00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:56,750
up or anything any submission which

00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,010
would be rejected so just the

00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,790
application needs to follow some

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:05,000
guidelines so like

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:08,300
they're so like up steam Oh metadata has

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,910
to be like valid and the application

00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,210
needs to match the obscene metadata and

00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:22,250
so on but not sure about any other

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:25,880
addictions any so so I'm distributing my

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:28,760
K gap which is the the the the the KDE

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,280
version of the gap app the which is

00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,609
infamous I'm not actually doing it but

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,320
would that be a problem with anybody and

00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,510
is there any mechanism that you can can

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,510
do to maybe intervene and say this is

00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:45,980
not aligned with our social or political

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,500
ecosystem or or or what does not be a

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,810
problem it's an easy answer for the KDE

00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,690
store the gap app is not compatible with

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,670
the coz if that one is very

00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,970
straightforward I don't know about

00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,670
anybody else I don't know the details

00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:04,820
but is it part of KDE and if it is and

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:08,450
put it in neon it's like a massive

00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:12,200
instance but then for the Nazi US Nazi

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:14,570
community so if anti-gay anti immigrant

00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,109
nd anything so it's it's a branded

00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:20,090
version of a hate speech Oh interesting

00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:22,700
ethics so what it would it what if the

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:26,510
app includes or point people towards

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:29,240
hate speech particularly as I say in the

00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,670
case of Katie neon it's up to it's up to

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,290
the Katie community on the whole and I

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,390
don't think we've ever had that sort of

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,170
issue but if we would we would surely

00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,190
have a good long discussion about it

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,040
likewise that I have not encountered

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,619
situations like that that would be a

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,140
very deliberate discussion to understand

00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:49,910
exactly the impact and make the right

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,520
decision but again this is beyond

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:56,680
software this is a possibly even

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,680
political question so I don't

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,460
in the past there have been warned

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,950
lookup sites and stuff like that that

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,500
for a while we're in Debian but they

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:14,170
never made it into a bun - and I know

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:25,090
that Kubuntu we decided no we don't want

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:26,860
that in case of the distribution of this

00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,050
kind of things usually a handle

00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,840
distribution why the the usually there

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:34,990
are policies that define how things are

00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,930
kept and behavior and whatnot Poisson

00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:42,010
distribution basically everything needs

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:44,340
to stand up to the Community Guidelines

00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,780
basically if there is a problem as

00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,210
basically tosses like John mentioned for

00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,280
you if there is a problem let's talk

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,490
about it and see what actually can be

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,710
done to fix it this basically shorts it

00:39:54,490 --> 00:40:00,070
doesn't evolve it goes be as I said it

00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,560
goes beyond KDE and the software might

00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,760
be for the distribution goes the the

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:10,450
whole community behind the distribution

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:13,660
and furthermore even more than that if I

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:18,160
remember right the gap people closed

00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:20,740
source some of mastodons infrastructure

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:40,360
so I think you'll be able to kick them

00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:42,370
out on that the clients yeah I know so I

00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,380
have a small feedback about you know a

00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,570
spreading word and marketing the Katy so

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,450
what happens at least in Indian colleges

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,880
is that people want something so let's

00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,440
suppose that they want to download you

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,150
know they want to check a software which

00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:01,510
don't store in file so they know don't

00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:03,100
know if ok so so so they don't know if k

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,020
torrent exists and similar is the case

00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,050
with other applications also and at the

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,840
same thing like you know when never

00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,520
if someone asked their what to install

00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,290
as I could destroy everyone says okay

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,880
install will do with no minutes good

00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,040
it's simple and it's a beginner friendly

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,600
but I've never heard anyone say you know

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,250
like installed kdeeny on or installed

00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,220
plasm it's quite good so you know like

00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,810
as a feedback it would be quite good if

00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,550
you know like KD applications and a

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:30,600
distress a whole you know like can be

00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:34,850
how more marketed and promoted so it

00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,850
reads lunar Asian like a wider audience

00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,640
yeah I don't think anybody in particular

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,910
disagrees that we need to do more and

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,780
more sort of specific marketing on on

00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,970
particular applications and the basic

00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:05,040
the basic quality of our software in

00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:07,620
general because you know being as this

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,110
is a software community that originated

00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:14,280
in Germany amongst engineers everybody

00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:16,650
is really happy to talk about the

00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,120
negative points of a software and these

00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,520
are the things that we need to fix and

00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,170
this is yeah we need to you know we

00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,430
don't want to release something which

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:29,550
isn't perfect and that is true but at

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:31,740
the same time we also have some software

00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:35,130
which is frankly awesome

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,930
now most people in here not aware of

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:42,510
this but I do not use that word more

00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:44,310
than like five times a year and yeah we

00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:48,270
have some really amazing software and

00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:50,580
it's yeah we need to talk about that

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:53,840
more it that would be that would be good

00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:57,050
and all of these various distribution

00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:01,590
methods all of these various types of

00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:03,300
ways of getting a software helps all of

00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:07,320
every single one of them right helps

00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:13,220
with that in you know in different ways

00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:15,990
as well yeah yeah absolutely

00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,960
also I know that the promo team is

00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,980
hiring

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:24,010
and not like money but ya know like I

00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,589
give ya like you know if you have like

00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,270
if you have specific ideas for oh I by

00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:30,609
the way there is an app that just had

00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,619
any release and I didn't you know you

00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:36,849
didn't really get any marketing or yeah

00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:42,130
it's totally a thing the promo team has

00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:45,730
a calendar for release announcement and

00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:49,510
just general promo work and if you come

00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:53,890
to the promo team with a an app in need

00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:56,619
of some help marketing they will find a

00:43:53,890 --> 00:44:01,000
spot in my calendar for you and it will

00:43:56,619 --> 00:44:09,310
it'll be made to happen the best

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:10,570
calendar absolutely we have on the so

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,910
one of the issues that we had recently

00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:16,690
was with the kitty applications bundle

00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:18,609
was working out should the ant release

00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,140
announcement for that point directly to

00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:22,900
the snap store in the flat-pack store

00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,640
and we had some very long discussions to

00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,380
that and to me is a no-brainer of course

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,950
we should point to places where people

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,210
can get our software and we had long

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,740
discussions with her because it wasn't

00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,810
not everything was included in every

00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,520
store and there wasn't a single page

00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:39,070
that was necessarily up to date that

00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:42,400
could be pointed at so I would say to

00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:45,130
the store people get a get a publisher

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,440
page which I've said lots to everyone

00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,880
but they it feels like a no-brainer that

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,690
you should be able to go over all the

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,119
Katy applications here and for the

00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,290
Android store and the other ones again

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,599
it's part of the problem that because

00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:00,369
Katie doesn't support applications being

00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,750
monetized and being put on the more

00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:04,780
commercial minded stores that Windows

00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,700
one Mac that they're not all done under

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,500
one account and so you can't easily

00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,930
search for what sort of stuff from KDE

00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,770
and so in our announcements we also

00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:16,390
can't we also can't have a simple link

00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,859
saying if you use the store then here's

00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:20,950
a great way to get some of our software

00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:22,570
and that's another reason why our

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,839
structures and processes should be

00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:27,280
improved to allow projects to be able to

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,960
use those doors in the way that suits

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,030
them when they want to monetize it or

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,640
otherwise

00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:38,820
and had another point I remember what it

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:41,220
is have a question well I have an idea

00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,730
we have a distributions list that isn't

00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,880
used very much because right now it's

00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:51,330
mostly overlapped by the packagers list

00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:58,890
which is for distros and packaging

00:45:51,330 --> 00:46:01,680
issues with KT right but I think we

00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:03,960
should say we should widen the scope of

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,240
the distributions list to make it about

00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,300
distributing the software to everybody

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:19,470
and talk more about how we can make sure

00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:23,070
that every single application is you

00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:26,750
know for flat-pack for a pitchfork snaps

00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:30,390
for you know the Italian catalogue

00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:32,760
everywhere and kept people talking about

00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:34,560
it in that list that's about that stuff

00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,210
it's not necessary I mean part of it

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,970
what you're talking about is a community

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:41,790
issue as in monetizing and where the

00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:45,540
money goes but to me that's pretty easy

00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:48,810
because it starts out tiny and and it

00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,190
could just be bringing someone to

00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,500
Academy that otherwise we couldn't

00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:56,700
afford to bring to academy or having one

00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:04,110
more sprint it's not like we're selling

00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:05,970
ourselves to the devil or something yeah

00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:08,910
so the distributions list was once upon

00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:13,250
a time for it was intended to be an

00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:16,680
extremely low traffic mailing lists for

00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:20,310
issues that all distributions would want

00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:24,230
to pay attention to I'm thinking that

00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:28,260
that's is now covered by the security

00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:30,750
list pretty much all of those issues are

00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,850
done there that are not covered by the

00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,730
packages list so the distribution list

00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:38,100
could be open up to becoming something

00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:43,580
while effectively more useful I guess

00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,580
more well defined as well so

00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,790
do question the first is would it be

00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,410
possible to sort of create a magnet link

00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,240
that includes all of your stores so that

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,190
when somebody clicks on the link says

00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,410
well whatever package manager I have on

00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,360
my system and then just have a single

00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:00,630
unified LinkedIn then be able to process

00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,310
it or is that beyond the collaboration

00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,590
are you willing to have and and the

00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:07,560
second is and this is for the snap

00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:12,050
flatback and an app image once is it

00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:15,300
possible to use some sort of an upstream

00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,490
notification of just like get the hot

00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,990
new stuff kind of this is a new there's

00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:22,280
a new version of this one don't use this

00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:25,130
dis first anymore because it's unsafe

00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,560
is-is-is is that kind of data flow

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:30,810
arranged amongst all of you the first

00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,060
question I touch on the second one

00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:35,460
because I don't honestly know but the

00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:40,250
first question sounds like something

00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:44,130
which would be covered by there is now a

00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:46,440
URL handler in KDE called the apps

00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:50,850
called app stream right so if you give

00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:53,490
it the app stream name of an application

00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,590
it will in most cases it will launch

00:48:53,490 --> 00:49:00,180
discover and show you that page and then

00:48:55,590 --> 00:49:05,280
give you whatever version is available

00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:09,750
in your priority list I am thinking it

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,730
doesn't work on mine I've broken

00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:17,720
discover on my local installed is I'm

00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:20,280
working on it you can try it might work

00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:24,870
it'll be on that screen anyway you can't

00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,340
see it share basically shared the

00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:31,260
downloads I don't know how much

00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:37,800
bandwidth or is but that that's more of

00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:39,750
a that's the second question so with

00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,760
snaps you get automatic updates so if

00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,830
the developer has published an update to

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,810
their software you will receive that

00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:49,140
update automatically so you do not need

00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:50,520
to worry about that aspect however if

00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,130
the developer has not published an

00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,610
update to their application there is a

00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:58,370
problem but that

00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:00,620
whether developers are committed to

00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,670
maintaining and updating their software

00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,800
especially when there are security

00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:07,690
patches if that element is covered

00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,690
you're covered too transparently with

00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,910
Peckinpah dub this situation is

00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,270
basically the same just what is

00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:19,700
unfortunate that many many applications

00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:22,610
in flat hop currently are not maintained

00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:25,370
but by directional developers so which

00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:28,730
like most like in distribution server

00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:29,900
packages maintain applications on behalf

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,960
some someone else

00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:36,740
so in Adelbert the application would be

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,660
maintained by actual developers who like

00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:41,840
know though whether there's something

00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:44,270
broken or something like that so that's

00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,730
something we will need to improve in

00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:48,950
future we will need to get like the

00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:54,350
actual developer to care about the

00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:57,500
packages in snyder and find out but the

00:50:54,350 --> 00:51:00,260
current situation is that it's mostly up

00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:04,610
to the package or if you know so it is

00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:09,050
the same if you publish the an update it

00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:11,350
automatically goes to the user and if

00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:14,000
there is a problem with with that update

00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:17,480
basically the only thing the user can do

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:23,020
to report an issue on github but that's

00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,020
it or just revert update but

00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,010
[Music]

00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,060
was well what was the first question

00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:47,080
again say I think well the best thing

00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:52,690
they forgot oh yes yes

00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:56,190
basically yes yes any same distribution

00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:59,500
I don't think mine is Shana but maybe

00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:03,010
should person I don't he'll discover but

00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:05,530
I know people who do it should actually

00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:08,710
work I mean at least I've been trying to

00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,870
do this in Kaelyn a couple of days ago

00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,870
and in my session and it offered me to

00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:16,720
install packages to discover just by

00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:19,960
tapping the name so I think it works if

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,760
there's your system is all configured it

00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:27,760
should work also for even if you don't

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:30,370
have any access to the app stores and

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,270
this is the live demo for the kitty

00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:37,030
applications website and if you click on

00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:40,090
the install button on the applications

00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:44,020
page it takes you to an app stream URL

00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:47,530
just to show how pioneering this is I

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,530
guess within the concepts of learn from

00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:52,750
the desktop stuff the the specification

00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:56,050
was incomplete and mixed on URL in your

00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:59,320
eye and it doesn't necessarily work and

00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:02,670
as it probably doesn't work on this

00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:06,250
computer so we need to make sure that

00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:08,250
hold our hold our distributions and and

00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:11,590
app stores to account to make sure that

00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,820
these antrum your eyes are integrated in

00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:14,110
such a way that they all work for all

00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,530
the different applications and that

00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:23,230
means automated QA to do that and that's

00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,770
a task that needs to be done any more

00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,830
questions

00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:29,080
[Music]

00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:32,380
so I also had one question so what are

00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,180
your thoughts about like labeling some

00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,940
of the software's on KDE application

00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,470
piece as for example different standards

00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,420
gold standard silver standard bronze

00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:42,490
standard so these are the applications

00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,760
that are stable supported we work

00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:48,000
everywhere what's your thought on that

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,800
so like these are the applique

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,380
that will always have like security

00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:57,210
updates ready for them when I put

00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,910
together the applications webpage I did

00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:01,680
have to work out well which what is the

00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:05,760
definitive list of our applications and

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,290
it's not a simple answer and did have to

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,330
work out which ones are maintained but

00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,770
also some of them we have some

00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,030
applications which are listed on the

00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,970
applications page which don't actually

00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:16,230
have a release yet and so I would agree

00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,870
they shouldn't be on there until this

00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:23,100
release because it's not necessary to

00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:26,400
have a useful to users and our processes

00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,600
are not great for doing that when we are

00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,000
aware that stuff doesn't get updated

00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,730
well the beauty of KDE is that we are a

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,500
community and once you get into it then

00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,210
everyone has access to everything and so

00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:41,960
we can Co maintain it and so the beauty

00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:45,420
of that that process is that right

00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,770
anyone can and does help fix stuff when

00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,180
it's needed and if nobody's doing that

00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,720
then that means it should be marked

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,720
unmaintained

00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:03,339
well from our perspective if the snap is

00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,859
in the store it should work on all the

00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:07,390
supported distributions the 41 whether

00:55:05,859 --> 00:55:10,570
the application is actually of high

00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:13,510
quality and the functional logic of it

00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:15,250
is silver bronze or gold that's up to

00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,720
the developer I mean if you put an

00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,970
application that does nothing it will

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:25,990
work beautifully everywhere is it useful

00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:27,430
probably not personally aside that I

00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,440
really don't agree with tiring

00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,240
applications because it also depends on

00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,820
the users okay I'll make a controversial

00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:37,060
statement here Pima most of people hate

00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:39,030
it I love it so and it depends on the

00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,990
users also depending on maintain

00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:43,180
application being unmaintained as

00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,160
Jonathan mentioned actually we have a

00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,589
lot of application that actually work

00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,750
well but they're not really actually

00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:51,520
maintained and since they get a constant

00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,650
developer flow think of the games they

00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,119
work basically almost on their own

00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,609
perhaps they have a few bucks here and

00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:01,000
there but basically did not get a lot of

00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:03,460
developer attention but still they could

00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,599
be classified as working so I think it's

00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:10,960
quite too subjective to do this in for

00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,430
the forethought tiring and personally

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:25,330
I'm glad the distributions don't do that

00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:28,510
don't do that yeah a one example of that

00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:31,660
would be that the current version of a

00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:35,170
Maroc would be marked as unmaintained it

00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,790
is based on cube for basically there is

00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,750
no distribution left in the world that

00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:43,380
still ships it

00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:46,950
they changed on openSUSE last week yeah

00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:52,930
well yeah on tumbleweed it got removed

00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:56,109
and yeah it's it's but the problem there

00:56:52,930 --> 00:57:01,359
being there is a version of Amarok which

00:56:56,109 --> 00:57:03,490
is in development for q5 which then is

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,520
available on some distributions and some

00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:08,270
distributions it became installed in

00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,610
place of the cute

00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:15,860
four versions others it simply removed

00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:20,560
Amarok and all in all a degraded user

00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:26,450
experience but if you go with a

00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:27,560
unmaintained gold bronze style listing

00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,360
of the applications

00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:33,380
Amarok would just be listed as

00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:37,760
unmaintained when the situation is that

00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:40,700
it is effectively maintained it still

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:46,070
gets the occasional release it just

00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:49,040
isn't acceptable in distributions so

00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:53,020
yeah basically back to what Jonathan

00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,020
said it is not a straightforward problem

00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:10,850
another feature that users expect to

00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:14,630
happen is user reviews and user feedback

00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:16,220
in a fair and transparent way and I

00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,780
think most people are quite savvy at

00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,640
knowing well this is you use a review so

00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:22,360
it'll be biased and it'll be it

00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,650
especially the people with a particular

00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,330
grievance or something unlikely to do it

00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:29,540
so it's a limited way but I think most

00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:31,070
people will be wise to that because what

00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,810
they see us everywhere from Amazon to

00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:36,190
every other website now there is a known

00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:38,690
web service that does reviews of

00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,690
applications and that's integrated into

00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:43,790
discover it's an open question whether

00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:46,280
or not it should be integrated into the

00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,870
applications website or not I don't know

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,660
or maybe a link I don't know

00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:53,990
certainly the applications website those

00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:56,960
upstream URLs they're great for Linux

00:58:53,990 --> 00:59:00,250
desktop users but we support other app

00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,560
stores and its future work to be done to

00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:06,280
have this point to a Google Play Store

00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:09,860
or Windows Store or all the other source

00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:13,940
to make sure that people know everywhere

00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:15,890
that they can get it yeah so obviously I

00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:18,140
have a vested interest in people using

00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:22,000
the open collaboration services but the

00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:24,620
particulars here odrs

00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,960
effectively a subset of the

00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:31,070
functionality of a static version of

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,750
collaboration service and it works it

00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:36,770
changed recently we had to do a minor

00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:42,980
fix both it works and for that sort of

00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:46,520
thing yeah it's like Jonathan says it's

00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:50,720
when we are dealing with reasonably

00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:56,300
savvy users here they people are aware

00:59:50,720 --> 01:00:00,230
today of what user reviews mean and yeah

00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:02,720
I think we can like we have two options

01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:05,150
right we can either ignore the ability

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,760
to do user reviews or we can allow them

01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:12,950
and then hope that people understand

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:15,680
what they're for I just want to add

01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:19,610
going back to the amok there in case of

01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,190
snappin flat-pack if like a base library

01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:27,020
like good for or disappears from your

01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:30,340
distribution you have snap or basically

01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:35,180
you just bundle the library inside into

01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:37,400
with the application itself so it just

01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:40,360
gives you like more work of the

01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:43,160
maintenance but you still can shape your

01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:46,190
application even and some older library

01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:48,770
is removed from removed from the base so

01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:59,540
you still have a way of solve this

01:00:48,770 --> 01:01:01,970
problem if anybody else you have any

01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,760
more questions you talk to any one of

01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:06,650
them later on so thank you so much to

01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,190
complete back panel it was a useful

01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,190
discussion
