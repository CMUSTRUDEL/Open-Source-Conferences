Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Qt has its own way of doing things, and we've been following that in our code and APIs since forever. However, since C++11 and on, the language itself started introducing more and more features to make the code safer and easier to understand. In this talk, I will show a few examples of what tools Modern C++ has to offer to make your code and your APIs more expressive and how to use those tools with Qt.
