Title: Christoph Haag - Moving KDE to another Reality - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	AR and VR did not only introduce a new class of output devices, but with tracked controllers and hands also the requirement for a new set of user interactions. This talk investigates solutions in existing implementations and points out how the classical UX model with keyboard and mouse translates to these new devices. The technical aspect of these requirements will also be highlighted. The audience will get an overview of the status of Open Source in XR and the opportunities for KDE.
We will propose an implementation that integrates VR in the KDE desktop, featuring 3D window management and desktop input synthesis.
