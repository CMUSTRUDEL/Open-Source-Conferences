Description: 
	Currently, we are observing an incredible development in technologies, especially in Artificial Intelligence field. Indeed, by learning from massive data, AI is particularly good at some tasks that normal algorithms cannot achieve as good level of performance, such as: image classification, speech recognition, object detection, tendency prediction, feature extraction, etc. Moreover, new AI algorithms with the emergence of neural networks and deep learning even makes AI models more robust, so that they can now give better prediction without any limitation in improving themselves.

Being aware of those assets, digiKam team has considered using deep learning in digiKam. Thus, this presentation aims to introduce a new implementation of facial recognition in digiKam, based on deep learning models and OpenCV DNN module, so as to improve the performance of facial recognition module.
