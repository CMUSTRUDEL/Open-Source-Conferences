Title: Michiel Leenaars - NGI0: Come Work for the Internet - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	The Next Generation Internet initiative is the first real opportunity to put significant public funding to work to really fix the post-Snowden internet. NGI was bootstrapped in 2016 at the initiative of the European Commission. The ambition of NGI is "to re-imagine and re-engineer the internet for the third millennium and beyond" - and that is actually not exaggerating the importance of the effort. The internet impacts and shapes all of our modern society, and so it needs to be trustworthy and sustainable, both societally, economically and environmentally. And it needs to be robust and resilient, so our society can responsibly rely on it. As a technical community we need to think and invent ahead to actually deliver security, fairness and privacy by design.

During this talk, Michiel Leenaars will present NGI Zero - a unique collaborative grantmaking effort built on decades of not-for profit expertise, with its pedigree tracing back to the introduction of internet in Europe in the eighties of the previous century.
