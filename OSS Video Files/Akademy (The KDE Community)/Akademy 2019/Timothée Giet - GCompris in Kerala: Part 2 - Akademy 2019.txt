Title: TimothÃ©e Giet - GCompris in Kerala: Part 2 - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	In the state of India called Kerala, all public schools have been using Free-Software for more than 10 years, and GCompris is part of the curriculum. We have been working recently to complete the translation of the new version of GCompris in Malayalam, the official language of this state. This should allow to replace the old Gtk+ version that was still in use there.

hi everybody thank you for being here

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,820
challenge my name is Timothy I'm graphic

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,719
artist and developer

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:19,470
I'm the commentator on G comfy and today

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,779
we will talk about G country usage in

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,109
the state of Kerala and free software

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:28,349
history there so I will leave the mic to

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,269
aishwarya to start the first part of the

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:37,559
tour can come back after to give more

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:41,489
news on G come pre hello so before going

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,460
to more into slides first Kerala is a

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,180
Southwest parts of a state in India

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,850
which is in the southwest part with 333

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,010
million inhabitants and the official

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,770
language is Malayalam because when I say

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,550
these words you during the talk just for

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:03,199
clarification

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:05,760
so Malayalam is our language so first

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,130
quickly go through the history of free

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,710
software because it's important for G

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,890
company to why they are this attitude

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,450
accompli so free software's a history in

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,220
Kerala started with latech so first

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,350
beginning of 80s a professor a

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,700
mathematics professor and University of

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,420
Kerala brought latech in 14 floppy disks

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,100
from United States and he he started to

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,340
encourage his students to use high-tech

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,250
and do papers only using high-tech so

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,030
there were active a few active students

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,829
using latex and promoting latex and

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,399
there was a small community growing

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,590
around latech so the one of them was a

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,460
person called severe adduction who was

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,399
inspired from the technology he started

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,219
a company which uses free software which

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,070
is called River Valley technology which

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:07,140
which was a company to for typesetting

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:10,020
scientific papers and also he is the one

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,020
who sponsored the first India's first

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,020
portal for free software to host free

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,080
software

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,330
so he's still active and the company

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,590
still uses free software and promote

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:27,060
free software meanwhile there was also a

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,250
person a CEO of South Indian fisheries

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,850
Federation of fishermen societies who is

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,460
Satish Babu he got he got to know about

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,410
the technology of internet from UK

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,710
because he had a training for fisheries

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,960
management in UK he also came back into

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,210
Kerala with excited about internet

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,450
technology and he started to explore

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:52,570
more about technology at and also he

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,520
spread the word among his friends and in

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,530
the same time there was another friend

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,980
from Bangalore it's another city of

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,040
India a friend introduced him to new

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,740
Linux to first it was they were bit

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,130
doubtful about new Linux but they

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,200
started to explore and that's the small

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,990
friends group started to enjoy it newly

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,210
next so all these people together let

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,140
people around later the River Valley

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,270
company and the small Friends group all

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,700
together made new Linux users group

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:28,150
Trivandrum 20 oh my so so capital city

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,190
of Kerala and they they started to

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,380
attract more and more more people to the

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,110
user group there was also other user

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,260
groups in other parts of Kerala starting

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:43,560
from the inspiration from the same user

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:47,050
group but the the important part also

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,970
happened around this user group because

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,040
there was some a few computer science

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:56,230
students who were attracted to gnu/linux

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,600
and the the there was the first freeze

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,940
of at least first conference that

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,830
Richard Stallman participated in India

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,260
though that was happened

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,360
in Bangalore so all these computer

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,000
science students wanted to participate

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,090
in that conference day they got chance

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,940
to participate and they they were in the

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,250
they were listening to the talk by

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,709
Richard Stallman and they were highly

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,720
attracted to the philosophy of free

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,030
software because before they were just

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,000
exploring the technology so they can

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,760
came back to Kerala

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,950
and with the user group altogether they

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,860
started more discussion around free

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,720
software philosophy and they decided to

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,650
establish Free Software Foundation of

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,350
India also they they got approval from

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,260
Richard Stallman and and they managed to

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,960
organize a conference which which was

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,120
named freedom first which was also a

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,270
conference to integrate Free Software

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,130
Foundation of India and they also got

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,010
Richard Stallman to integrate the

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,410
effects of India and even more

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,290
importantly they they campaigned our

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,180
government to support the conference so

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,240
there was government support and Richard

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,160
Stallman was the government guest of

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,410
Kerala so the as it is a government

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,690
conference that it got big media

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,850
attention and also a lot of people were

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,910
attracted to the conference because of

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,710
media attention and when Richard

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,130
Stallman came also with his long hair

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,970
and long beard people but uh who is this

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,550
person

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,640
people were curious to know who is this

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,450
what he is doing in India so altogether

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,910
that conference was very big success it

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,610
attracted much more people in Kerala and

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,740
it it started to build more and more

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:55,530
free software communities around the

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:57,540
inside the state and so the the the best

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,160
part was all this free software

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,720
foundation and all the free software

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,210
activists managed to to influence the

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,600
decision makers of Kerala and they

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,780
started to implement free software in

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,140
lots of state initiatives for example

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,890
public work department public Fisheries

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,540
Department etc but for this talk we

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:26,160
concentrate more on educational

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:28,320
department so the Kerala is the first

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,890
state in India who introduced IT

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,290
education in schools it's introduced in

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:38,039
the 8th class which means 13 year old

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,690
kid but in the first year it was just in

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,300
the textbooks it was just Microsoft

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,650
window

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,539
and Microsoft Office but free software

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,090
activists were very much pissed off by

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,620
this because first they got support from

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,990
the government and suddenly that the

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,569
Education Department doing textbooks on

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,539
Microsoft Windows so there were protests

00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:01,090
all around Kerala also there was big

00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:04,810
support from school teachers association

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,240
which had major teacher community from

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:12,280
public schools in Kerala so altogether

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:16,030
they made they managed to get approval

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,580
from the the public Department that they

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,250
decided to use only free software and

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,400
they made ith school gnu/linux

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,500
distribution based on Debian that was

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,379
the steel they use I did school

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,590
gnu/linux in all the schools so but the

00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:35,560
important decision was in 2007 before

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,020
before that all this when the decision

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,150
is made so public schools decided to

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,129
teach only free software so the first

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,219
stage was to do training for teachers

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:47,740
that was done by space which is Society

00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:50,080
for promotion of alternative computing

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,810
and employment which is an NGO that

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,840
promotes free software so they give

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,219
first training and they give technical

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,259
support for IT at school and then the

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:04,259
government made ICT policy

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,580
so the ICT policy it was the important

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,680
statement in ICT policy was the

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,810
government realizes that free software

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,120
presents a unique opportunity in

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,430
building a truly egalitarian knowledge

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,410
society the government will take all

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,420
efforts to develop free software and

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,550
free knowledge and shall encourage and

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,250
mended the appropriate use of free

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,520
software in all ICT initiatives it was a

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,200
big step for Carroll I move completely

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,040
towards free software and the decision

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:49,030
was very important so the first they

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,940
liked it all do they introduced the

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,460
introduced first in eighth eighth year

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,100
of education so first it was some

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,850
supplements of textbooks to start to use

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:04,750
computer to do mouths and to start to

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,300
experience to learn computers and Rickon

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,640
play was the big part of supplements or

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,770
so tucks pain was also there so Envy

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,010
Conway started to get popular from that

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:18,250
time from the beginning of education in

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:23,380
Kerala so it gets very popular inside

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:25,650
Kerala so she convey history in Kerala

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,800
actually starts from there but just to

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:34,360
conclude my free software history part

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:38,050
there is also important decisions but

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,690
moving I cannot say it from 2007 it 100%

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:44,820
age free software because there was one

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:49,510
stream after 15 years old we have to

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:52,060
take we have to choose our our an option

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,880
option like science or math or computer

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,250
science so there was one stream for

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,640
commerce so they were still using tally

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,640
in Windows but three or four years ago

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,070
they moved to be new kata so now it's

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,010
100% free software in the Education

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,240
Department and also the the free

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:16,090
software love in Kerala it not only this

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,890
history also I think the localization

00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,550
was very important for the free software

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,870
love just after the establishment of

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,510
free software foundation of in

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:29,290
they started localization efforts

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:32,200
because we are the English is not our

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,960
native language and only people in

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,740
university can understand or use more

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,780
English so they started localization

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,420
ever efforts from the beginning and also

00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,030
now these days there were beautiful

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,010
fonts from Swatantra Malayalam computing

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,970
which is also a free software collective

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,250
which is in the space of Indic languages

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:59,770
that's very important also for the free

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:01,690
software lab I think and and also the

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,780
thing is the first years Microsoft

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:07,510
didn't care just 38 million Malayalam

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,600
speaking community immigrants they

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,270
didn't expect us to grow in technology

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,580
that meant I think that was a point

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,740
because first localization come with

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,760
free phones and open phones it's also a

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:25,270
point to grow free software there so now

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,760
we move more towards before all this

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:31,120
information you can get from the blog

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,550
post by dr. Rishi Kumar which is the

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,640
website is there and also I had

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,680
discussion with I don't know who is

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,960
secretary of SF in FS of India and

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,840
coordinator of space he's also the one

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,810
who brought me to free software more

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,650
close to free software so now I'm moving

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:54,070
to what G company so like I told you the

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:56,380
first it was just eight year of general

00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:00,430
education free software education starts

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,080
but then then after internet and

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,930
computers started to get more popular

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,430
the government decided to start from the

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:12,340
first year of school so from first year

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,620
to fourth year of general education the

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:19,360
major parts of the textbook is recom fee

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:21,220
and also there are other a few other

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,770
applications like text paints and

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,790
another KDE application color paint I

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,310
don't know

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,220
you don't know but anyway they still

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:32,290
teach that so but still she completes

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,080
the major part so it's now it's our

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,370
first year textbook just it's the

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,400
Malayalam version I am

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,380
sure I don't think there are people who

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,180
know money Harlem so there's English

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,830
median textbook and Malay are a medium

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,930
textbook so the this the first year they

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,820
start with just most activities and

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,640
things like that and second year they

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,890
try to do more parallels to the other

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,380
subjects like for example if they are

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,150
teaching multiplication so they use we

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,810
complain multiplication activity like

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:07,450
that but it's very hard to make it

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,120
parallel but you should still try to go

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,740
to parallel with the subjects but then

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,500
and also other thing to say there are

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,250
other Kady applications that we use in

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,339
public education are color paint and K

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:28,510
stars k geography and in the higher

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,910
level classes katak lab and and those so

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,980
there is cat and live I think there are

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,279
more to the list but I don't know the

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,670
complete list in my year it was just

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,860
three years of a t education and another

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,750
after public education another

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,560
experiment happened with chicken curry

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:51,000
in Kerala is inside it's a center for

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:55,390
kids with cognitive disability so they

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,160
list it's also the they had also

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,740
technical support from space so of

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,800
course this they decided to use free

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,550
software for kids with cognitive

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,760
disability they choose they choose G

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,830
country because they from their feedback

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,440
they said it's about the pleasant design

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:18,040
and simplicity of G company for example

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:21,160
they said the the smiling flower after

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,140
each activity it was very simple and the

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,660
one word we have but in the background

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:30,070
it was much simpler for kids other than

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:33,130
a big uproar and complex images and lot

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:38,130
of mess that was a very important thing

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:41,980
from them but unfortunately they are

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,320
they don't they don't sustain because of

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,420
financial reason at least this year they

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,209
had big problems with financial things

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,110
but still there are big motivation for G

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,150
company and

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,140
if someone wants to refer their handbook

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:58,510
I have that and another important thing

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,900
I miss that in Lee Kum Kee in public

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:05,170
schools they use all gtk version but

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,630
after I localize recovery I inform them

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,000
but it will take time after all this

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,700
bureaucracy process to change all these

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,280
textbooks for male are a medium English

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,950
medium tamil medium there's a lot of

00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,020
medium inside the state it will take

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:26,200
time but for now if they are using gtk

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:29,170
version so now I move towards my work so

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,780
when I started to do the complete

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,600
localization or else that I decided to

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,410
do localization I was not using

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,440
malayalam inputs in my computer because

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,920
in Kerala I got my my own computer when

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,170
I was thirty euros University and I was

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,540
struggling with English at that time so

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,790
I wanted to see more English words and

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,640
use English so I didn't use male are an

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,450
input for learning reason so the first

00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,760
thing was to choose Malayalam kebab I am

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:04,510
good at bippo which is a French

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,120
equivalent of Doric so I chose Malayalam

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,160
in script keyboards for the that prison

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,050
because the vowels and consonants are in

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,810
similar positions and next thing it was

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,180
not very the installation was ok but

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,840
then there was a problem to switch

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,300
keyboard

00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,880
I was alone that time and to switch

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,300
keyboard I didn't manage to to put the

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,310
keyboard shortcut but I would say I

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,500
didn't try that much because I saw

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,630
Timothy was using plus mine he always

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,320
switch the keyboard and he always say

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:41,530
you see plasma do that plasma do this so

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,530
I moved to plasma and of course I

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:47,050
started with other KD application so I

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,960
used localized to translate and there

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:53,200
comes the next issue when I use localize

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,230
when I type male Arum it's all red

00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,390
underline comes and I started I thought

00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,660
this was first it's localized issue and

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,580
then all the KD applications show in all

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,459
the Malayalam what's wrong with

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,190
spellchecker and I saw a bug which is

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,970
one seven six five seven which is ten

00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,060
years old

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,880
and which is filed by Santos 13l which

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,540
is a language professional in Malayalam

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,839
so first I was a bit sad I just switched

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,780
to plasma and I the first impression was

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,240
also KDE don't care about Malayalam

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,750
community it was the first impression

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,470
but anyway my priority was the work so

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,870
it continued to work and and that's also

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,110
why I didn't go behind the bug that much

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:44,290
at that time but during Academy I'm sure

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:48,310
I want to fix somehow or at least find

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:53,620
their way to fix how to fix that so and

00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:57,010
then next and then next comes the font

00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:01,120
issues in Milan there are lots of open

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:03,160
phones and but the Jigen friendship with

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,830
default phone call and Digger which is

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,160
for design for latin scripts so i have

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,640
to suggest or we have to suggest a phone

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,160
4g compe mich font have to use so I

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,440
started to learn more about phones and

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,470
more about my own language from that

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,730
point so Malayalam is a complex language

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:27,370
which evolved from Burma which is an

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,830
ancient language Sanskrit is another lab

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,690
actual language in India like that broom

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,260
is another one which is small in South

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,020
India

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,380
so Malayalam evolved from Brahmi through

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:41,380
Granta alphabet and what are they

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,860
writing system it's South Indian

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:48,100
language systems so and also there are

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,170
we have thousand about or more than

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,920
thousand two hundred briefings in our

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:57,130
language so as it's very complex

00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:01,060
language the typesetting was very hot so

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:04,060
the government decided in 70s I think to

00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,980
reform the orthography so they simplify

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,900
the orthography which is called reformed

00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,720
orthography in Malayalam for typesetting

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,520
reasons so the all the textbooks start

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,690
to use reformed orthography

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,930
so but still all the kids learn

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,140
seeing watching tradition orthography

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,760
because all the graffitis postures

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,280
morhen writings were all in traditional

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,870
orthography anyway so that textbooks are

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,260
you Singlish from the orthography so i

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:34,840
chose to use reformed orthography so I

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:38,200
first tried the coup Malayalam Suns

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,450
which is a open font from Malayalam so I

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,470
tried and then for all the cute

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:48,130
applications in that font we had a bug

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:51,880
that a consonant has unwanted dot inside

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:54,940
that inside the curve so I managed to

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,820
fix that bug and did the patch so it got

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,090
one so it was in the end it was okay to

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,340
suggest so we suggest Raghu Malayalam

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,670
Sons and natto sense Malayalam which is

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:11,580
also default and Android so that are

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:14,050
both phones we suggest and then next was

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,570
so I had finished the all the

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:19,660
translation it took two months for me

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:23,800
first it was I have very there's the

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:26,500
small very slow typing speed was also

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,110
recent for slower work but then in the

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,440
end I could manage to attain a good

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,470
speed and also there was big issues for

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,020
translating some words especially some

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,020
vegetables which are only in the global

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,890
north for example leak in friend it's

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:47,290
paho but this vegetable we don't know in

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:50,560
Kerala so you have to do more research

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:53,010
and also some words more culturally

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,230
related to here for example blonde

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,960
before starting to learn more wisdom

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,530
things I didn't even know people have

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,430
different color of hair and FSL so these

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:09,390
words were hard to translate but after

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:12,520
some research some words anyway couldn't

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:15,390
including do complete only option was

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,920
okay just to don't put in the country

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,350
anyway but the public schools use

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,900
customized version so it's not a big

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,320
problem for them they they change some

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,779
pictures things like that and then after

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,359
translated all the text then I did

00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:34,879
record and website translation which was

00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,429
financially supported by icy force which

00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:41,090
is an autonomous government institution

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:43,580
in Kerala its international center for

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,219
free and open source software which is

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,830
government organization just promote and

00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:52,039
open hardware and free software so they

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:55,580
supported me and for voice recording I

00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,469
used a duo and audacity but the

00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,599
recording it was also my first time

00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:03,589
doing voice records I thought it's a

00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:07,450
very easy task so I just counted five

00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:10,489
days of work but in the end it was I

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,769
didn't think of outside noise and I

00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:15,589
cannot control outside noise and also to

00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:18,349
to make my voice clear for a long

00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:20,450
duration so in the end it took more than

00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:27,499
two weeks to finish all the work anyway

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:30,469
I finished it and but in the first first

00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:33,259
person who who tested after me and

00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:35,869
timotei was my mother she completely

00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:38,330
localized version and I'm happy that she

00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:40,669
started to learn to use computer because

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,249
she said she's more comfortable with my

00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:46,429
voice and there's full of Malayalam so

00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:48,229
she start to use mouse and learning more

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,739
computer will she come play now so I'm

00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:54,649
happy with that user feedback and also

00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:56,719
the schools at least the schools near my

00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:59,570
village I will do when I go to India I

00:22:56,719 --> 00:23:01,339
will do the cute version installation

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,399
many ways it will be bare so I will get

00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:06,259
more user feedback so that's it and I'm

00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:09,889
happy with my work there are some

00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:13,190
modifications but still I'm happy with

00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,529
that and also it also opened a new area

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,690
for me that's Malayalam typography where

00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:20,359
there are lot of things to do a lot of

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:27,139
books to think so I'm happy and easy

00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:30,080
with the phones Thank You H so I will go

00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:33,710
fast for the end of the talk because

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,629
your bit out of schedule so for the

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,470
future we have plans to improve the

00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:41,450
customization of

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,150
the application for the different

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:48,170
cultures because as she said for some

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:51,410
cultures some words like vegetables or

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:54,320
animals or not relevant at all so in the

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,140
old ETA version it was relatively easy

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,210
because for some activities you could

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,450
include customized assets in a

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,990
user-defined folder which was very easy

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:08,390
but for the new code version because we

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,820
we compile all the assets in our CC

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:14,510
files then it's a bit more complicated

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,180
because it's a binary format and people

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,340
cannot explore what's inside or modify

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,040
it easily they have to have technical

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,200
background to know how to recompile the

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,010
application or just compile OCC files

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:35,330
separately which is not so easy so our

00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:37,310
plan is to have localized datasets so it

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,470
would be a way to provide different

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,900
datasets downloaded from the way the way

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:45,790
the same way we provide localized voices

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:49,570
now depending on the user settings and

00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:51,830
we want to build that upon the multiple

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,840
multiple data set system which we are

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:59,150
currently working on I will talk just

00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,980
after so of course if some people are

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:07,040
interested to help on that front to

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:12,260
either have to bring back to the option

00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,970
to use assets from a folder or work on

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,640
the localized that I said please come to

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,090
the workshop on Tuesday afternoon you're

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,090
very welcome

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:26,810
so a bit of is frequently last year we

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,250
released three new versions

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:33,920
0:19 mash with 890 beetee's 0 91 in May

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,930
which was bug fix and 0 95 in the

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,870
suburbs began seven more activities

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:43,580
which was increasing a lot the number of

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:45,790
activities and this year we made a new

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,659
Mac host version in January which was

00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:51,570
you long time due because

00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:56,729
when was 52 from more than three years

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:59,039
ago and then we still don't have any

00:25:56,729 --> 00:26:01,440
idea if or when we will update the iOS

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,429
version because we don't have any device

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,979
to test it so and also for ethical

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:10,529
reason I don't intend to buy any so

00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:12,179
we'll see but it's not our priority

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:16,139
anyway we prefer to have packages for

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,570
Raspberry Pi for example and then in

00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:21,179
March we release 0 96 which was a back

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,789
piece but fix but also mostly a

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,190
translation release because we had six

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:30,929
languages updated which bring total

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:34,559
language of fully translated to 19 and

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:37,229
we have 15 partially translated so it

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,359
makes 30 languages we still have room

00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:44,340
for improvement the old gtk version had

00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,899
reached 50 translations so we welcome

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,869
all the communities which are not

00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:51,299
represented in the new version then in

00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:54,059
July we released a 64-bit version of

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,830
Android which was mandatory for the New

00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,799
York to comply to the new requirement of

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:02,009
the Android Play Store and the same

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,499
month we finally have Deccan free

00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:07,169
available on a fluid official

00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:09,269
repositories which took a very long time

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:12,090
to get there because in the first place

00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:15,509
do after eight people they didn't have

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:17,429
an easy way to build a cute application

00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:21,059
that complied with their requirement

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:23,340
because they want to use only Debian

00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,809
packages to build and the Debian

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,820
packages of cute don't provide the

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:32,729
Android SDK of cute so in the end after

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:36,899
a long discussion they agreed to just

00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:39,450
use the cute Installer and which makes

00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:42,029
it seems much more easier so for every

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,379
other KDE application that want to go to

00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:46,289
have the right now it should be much

00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:50,429
much more easier so don't don't hesitate

00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:54,239
to get in touch with them here it is and

00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:56,159
then for the next release we big things

00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,019
we've been working on instead of new

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,950
activities we added the first

00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:04,029
subcategories which was a request

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:05,830
from teacher which because for some of

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,750
the categories the most crowded word it

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,909
was getting hard to navigate and find

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,460
the one they want so we added

00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:15,399
subcategories which easier to find for

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,010
each topic the relevant activities and

00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,799
then the next very big thing is multiple

00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,960
datasets which allows us to separate the

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,860
content of activities in different

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,070
datasets

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:30,039
I made the design of the features and

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,380
Johnny the other commentator cadet the

00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,029
groundwork for it and we had a ji-suk

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,210
student we did very good work

00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:39,789
integrating a lot of activities to that

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,519
so we have now more than 20 activities

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,860
using the multiple datasets and the

00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,990
other big thing for next release is the

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,429
painting activity for which we also had

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,399
the district student last year which

00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:53,769
made good progress but then finish

00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,840
completely so this year I spent a lot of

00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:59,409
time working on trying to finish it

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,659
but sadly first it works very good

00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:04,570
analytics but sadly on Android there's a

00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:08,409
very specific bug which make it unusable

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:12,159
so if anyone is as some experience with

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:14,200
the canva QML element on Android please

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,440
come to me and let's see if we can fix

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,559
that bug that's all for the news for

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,180
next release thank you for your

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,130
attention

00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:27,230
[Applause]

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,840
I don't know if you have time for any

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,840
questions or if there are any question

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,420
when is one point not coming out when

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:48,440
that's zero we should release it next

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,730
year I think because we need to in the

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,830
first place we wanted to reach full

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,200
parity with the ojtk version which we

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,880
almost reached we have maybe two

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,000
activities missing which are not the

00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,560
most important ones and but now we

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,330
because we have the big change with the

00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,760
multiple data set we want to have as

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:09,790
much activities ported to that system

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:15,290
before 1.0 so it should be for next year

00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:17,720
any other questions alright let's wrap

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:21,539
thank you

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,539
