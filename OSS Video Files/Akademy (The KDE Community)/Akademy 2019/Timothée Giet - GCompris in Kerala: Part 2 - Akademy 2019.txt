Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	In the state of India called Kerala, all public schools have been using Free-Software for more than 10 years, and GCompris is part of the curriculum. We have been working recently to complete the translation of the new version of GCompris in Malayalam, the official language of this state. This should allow to replace the old Gtk+ version that was still in use there.
