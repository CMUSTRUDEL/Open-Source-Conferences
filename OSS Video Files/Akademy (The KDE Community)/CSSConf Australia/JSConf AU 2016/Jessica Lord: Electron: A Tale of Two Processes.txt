Title: Jessica Lord: Electron: A Tale of Two Processes

	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

Electron is a framework for building desktop applications with web languages. It's a powerful tool allowing you to ship one codebase to three operating systems but it's also a new, and sometimes confusing, context in which to develop.

The Electron context is that of two processes: the main and renderer. Together they are a fundamental part of every Electron app and what make Electron, well, Electron. The two share some behavior but not all and their differences are important.

After this talk it will all make sense. We'll distill the roles of each, how they work together to make the magical HTML with Node.js wonderland of Electron and cover best practices for developing and debugging.
