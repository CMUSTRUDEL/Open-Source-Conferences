	Thank you to Mozilla for making the video recordings possible.

This talk has it all! You'll be amazed at how powerful the browser has become: ✓ Augmented Reality. ✓ Location Aware. ✓ Serverless Peer-to-peer. ✓ Super Fast 3D.

We'll piece together powerful browser APIs using nothing more than the
phone you have in your pocket, and Google Chrome to build a location aware,
multi-user, augmented reality game. All in 100% JavaScript!

Thanks to the amazing Open Source work in the community, it's never been easier
to harness these browser super powers. In half an hour, we'll make use of WebVR, WebGL, WebRTC, GeoLocationAPI, and WebTorrent, bringing it all together in a few short lines of code.

Who knows, it could be you building the next multi-million $ per day game in JS!
