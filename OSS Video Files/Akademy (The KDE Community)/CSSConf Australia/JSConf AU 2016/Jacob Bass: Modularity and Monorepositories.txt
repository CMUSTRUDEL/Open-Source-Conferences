Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making video recording possible.

The delivery of Babel re-opened the debate in the JavaScript community around the structure or large projects. Out of the babel project came Lerna.js, a tool intended to simplify the development and management of complex projects with many related modules that should be developed simultaneously but delivered separately.

This talk will introduce the concept of a monorepository and explain the benefits and drawbacks of such a system. It will demonstrate how to use a monorepository to build and maintain a component library allowing a team to generate a living style guide but still publish each component as a separate npm module.
