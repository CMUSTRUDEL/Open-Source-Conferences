Publication date: 2017-05-19

Description: 
	Thank you, Mozilla for making the video recording possible.

It's 2016 and virtual reality devices are finally ready to delight a large audience. Besides some proprietary tools there is also a new API to create VR experiences in the browser. This talk will give you an overview of the WebVR ecosystem, beginning with a short introduction to WebGL, VR devices, and basic VR concepts, like head tracking sensors, the field of view and stereoscopic 3d images. 

You will also see the current status of the WebVR API in action with some code samples of a 360 degree video for VR and – of course – fallback devices. Which leads to another important point of this talk: the struggles of creating VR applications today. There are a lot of unanswered questions, e.g. UX design challenges, input devices, motion sickness or browser support. This is why the talk ends with resources like frameworks, markup languages and polyfills.
