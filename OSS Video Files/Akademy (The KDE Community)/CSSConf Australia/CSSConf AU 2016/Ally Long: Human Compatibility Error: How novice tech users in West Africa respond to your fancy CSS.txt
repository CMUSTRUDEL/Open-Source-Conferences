Title: Ally Long: Human Compatibility Error: How novice tech users in West Africa respond to your fancy CSS
Publication date: 2017-05-19
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2016
Description: 
	Thank you to Mozilla for making the video recording possible.

We can do so much cool stuff with CSS now! Animations are totally boss. Focus effects are so much fun. We barely even have to worry about browser compatibility any more!

Ok, hold up. What about human compatibility? How does a newbie react to something like an animated input focus effect when trying to fill out an online form? We can probably all fairly easily venture outside our meme bubble and ask a Luddite relative to test our app. But letâ€™s move even further outside the comfort zone. What about people in places with unreliable power and intermittent internet? How does someone who's been introduced to technology through a second-hand cheap Blackberry knock-off powered by a car battery respond to these new and shiny ways of interacting with machines? (Hint: ðŸ˜±) Do animations hinder or help? Does a flat UI give people enough clues about how to use an interface? How can we make sure that keeping up with the cutting edge wonâ€™t alienate people in these fast-growing emerging economies who are just starting to get into the web?

hi everyone this is on yes ki crispiness

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,270
as I wonderful welcome and thank you for

00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,610
the organizers this is an amazing venue

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,340
and now thank you for the glass of

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:30,380
champagne it's a really taken the edge

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:32,119
off my jet lag here i can now in my jet

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,910
lag state I was kind of thinking about

00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,280
my talk titled how nervous tech use is

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,120
in West Africa respond to your fancy CSS

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,710
and I kind of realized that it does it

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,109
maybe sounds a little bit belligerent

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,129
it's just definitely like she didn't

00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:51,649
spank in there but I am actually very

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,899
excited to be here and I don't want this

00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:57,050
to be a very strict lecture about what

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,729
you change and I heard that at the end

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,350
of this book you'll be as excited about

00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:05,570
making products and people in the

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,950
developing world as I am so high thanks

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,570
for thanks for being here thanks for

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:14,570
having me and my name is Ellie lung I'm

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,210
lel on twitter and we're still the

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,450
places on the internet is it actually in

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,310
their dirty mistook by the way it

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,729
secures miss let it be audience on what

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,460
to expect so I'm a product designer in

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,780
the front end developer and I haven't

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,759
lived here for a while but I do come

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,590
from Melbourne so I'm really really

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,479
happy to be giving the smoking Melvin

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:40,039
because this is really where my career

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:43,210
began when my love of CSF again but I've

00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:45,320
come quite a long way from home to spend

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,799
so i worked as a designer and developer

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,149
in melbourne i worked with a lot of

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,229
great people and we did really cool

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:55,670
stuff and I love CSS I loved when I

00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,490
started like figuring out the cool

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,740
things you could do with it and as CSS

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,149
itself developed I love in there all the

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,200
effects from the animations that we

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:08,509
could create and then I'm just a broad a

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,330
work of working agencies in Berlin

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:14,480
worked at each week common and a color

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,010
bright and in these places really we

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,840
really kind of cranked up the cool stuff

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,660
to whom you love

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,959
and it was really really fun working at

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,050
these places we did a lot of exciting

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,090
work for a lot of exciting clients and

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,910
they wanted really cool stuff they

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,950
wanted the latest and greatest they

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,080
wanted to shiniest stuff like the most

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,180
cutting-edge stuff we did a lot of work

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,000
for red bull and I believe Academy for

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,420
able to send yours truly front shelf and

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,700
a lot more so we did really great work

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,430
like creating these like really

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:53,260
immersive experiences to delight their

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,860
customers but if you use ago a change

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,709
direction of it now I'm working for an

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,150
NGO called a health Africa so we get

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,489
funding from organizations like the

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,150
Gates Foundation UNICEF the Center for

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:08,709
Disease Control to work on programs

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,910
public health programs and emergency out

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,560
big outbreak response in West Africa so

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,540
the things that we build a teahouse

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,769
Africa are very different from the kinds

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,620
of things that I used to build for

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,389
clients like Red Bull the problems that

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,600
we're trying to solve and not customer

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,910
engagement or selling products there are

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,730
problems like the Ebola virus and pull

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:35,560
your sleeping sickness vaccine delivery

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,329
maternal health and a lot more so when I

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,069
was working in agencies fieldwork used

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:42,430
to mean like during say London for red

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,989
bull music events and user research was

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,010
like hanging out with music industry

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:52,720
people field work now is very very

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:54,370
different it means piling onto the back

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,440
of a motorcycle or until four wheel

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,540
drive and accompanying teams of

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,120
vaccinators and other kinds of health

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,030
workers to really remote settlements in

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,500
West Africa a visiting health facilities

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,660
like this which is very very different

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,239
from the kinds of health facilities that

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,560
you find in Australia and Germany

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,130
they're often you know like three walls

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,630
in the roof towel and no electricity

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:21,960
they might have a working code books for

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:25,599
vaccines and sometimes a small ambulance

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,340
so this context meant I needed to take a

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,380
very different approach to designing and

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,190
building products

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,060
this was really human centered design in

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,520
like third degree that I'd never

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,800
experienced before so my Turkish really

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,680
had to switch from how cool can we make

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,530
this to how do we make this as useful as

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,340
possible in what is sometimes very very

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,200
critical situations so I want to quickly

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,200
tell you a little bit more about some of

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,030
the apps that we've worked on so we were

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,080
part of quite a few a bowl of response

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,610
initiatives one example was an app that

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,490
health workers used to keep track of

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:08,350
people in Liberia and Sierra Leone

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,700
liquids Sierra Leone so we would keep

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,450
track of people who had contact with

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,460
people who who had a bola so these

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,040
health workers doing this contact

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,010
tracing were an incredibly important

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,990
part of this abola response and their

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,270
job was to travel from settlement to

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,400
settlement looking for and keeping track

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,980
of anyone who had come into contact with

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,520
someone who had a bola so these health

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,620
work is they use this up to follow up on

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,900
people to record their details record

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,090
any symptoms that they might have and

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,370
their location so this meant that we

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,870
could pulling all this data we could see

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:49,960
the positions of all the infected people

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:52,710
and other at-risk people not another

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,930
project we work on is to send out teams

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:59,800
on polio vaccination campaigns in remote

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,660
communities in northern Nigeria said

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,210
Boko Haram actually control a lot of the

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,940
northeast of Nigeria and they have

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:12,280
declared polio vaccinations as a Western

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,390
conspiracy to sterilize Muslims so a lot

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,670
of these areas are very very

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,320
inaccessible but these teams of

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,270
vaccinators would stop every household

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,890
that they could access they would

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,320
administer vaccines any children they

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,690
could find and we captured a lot of this

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,600
to your location data while they were at

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,180
this and we mapped out these previously

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,940
unmapped under in areas and we built a

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,540
dashboard to see where the black spots

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,950
were and where the resources are needed

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,560
we've also worked on programs to

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,639
renovate health facilities in guinea so

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,780
these are places that had

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:50,680
water no electricity a lot of very basic

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:54,159
services plenty of motorcycle talking

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,279
sometimes and we created a system to

00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:00,099
replace these paper-based books that

00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,469
they had so that health workers that

00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,689
could report data about the kinds of

00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,669
diseases and incidences that occurred

00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:10,529
there so that nationally you could know

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:14,110
how many people had they had malaria or

00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:15,520
we're showing Ebola symptoms or how many

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,770
people died and how many people were

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,870
born they also made an app that helps

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,110
workers use when I go out into the

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,439
remote jungles of a democratic republic

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,469
of congo the dlc and they would test

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,210
people for African sleeping sickness so

00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,900
this is very easily treatable disease

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,749
it's actually fatal if it is left

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,159
untreated so this app registered details

00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:43,659
of the peoples in the villages and it

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,339
guides the health workers through this

00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:48,279
process of the various tests that they

00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,050
need to do to confirm a diagnosis and we

00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,240
also created in the coming dashboard up

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,000
to analyze all the start of it they

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,289
brought back with them and to be able to

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,819
plan where they send people so I think

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,129
you can probably see there's a bit of a

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,750
pattern here we do a lot of mobile apps

00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,399
that we send out with health workers to

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,589
collect data and we usually have a

00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,430
dashboard to accompany them to analyze

00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:16,569
this stuff so what is the typical

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,430
african youth alike well there's no real

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,819
typical user in Africa just like there's

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,219
no real typical australian visa I've

00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,500
encountered people across a really broad

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,719
spectrum of experience and level of

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,909
comfort and knowledge with digital

00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:32,289
products and a lot of people in West

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:35,829
Africa are actually very very

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:40,449
comfortable using ferns and puters and

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:49,680
tablets and laptops all sorts of digital

00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:49,680
interfaces open my presentations broken

00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:09,390
he's been here I might skip ahead to a

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:10,620
few non broken screens so a lot of

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,970
people a lot of people are very

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,200
comfortable they have like multiple

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:18,450
devices multiple smartphones they use

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,710
like multiple sim cards to maximize the

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,050
amount of coverage they have on what

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:26,580
it's generally pretty shitty cellular

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,050
networks actually have a taxi driver in

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,140
Nigeria that had like three different

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,540
phones plus a separate music device that

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,870
using all of them at the same time live

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,440
to tell the tale and you know I have

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:44,580
colleagues as well in Guinea who that

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:53,370
are like bigger Apple fanboys and people

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:55,320
a glance hello Thank You mr. Burke sir

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,990
yeah I certainly don't want to give the

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,700
impression that that everyone in Africa

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:06,510
is like confused by this shiny new

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:14,990
technology maybe it was just a few ones

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:20,240
she slides at working cool thanks anyway

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,240
thanks for nothing sssss

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,029
haha anyway sure the type of person that

00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:30,449
I do want to talk to you about there is

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,190
like the novice tech user that we

00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:34,160
encountered quite a lot of these people

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,329
on the Lud's of projects was working on

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
so these are people that had never used

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:41,730
a smart burn before I never used a

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,410
desktop or a laptop computer there are

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,610
people who had to go from using pen and

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:50,190
paper to do their work to using an app

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,199
if they weren't completely new to it

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,569
than they were often relatively new to

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:57,930
it that was very recently introduced to

00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:59,310
digital technology so they probably got

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,380
their first phone at a place like this

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,540
at a street market and it was probably

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,649
something very cheap probably second

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:12,389
hand and probably also a knockoff like

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,769
just a fake Chinese blackberry and they

00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,800
would have taken it home to the house it

00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,509
might not have had power so they would

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,670
have had to charge at friar generator or

00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,230
on a car battery or they would have had

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,199
to walk to a relative's house to charge

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,529
it or maybe they had to pay someone

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:30,240
who'd set up a charging station so I

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,630
think you kind of get the picture i mean

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,649
we're making apps are very for people

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:40,829
who live in a very different kind of

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:43,860
environment to the one we have here so i

00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:46,649
want to talk a little bit about how this

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,420
kind of influenced our process and we

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:52,649
always have to kind of start with the

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,990
sort of devices that we'd see so smart

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:59,730
phones they usually look something like

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,860
this these why chinese firms are very

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,480
very common and they often have you

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,769
can't see it too well in this picture

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:11,430
but they have like glare protection and

00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:14,519
offering very rugged covers they almost

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,769
always android phones and almost always

00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:22,350
very cheap hardware so we have y and

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:26,569
lenovo LG duty from samsung device is

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:30,120
there but they're like higher end and

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:30,830
Apple iOS devices you see very very

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,200
rarely

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,880
very occasionally they're quite a set of

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,440
simple so you get some real work horses

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,920
you don't see many inner legs week's

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,630
naked iPhones around you they often have

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,480
very scratched up screens are they very

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,150
protected they have like these

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:56,180
protection covers and big rugged cases

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:57,770
whole boxes rug Doug tablets they're

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,250
probably not going to be connected a lot

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,810
of the time and this is either because

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,240
they're there just is no coverage

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,560
there's very little coverage in remote

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,800
areas of West Africa and broadband very

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,360
very uncommon or because the daughter is

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,370
actually really expensive compared to

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,610
your in proportion to your average

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,990
income so where possible like it is

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,880
really great to be able to build in some

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,130
kind of offline functionality and this

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:33,790
is where we always start the work that

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:35,690
we do this is such an awesome pictures

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,570
they're going to be really hard to

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,880
charge so until everyone knows this

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,050
particular feeling of panic where you

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,820
know you get the ten percent battery

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:49,790
warning well you can imagine seeing that

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,170
low battery warning pop up but the

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,860
nearest place you can charge your phone

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,420
is an hour's walk away at one of the

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,740
health facilities that we renovated

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,130
recently in Guinea we put solar panels

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,050
on the roof and when I visited them

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,000
every single one that had solar panels

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:09,010
had a device plugged into every Power

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,010
Point in this health facility charging

00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,570
but it does take longer to charge

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,450
referring that way sir a generator will

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,910
take maybe two hours each other for

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,740
solar panels will it will take twice as

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,230
long to charge take four or five hours

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,710
to charge so if you're out for your

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,990
website sucks up battery life with some

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,660
fancy then you're going to make

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:37,370
someone walk for an hour to judge the

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,170
phone again now we've always found it

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:43,430
touch screen to easier for people to use

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,740
than laptops we recently child a program

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,720
where we

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,780
gave health workers laptops rather than

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,960
tablets to do their reports and it was

00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,940
way way slower so most people have been

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,710
introduced to technology via smartphones

00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,060
and using a laptop or desktop with some

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,700
with with inputs that are very

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:08,190
disconnected from the screen is very

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:10,490
unintuitive very slow to type so about I

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,380
mean what you actually see on the screen

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,920
if it's on the screen then you're in

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,920
trouble now I know you probably also

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:24,840
moved on from this like everyone knows

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,270
how to scroll kind of thing people don't

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,940
know how to scroll it's actually a

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,440
really uninteresting for novice users or

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,420
anything that sells canvas and if you

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,130
need to scroll for of canvas navigation

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:42,930
these sort of patterns and very very

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,880
difficult to use so I want to take this

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,570
example this is dummy content based on

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,070
an actual app that we have in use it's

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,170
quite a simple form it also some

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:56,750
rudimentary identifying details for a

00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:00,240
person but it's quite deceptively simple

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,600
I mean how do you know that there's more

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,070
stuff below the edge of the window here

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,620
where's the button to go forward on to

00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:11,780
go backwards and we only know this stuff

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:14,670
because we just know it it's obvious and

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,260
it's only really obvious because we

00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,010
already know it we've had like years of

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,140
evolution of digital interfaces to get

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,700
used to this kind of stuff and this

00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,530
doesn't even show any like validation

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,410
errors which brings up a whole new level

00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,570
of complexity and with every validation

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:34,350
error people with confidence and they

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,210
get frustrated so an alternative method

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,890
one that we've had some success with is

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:42,180
to get people to input data in a sort of

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:44,370
wizard style interface so 11 maintain /

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,600
screen and this seems a bit tedious to

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,390
people who are very comfortable you

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,150
might seem a bit slower but I mean we

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,460
much rather have more text tech savvy

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,240
people complain about it being a bit

00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,890
tedious

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,470
to have novice tech users have no idea

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,870
how to use it so we broke down the

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,329
interface to one main task or action

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,480
first screen on cs4 name and then you're

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:10,470
asked for a date of birth you know it

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,000
takes a kind of form of a

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:19,520
question-and-answer style of interface

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,520
it's much more natural sort of mechanism

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,559
and we wanted to get people doing things

00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,699
with as little training as possible so

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,439
that people are focused on their work

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:33,390
and not unlearning how to use an

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:36,900
interface and on a similar kind of note

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,550
the avoid concealed elements at all

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,530
costs so the prime example here is a

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:46,170
select tag which there's a lot of stuff

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:49,320
hidden here this is really not great

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,300
resolution but so this is a very common

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,010
kind of task for us health workers go

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,050
out to a location and they have to

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,110
choose they have to tell the up where

00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,030
they are and it is usually have some

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,580
kind of hierarchy like provinces are in

00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:06,030
an area and the most obvious way to do

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,530
this is to have select tags and then

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,179
that populates the subsequent select

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:13,890
tags based on on what they've chosen

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:15,179
before but it's very confusing all of

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,950
this stuff is then hidden away behind

00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:20,100
things that you have to click on or tap

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:23,270
on and changing a selection further down

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,820
the tree means that it resets all of the

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,110
this stuff that you've already input and

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,150
a lot of people all over the world have

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:34,320
trouble with select tags is not really

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:36,380
not specific to to West Africa so this

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,880
is the alternative that we came up with

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,429
so this is this is a map this is three

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,320
separate screens in the workflow and we

00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:47,070
asked them where they are and we show

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,559
them all the possible options and we use

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,990
very clear labeling to tell them what to

00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:57,290
do we save tap on the on the option on

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:59,550
the place where you are that's it in use

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,070
it's really important to have like

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,600
really good affordance so if things can

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,300
be pressed make them look like they can

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,960
be pressed these real-world metaphors

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,960
really help people

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,180
understand how to use an interface so

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,170
you know make a button look bigger and

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,180
click here and you know if it looks

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,490
slightly raised like it has shutters and

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,770
it stands out in an otherwise flat

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,680
screen I'm just really suggest the idea

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,450
that people should push it and language

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,520
as well really plays an important part

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:34,030
in guiding people through these

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,040
interfaces it really directly

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,340
communicates that you can click on

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,230
something tell people what to do and

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,950
combining icons with very descriptive

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,030
labeling it's also very helpful so you

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,610
can see like the difference here between

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,700
these two buttons we've become very

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,940
conditioned to accept with some dis

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,830
button on the left as a button this is a

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,170
very kind of popular flat UI style

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,560
button but a lot of people don't have

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,970
this conditioning and to them this this

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,500
button on the right looks like something

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:10,060
that they can they can press on looks

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,760
very very obvious and speaking of

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,280
clicking people will probably click on

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,750
everything just to see what it does and

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,280
particularly in a flat UI pretty much

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,050
everything looks like it could be a

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,400
button so people will press on

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,710
everything to just to see what it does

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,990
so it's generally a good idea to build

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,310
in some sort of them undo actions or

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,300
warnings confirmation dialog

00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,970
particularly for destructive actions

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:37,000
like this sir if someone presses on

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:39,130
delete records and give them a very

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,170
clear idea of what will happen given an

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:45,250
option to go back animation is actually

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,510
really interesting because I can go

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:52,690
either way sometimes they can really

00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,950
like hinder a user's actions so

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,940
especially when it comes to inputting

00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:01,360
data or completing tasks this is an

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:05,110
example of like a UI material you I form

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,810
element which is very commonly used on

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,610
Android now and it has some really

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,070
fantastic documentation on how to use

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,400
motion and animation to show how an app

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:17,779
is organized and what it does but it

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,349
really fails when it comes to to

00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:23,389
a form inputs so this kind of these

00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,489
circus animations really in their way

00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:28,039
hint at what should happen when you

00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:30,739
complete this gesture it doesn't depict

00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,559
the natural movement you know inspired

00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,909
by forces in the real world this is you

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,989
know certainly know what happens when I

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:40,429
use a pen and paper and where animation

00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:43,070
is actually really shine is where they

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,840
describe like a spatial model where they

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:55,969
tell the user if they're going forwards

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:59,149
or backwards are up or down so this for

00:21:55,969 --> 00:22:02,210
example is like just a static kind of

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:06,679
transition between two screens you hit

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,879
continue any greater the next one it's

00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,649
something that actually really helps

00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,989
people understand where they are in an

00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:13,849
app is just a very simple like

00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:20,089
transition element like so they're going

00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:23,809
left or right consistency is really

00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:25,279
really important if you have you I and

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,809
navigation elements that are generally

00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,609
in the same place and act the same way

00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:30,440
then they're going to really help people

00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:33,019
just learn how to use your app by

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,409
memorizing it and in this way even

00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:38,109
people who are not very literate maybe

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:41,269
not literate all a very low literacy

00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:43,190
they can often use these apps just by

00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,589
rote memorization of where things are

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,869
and how they work so if you use a

00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:50,629
forwards and backwards pattern here I

00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:52,279
get the bottom forward and back then

00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:54,559
don't disturb that pattern in a

00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:59,690
different place by printing a back

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,749
action somewhere else and don't be

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,089
afraid to inject a little bit of fun we

00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:09,289
I mean I wouldn't go so far to call this

00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:10,429
gamification exactly but giving you the

00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,269
sense that they're achieving something

00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:15,559
that they're making progress is you can

00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:17,899
really have a little bit of fun there I

00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,969
think you know when we're asking people

00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:23,239
to register the details of like

00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:24,499
thousands of people some sense that

00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:28,460
they're that they're getting somewhere

00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:30,710
with that is really really helpful

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,670
and if you're ever in doubt III no way

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,970
steel or bar there are certain apps that

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,350
pretty much everyone in Africa is using

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,980
there's no surprises here the on

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:46,190
Facebook and whatsapp in gmail so if

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,440
you're in doubt you can look at these at

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:52,250
these ups and look at the navigation and

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,860
the UI patents that they use and emulate

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:58,390
them so nearly every health worker that

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,070
we provided with a phone or a tablet

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,040
they either immediately or eventually

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,060
proceeded to download whatsapp and gmail

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,910
and facebook and Facebook really knows

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,050
that this room sort of where it's at

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,660
they know that this is where the next

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,910
billion users in the world their

00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,300
messenger app already has over billion

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,280
users and their messenger light which is

00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,220
the lightweight version but uses less

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,510
daughter and sucks up less battery life

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:31,280
this they're really aiming for the next

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:34,040
billion with this so the projects that

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,020
I've shown you today they're in a very

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,150
much of public health context but the

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,510
lessons from this are not limited to

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,150
that context if is really where the next

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,610
billion users are these emerging

00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:50,360
economies presented huge opportunity and

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,890
huge new audiences and I mean like

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,320
everyone else in the world African

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,150
consumers are very demanding and

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,990
informed once they become familiar with

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,940
the technology and despite being

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,250
relative newcomers to this kind of

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,260
digital technology they they want the

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:11,110
same things they weren't clear reliable

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:14,150
very smooth running mobile solutions and

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,490
the things that matter to us here Turing

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,710
year in Europe and the US these same

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,900
things matter to the people in Africa as

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,540
well they just have to be much more

00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,770
creative about how they access it so

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,940
they want to communicate they want to

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,520
connect they want to listen to music

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,620
they want to take photos I've never

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,130
taken so many selfies as when I've been

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,130
in Africa

00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,810
and these resource constrained

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,640
environments as they're called they can

00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,010
teach us a lot as designers in the

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,990
sneakers they teach us to strip back

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,360
everything to what is really really

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:51,120
essential they teach us to know where

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,760
users and to try and make things that

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,380
are really useful to them things that

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,920
you want down to ever use and t able to

00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,880
enjoy and not what you think is

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,890
beautiful or cool or shiny and you don't

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,960
have to go to Nigeria or to give me out

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,260
of the Congo to discover this or for it

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,540
to be useful to you these are just the

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,420
basic principles of good design to have

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,390
empathy to have curiosity this is just a

00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,680
very exacerbated context here but we're

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,500
all human and we all want the same

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,500
things thank you for listening

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,320
