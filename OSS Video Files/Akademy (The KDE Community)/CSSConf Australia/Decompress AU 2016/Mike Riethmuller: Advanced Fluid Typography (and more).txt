thank you

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:16,190
see if we can get this up okay yes so

00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,700
sorry about that there we go

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,470
all right so yes I'm Mike I've got I've

00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,090
just spent the last sort of eight months

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,220
traveling around Europe and hiking

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,630
places and these are some of the photos

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,160
I've taken I've put those on my title

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,010
slides it's nothing to do with my talk

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,080
it's purely self-indulgent they wouldn't

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:37,309
let me do a talk about travel so enjoy

00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:41,090
those the title of my talk is advanced

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,890
fluid typography and more and hang on a

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:50,840
second we've got my slides up because my

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:52,969
notes and I put a little um and more

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,079
there because a lot of the techniques

00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,559
that I'm talking about they relate to

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,760
more than just typography and more

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,399
importantly the broader concepts that

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,710
I'm talking about can be used anywhere

00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,810
in what design is a way of thinking and

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,100
I want you to pay special attention to

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,690
that theme and that way of thinking

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,560
because it's something that I want to

00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,920
discuss with you

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,439
and that is that theme I'm not going to

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,330
make it difficult for you I'm going to

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,729
be talking about an alternative approach

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,409
to responsive design and I'm gonna ask

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,689
you to maybe think about putting media

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,009
queries and breakpoints largely aside

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,960
and thinking about other techniques

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,000
things like viewport units calculations

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,890
and what they can do as a way of

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,270
implementing some responsive design

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,259
patterns now although we all like to

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,600
think that we live in this wonderful

00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:41,630
post pixel utopia the truth is we all

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,640
very much think in pixels in fact it's a

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,229
widely known secret that all the unit

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,060
types we regularly use a just an

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,990
abstraction of a base font size and we

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,180
usually know this to be 16 pixels so

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,790
we've never really given up complete

00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,170
control it's not a difficult calculation

00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,880
to work out what the pixel size of

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,220
something on the screen is going to be

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,220
and the chances are you do this whether

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,110
you do it knowingly or just intuitively

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,299
have an idea of what the pixel size on

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,390
the screen is the chances are you are

00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:13,670
doing that but of course who doesn't

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,290
love correcting someone on the internet

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,690
and this is literally the internet live

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,290
at the moment we're streaming this right

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,489
so if you have a look around in the

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,410
people next to you if you see someone

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,930
with a smug smile on their face the

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,670
chances are they're thinking will

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,349
actually mic a percentage with is

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,040
relative to the parent element not the

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:38,269
not the base font size and okay fair

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,739
enough very clever Melbourne you got me

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:43,050
but the truth is when this happens we

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,500
try to control it with media queries

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,450
containers grids layout systems and more

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,420
to make sure that our responsive

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,299
components play safe within our pixel

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,069
boundaries and of course this panda is a

00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,810
metaphor for a responsive component

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:01,500
trying to break free of the systems and

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,840
limitations we've put around him and is

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,739
that a stretch of a metaphor it

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,030
absolutely is

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,959
but I think that you'll agree it was

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,069
worth it to get this guy on a slide so

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,580
the point that I'm not getting at is

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,830
that whilst percentages might change 20%

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,610
is always 20% right whether it's on a

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,590
smart phone I'm over here whether it's

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,120
on a smart phone or a desktop 20% is

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,730
always 20% so we've come to accept that

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,140
this is how it is on the web and I think

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,420
that when we get to this way of thinking

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,790
we can become close to new ways of

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,989
thinking and fail to see better options

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,790
we just accept that that's how it is

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:44,280
and so those limitations may have shaped

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,049
our thinking I don't know if you've seen

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,910
this before but if you draw a circle on

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,280
a grant on the ground a cat has the

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,190
tendency to want to come and sit inside

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,810
it and I think that as web designers and

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,989
developers we do this as well we draw

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,109
our own circles and we sit in them and

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,970
it's not that uncommon in the early days

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,150
of like computer animation video games

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,310
and film and things a lot of what they

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,500
did was borrowing from the mediums that

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,389
came before them so I've been told that

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,950
like early television was a lot of

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,720
people describing the set that they were

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,729
standing on because that's what they

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,410
would have done on the radio and you can

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,600
do this on a broad level or you can do

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,070
this with specific technologies and I

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,970
think that we do tend to do some of this

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,979
on the web as well but what if these are

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,419
perceived limitations what if we could

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,330
have something that say starts off at

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,389
20% honest

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,509
screen and fluidly transitions to 50% on

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,819
a large screen like this well the fact

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,530
is we can do this this example was

00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,900
recorded in a browser and it's not a

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,639
hundred and fifty breakpoints it's a

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,370
real fluid transition it's achieved with

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,719
calc and viewport units and I'm going to

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,699
show you how you can do some things like

00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:54,340
this as well as other techniques for

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,810
achieving minimax font sizes fluid

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,270
modular scale headings and a few other

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,150
tricks the first let's take a look at

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,219
existing responsive typography and I

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,840
think it's fair to say that existing

00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,509
responsive typography techniques are not

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,069
ideal now the problem that I have with

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,289
examples like this is that they're

00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,599
clunky they require multiple media

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:15,129
queries and they don't necessarily scale

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,169
in relation to anything else on the page

00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,610
so like our panda they can trigger

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:23,110
overflow jump out of containers and

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,159
things like that why we've persisted

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,080
with these methods for as long as we

00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,150
have I'm not sure not when there's

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,840
better options so if you put unit scale

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,569
fluidly but as you can see they're not

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,590
without their own limitations now that

00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,009
they're really well supported as well

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,120
they've in fact ie9 was an early mover

00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,590
on this so you can get them all the way

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,889
back to IE 9 they're quite easy to

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,050
understand as well but yes there are

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,569
some limitations when you get down to

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,659
small screen sizes you can barely read

00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:57,069
that right but again these these are

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,599
perceived limitations so we can get a

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,430
minimum font size with calc right we

00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,319
just say 18 pixels plus 3 viewport

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,419
widths this means that at a viewport

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,000
width of 0 the font size is going to be

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:09,310
exactly 18 pixels and from there it will

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,729
scale at the same rate it's three

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,560
viewport widths now more often than not

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,879
we might want to font size that stop

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,370
scaling at a viewport with other than

00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,770
zero and of course we can do this with

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,440
media queries so here I've set a font

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,259
size of 18 pixels and then above 600

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,690
pixel media query I said set the font

00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:31,150
size to 3 viewport widths and if we do

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,279
the calculations right we can work out

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,710
the exact point where through your wits

00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,810
equals 18 pixels so that there's no jump

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,469
between a fixed and a fluid value and it

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,330
works like this

00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:41,740
it's the font size divided by the number

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,469
of your port units divided by a hundred

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,770
so 18 divided by 3 divided by 100 gives

00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:47,349
you

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,919
six-hundred and that's where our media

00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:52,150
query was and if you've been paying

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,710
attention you will have worked out that

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,340
hey I can do that for maximum font size

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,289
as well so here's another example three

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,229
viewport whit's fluid and then above a

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:04,840
certain size we've done we've chosen 24

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:07,300
as a maximum so we did 24 divided by 3

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,479
divided by 100 and that gives us our 800

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,789
pixels there so when I'm doing this I'd

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,039
like to look at a reference like this to

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,479
get an idea of have a different viewport

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,190
unit scale across different screen sizes

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,139
and those of you that have been

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,380
listening intently will be going well

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,909
there's still limitations right

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,000
essentially we can find a one column of

00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:29,830
this table if I wanted a font size that

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,080
started off at say 10 pixels of better

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,690
500 pixel viewport width and then scale

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,699
up to 24 pixels at an 800 pixel viewport

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,849
width I couldn't do that

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:43,270
not without a breakpoint and as well as

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,889
that we were calculating as where those

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,669
media queries should be right not not

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:51,190
choosing them so every medium has these

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,150
limitations and sometimes it's hard to

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,009
know when things are perceived

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,729
limitations it turns out that this one

00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:59,020
too is a perceived limitation if you

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,849
point units in calc you can have des POG

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,080
Rafi that scales between specific pixel

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:06,250
values over a specific viewport range it

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,250
looks something like this

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,110
and I know that looks a little scary but

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,120
quite simply it's a function wherever

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,400
you put units of the variable this takes

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,620
a value within a range and applies that

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,830
value to a new range so if I had a range

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,270
of 1 to 100 and a value of 50 and then I

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,630
applied this to a new range between 1

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,710
and 200 my new value would be 100 both

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,639
of those are right in the middle of

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,229
those respective ranges the thing here

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,039
is I'm doing it with viewport width and

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:39,300
font sizes now functions can be

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:43,659
simplified that doesn't look so scary

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,339
and this is what it looks like so as you

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,290
can see as you go down the font scales

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,709
get still minimum size and it stops

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:54,130
scaling and the same on the way up so

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:56,860
there's the font stop scaling now that's

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,940
pretty handy right but what else can we

00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,760
do with that

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,230
so sometimes you might want to

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,390
selectively turn this on and off and

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,790
what I typically do is I apply that

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,830
calculation to the route am the HTML

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,270
element or the root element and then I

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,040
just use our EMS throughout my design I

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,910
don't want lots of those calculations or

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,060
through my style sheets because

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,430
maintainability is important too so if

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,220
I'm doing that and I want to turn it off

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,110
I can put a fixed font size on a

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,390
container and then use am's inside that

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,830
container I can of course do the reverse

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:31,390
too so this is what that looks like

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,160
so as you can see I've got this little

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,520
block off to the side here it might be

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,680
like a caption or some kind of a side to

00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,000
an article piece it's not the best

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,310
design thing I'm sure you can do better

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,190
than that but I hope that that shows an

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,690
example of what I'm getting at and I

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,020
don't think we see much of this kind of

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,120
thing because if you're using

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:56,560
breakpoints it's not that easy to do

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,780
that type of thing so there are a few of

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,790
you feeling like this Mike this is

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,080
confusing I want to use fluid typography

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,740
but I don't want to have to remember

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,050
stuff and that's fair enough right so

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,670
let's just forget all of that and use

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,110
sass right so cheating with sass and of

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,930
course it's not cheating this is this is

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,970
how I do it as well you can create a

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,560
mixin that will generate that equation

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,420
for you as well as the media queries

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,490
that you might need and you just set a

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,590
minimum font size a maximum font size a

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,820
minimum screen size and a maximum screen

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,380
size and you punch them into some kind

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,330
of mixing I haven't shown the mixing

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,130
code there because it doesn't really

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,420
matter there's lots of them out there if

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,300
you google for them you'll find like

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,430
less sass stylist post CSS whatever you

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,250
want if you can't find any of them feel

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,310
free to hit me up on Twitter or find my

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:49,900
blog it's made by Mike there's examples

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:53,020
up there so what else can we do with

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:56,410
this fluid module scales how many people

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:59,260
know what a modular scale is not at

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,530
about half I would say so

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,510
I think it's best described visually

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:07,780
each of the headings here is 1.2 times

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,920
the size of the previous heading that

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,750
means that as they get larger their

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,569
variation in size also gets larger

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,209
and typically when I'm designing or

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:19,459
setting typography I like to find a

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,939
scale that works well for mobile devices

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,290
and a scale that works well for desktop

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:26,569
Wow on desktop I think it looks better

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,920
to have more variation and on mobile I

00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:33,740
like to have a more uniform scale so how

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,379
do I do that well calculating a modular

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,029
scale is really easy but this is a

00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:43,009
15-minute talk and we don't have time

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:45,829
for that so go to type scale com choose

00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:48,649
a size for small screen and choose a

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:50,269
size for large screens copy all of those

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,250
values and you can easily change those

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,879
values to our EMS pixels or whatever you

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:58,850
want to do and then copy them into the

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,589
mix in like this where the value from

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,259
one scale is your minimum value for one

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,610
heading and the maximum value is the

00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,019
other value that goes into the mix in

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,970
there and you do that for each heading

00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:10,970
level or each element that you want on

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:15,199
your modular scale and the result looks

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,110
something like this so as you can see it

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,449
transitions to a more uniform scale and

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,059
then as you go up it's more are varied

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,319
and I don't know about you but headings

00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,879
have always been the thing that I've had

00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:28,189
the most trouble with when setting

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,139
typography and this particular technique

00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:33,379
just solved so many things for me I'm

00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:35,149
not saying L solve all problems but it's

00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:36,829
really nice to just put in and see it

00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,009
sort of work and be right on every

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:41,660
screen size but of course it's not just

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,800
DePauw graffiti you can do this with

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,720
right so who hasn't struggled to the

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,009
perfect implementation of a responsive

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,629
banana so this isn't just font sizes

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,629
again this is scaling the width and

00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,939
height attributes of an SVG they're both

00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:01,879
length values right so I just want to

00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:03,769
show that you can do that here's another

00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,620
example where I've implemented a fluid

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:08,230
vertical rhythm so you don't have throw

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,250
out everything you know about design

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,949
baseline grids vertical rhythm those

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,990
things will work I've written a little

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:17,629
bit about this some other people have

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,649
written about this as well you'll if you

00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:20,059
search for that you'll find those

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,679
implementations you just need to think a

00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:23,929
little bit differently to maybe what

00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,920
you're used to and maybe give up a

00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,870
smidgen of that control

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:32,060
pixels this is another example again

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,470
it's not the best design but there's a

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,660
lot going on here that's interesting

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,180
the images are transitioning between a

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,540
one-to-one ratio and a 16 by 9 ratio so

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,180
square and rectangle the spacing around

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,130
the boxes is changing relative to the

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,949
available space in the viewport as well

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,420
as inside those boxes so sort of they're

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,370
spreading apart as well as sort of

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,899
spacing themselves out and there's

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,470
always like a tight instagrammy type

00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,779
layout on mobile and a more airy

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,850
scrapbook II type thing on desktop and

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,339
again it's not perhaps the best design

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,589
but I can't think of any other way you

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:09,110
could do this currently with the sort of

00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:11,240
layout techniques that we have so I find

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,870
that interesting and I'm wondering what

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,980
other people can do with it as well so

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,949
we've looked at some things that we can

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:22,910
do today with this but what about the

00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:27,199
future of fluid typography has anyone

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:30,470
seen this before no so this is an

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,529
example by Eric van Blokland of a new

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,600
font format or a variable fonts and what

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:39,500
this will allow is for font designers to

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,779
specify limits of how bold how italic as

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,820
well as other custom axes that we might

00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:48,709
not have even thought of so as designers

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,170
developers will be able to choose any

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:53,920
value without downloading multiple font

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,920
files as you would have to at the moment

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,180
so as well as saving multiple font files

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,690
from having to be downloaded we could be

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,949
able to interpolate these values right

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,540
there's an excellent article on all this

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:11,029
depart by andrew johnson that talks

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,579
about live font interpolation on the web

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:16,160
and in this he touches on the problem

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,810
that i've been describing today of sort

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,139
of a cause of bending points in design

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,180
rather than breakpoints and i think that

00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,130
either side of a breakpoint typically

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,190
the design is sort of already burdened

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,930
by the thing that was putting pressure

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,240
on us saying that we needed to have a

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,339
breakpoint there so often I find that

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,540
like it's not ideal either side of the

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,760
breakpoint it's kind of a compromise

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,220
point really isn't it

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,630
and I also think that it's important to

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,760
remember the media queries have been

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,710
around longer than responsive design

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,720
they're kind of a response both to a

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,630
user need as well as a response to the

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,730
technology that was available if we were

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,370
to do this today and look at responsive

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,440
to design free of like those past

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,170
perceptions and perceived limitations

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,000
what would we develop as the there's the

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:07,100
right tool for implementing responsive

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,410
websites and that's why I'm proposing

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,420
that we need a native interpolation

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,370
function in CSS

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,660
now if you've used the interpolation in

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,390
animation you'll know that we have

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,830
animation timing functions cubic béziers

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,860
and things like this that allow us to

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,060
sort of these values in all of the

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,180
techniques that I've been talking about

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,570
today relate to length values in CSS

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,100
pixels REM s all of that kind of thing

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,290
but there are also other values and and

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,440
what I'm worried about with with the

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,910
variable fonts is that a lot of those

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,580
values aren't pixel values or length

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,670
values that they're unitless values and

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,840
these techniques won't work with that so

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,490
I think it's really important that we

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,940
start talking about getting something

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:55,040
like this and that's why I've proposed

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,750
an issue on the w3c github page and I'd

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,280
like to encourage you all to go and have

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,200
a look at that or even just talk to me

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,880
about it if you have any ideas and

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,560
contribute to that discussion because I

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,820
feel like at the moment if we don't sort

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,580
of get this right we'll get these new

00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,200
tools but will still be constrained by

00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,630
past limitations past perceptions and

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,180
those kind of things so I want to

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,920
encourage you all to do that and in

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,930
general on the theme of what I've been

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,810
talking about today I want to encourage

00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,690
you all to get out there and I go forth

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,940
and explore strange new worlds today

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,800
we've looked at then explored the sort

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,930
of limitations of fluid typography but

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,310
this is just one small area of the web

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,230
right and if you're free of your past

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,690
sort of perceptions and you perceive

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,340
limitations then you can go and find

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,360
sort of new territory anywhere on the

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,390
web I don't think there's been a better

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,980
time for doing this then now and most

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,020
importantly with new typography and

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,640
layout features coming soon I think

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,740
there's an obligation to go and do this

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,500
and to adjust your ways of thinking so

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,330
that you're ready to take

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,420
advantage of the opportunities that are

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,740
coming today and that's what I want to

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:02,990
leave you with thank you very much

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,990
[Applause]

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,930
