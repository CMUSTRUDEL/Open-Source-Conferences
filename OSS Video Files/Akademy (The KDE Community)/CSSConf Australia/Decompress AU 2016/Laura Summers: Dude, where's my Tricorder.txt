thanks kid hey guys I'm Laura I'm a

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,840
designer and front-end developer I'm

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,240
currently working in a startup called

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,160
clover which is FinTech previously I

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,529
spent two years any startup that was in

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,770
the medical space and that's sort of

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,489
where this top comes from so basically

00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm here to ask you guys dude where is

00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,939
my tricorder and there's a little

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,349
disclaimer that there's actually several

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,910
tricorders out on the market right now

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,430
but they all suck in there just gimmicks

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,809
so just quietly yeah I know there are

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,820
actually things but they're not the real

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,980
thing they're not than magic look you

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,150
have tuberculosis and you need this so

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,430
yeah so let's talk about tech as a whole

00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,730
right now we're in this weird space

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,660
where some verticals are going like wild

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,940
be fast and others seem stuck in the

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,300
past now this lady has got over the

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,670
radio pager if you can see that and like

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,009
essentially radio paging is from the 50s

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,140
it's one way it's not encrypted it's

00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:10,229
just terrible little character box UI

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,979
interface is that my earrings and take

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,510
them out god that's awful sorry let's

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,780
just do one and I'm like totally about

00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:23,880
us so yeah like hospitals there's lots

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,760
of other verticals like education

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,180
government I'm sure you have many in

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,560
your brains that that are slow to adopt

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,790
a pace of change that we're seeing in

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,880
other spaces so whose fault is this well

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,190
I'm here to say it's big and it's

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,860
complex and its new any person's fault

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,060
but there is a ton a ton of literature

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,440
on the web I'm going to share these

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,600
flights after so if you want to read any

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,970
of these links there is an enormous

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,189
amount of introspective nasal gave him

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,170
like technology blogs and articles that

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,150
are like Oh Silicon Valley why you so

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,200
stuck why engineers make stupid products

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,150
well okay yes it's hard so I'm going to

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
say I think it's not a get blame thing

00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,700
it's no one person fault it's big

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,090
systems and to be fair hard problems are

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,640
hard right like if we are trying to

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,530
tackle

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,940
complicated convoluted system it's very

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,380
hard even to look at it and break it

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,500
down to a small piece and go well this

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,260
is the thing I can tackle also it's a

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,600
business model problem so investors like

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,550
a scope that's small and contained and

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,170
they like business models they

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,610
understand and that's retail

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,950
traditionally right like that's that

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,250
things that they've seen succeed like

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,320
uber and Airbnb so what we have to do is

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,620
not just disrupt an enterprise but

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,110
disrupted business model so let's think

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,459
about how we can do that so if this is

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,170
the thing that's been on your mind if

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,120
you actually want to tackle this I'll

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,920
put it to you that technology will be

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,080
probably like the smallest part of your

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,570
job and the bigger part will be

00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,820
fostering that culture of change both

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,239
from the business model and VC point of

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,560
view and inside the enterprise and it

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,530
helps see if you know what you're up

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,440
against so here it is my little thesis

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,080
for 15 minutes if survival guides for

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,000
bringing technological disruption to the

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,380
enterprise it's going to leave that

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,790
there for a moment because this is my

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,470
project moment to card being amazing so

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,570
i'm going to i'm going to show you this

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,780
through the lens of hospitals but i

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,209
think again it's important why this is

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,760
important is because the problems we're

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,310
seeing in the world like economic

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,769
problems the rice is capital the decline

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,150
of the middle class the wildly broken

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:40,769
political systems were living inside

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,690
like our inability to tackle climate

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,579
change all that stuff these are all

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,160
problems that are bound up in big

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,049
convoluted we get a string systems and

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,910
it's our job to like think about how we

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,280
might potentially tackle even a very

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,900
very small part of this problems so

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,459
here's the first first challenge you

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,280
might come up against in the enterprise

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,690
space it is the tender process now if

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,860
you've done this before you're going

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,510
about to know what I'm going to say

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,090
which is that they're terrible their

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,940
long their time and resource intensive

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,890
for the vendors they're often written to

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,780
actually like pick an existing vendor

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,340
and like cut everybody else out so that

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,660
means that if you weren't on the radar

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,660
before they wrote the tender it's

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,160
terrible they often have really onerous

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,239
requirements so if you're a small

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,950
start-up and you've only been in

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,510
business for a short period of time it's

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,510
basically saying yeah we're not

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,670
the new shoe that's not great if you've

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,190
ever been to experience it might feel a

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,410
bit like oh hey I'm here to like see

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,570
lots of vibe have a first date maybe

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,610
like have a drink chat see if we like

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,710
have things in common we have problems

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,700
going to solve together and then the

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:48,840
tender is like ya know you're gonna be

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,670
having my baby so and again my favorite

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,410
this is just an excuse rich people start

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,310
check rips oh yeah that's what's going

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,680
on so they made you a lot of

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,630
prescriptive describing of what you need

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,400
to supply and that's just the wrong way

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,930
to think about things they should be

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,970
telling you what the problems are that

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,790
they're trying to solve and then let you

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,920
the actual like experts think hard about

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,740
what technology solutions might solve

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,260
those problems so a lot of trying to fix

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,210
this space is telling people how and why

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,360
tenders are inefficient and poorly

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,330
designed so there's a lot of things you

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,040
can try and do to make tenders better

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,340
before we can kick them out the door all

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,080
together while you're still in the

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,610
tendering process you definitely want to

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,440
network you want to get in front of the

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,380
vent that rather the clients before they

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,480
even write it there are ways to deal

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,070
with the onerous requirements for small

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,200
business if for instance partnering with

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,460
a big company like in the health space

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,930
there's someone like Telstra health

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,580
there's lots of big companies that are

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,530
basically look like really quite happy

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,020
to put their umbrella so that they can

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,850
take the glory of being included in this

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,090
small start-up like innovation community

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,760
so it is worth thinking if that's a good

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,020
solution for you you can also try and

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,700
figure out if they have a purchasing

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,530
budget which doesn't have a threshold

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,330
requirement sorry a tendering

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,820
requirement because if you can sneak and

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,110
underneath that threshold then you might

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,310
be able to get your foot in the door and

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,690
then when they look for the next big

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,560
project you're like already on their

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,180
radar so and also we just need to tell

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,460
them that these processes are terrible

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,110
and why and what kinds of outcomes will

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,000
be preventing themselves from achieving

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,340
which is the technology they couldn't

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,740
even think about contender for write the

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,190
solution they didn't even know existed

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,480
um the next problem flash challenge /

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,729
the opportunity I want to talk about is

00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,370
a sale cycle

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,779
the bowling here is basically a long and

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,969
interesting read if you're interested in

00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,699
the hospital space it basically talks

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,860
about how hospital admins make

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,529
technology purchasing decisions what are

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,330
the triggers to get them there and it's

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:53,249
just a lot of terrible things basically

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,080
like patient deaths and stuff like that

00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:56,460
which is a thing that they never wanted

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,319
to say they always say ooh adverse

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,029
outcome but what that means if someone

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,930
died because something stupid happened

00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:05,460
so it's that's very representative of

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,809
what happens in enterprise I think like

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,189
they're very reactive they wait for

00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:10,020
something terrible to go around them in

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:13,649
the glue maybe we don't have the

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,199
solution so in terms of the sales cycle

00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,999
it can be six months it can be two years

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,039
it's very long this is very hard for

00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,080
startups to survive so if you're going

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,879
to try and tackle the space be aware

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,770
that it's going to be along and you need

00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,309
to have capital to survive that period

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,360
of time so yes don't go into this like

00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:33,180
naively it's really important that you

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,210
think what can I do to survive that time

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,469
that cell cycle length there's often a

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,199
lot of stakeholders who have to

00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,939
rubber-stamp the process also in

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,620
enterprise they seem to discover

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,050
technology vendors at trade shows which

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,610
is kind of old school but then we have

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,560
our trade shows as well which is like

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,020
CES and like the cool big ones in the

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,219
States so I don't know I sort of half

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,839
half whether that's a good thing or a

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,539
bad thing versus just finding internet

00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,249
vendors like on the internet but that

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,899
said it's good to know that that's where

00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,129
those relationships additionally formed

00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,209
so that you can be in front of their

00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:08,909
faces so how can we reimagine the cell

00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,680
cycle well I put it to you that there is

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:13,680
a ton of customer acquisition marshals

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,469
and retail that we can steal for

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,689
enterprise so we have to work out how we

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:23,339
can give them potential like deals or

00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:26,159
pricing points that are so appealing

00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,139
they can't refuse so for an example you

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,789
might say hey I'm going to wire up my

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,229
products fully integrate it into your

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,729
systems and you can play with it for

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,319
three months for free or maybe it's a

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,810
year like sometimes they need a long

00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:39,690
time to make a decision another way is

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:43,409
to tie it into a metric to say like hey

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,130
you have wildly inefficient X and we're

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,230
going to see a y % increase in that

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,700
metric by using our tool and if you

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,800
don't see that improvement you don't

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,180
have to pay for it so like there are

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,700
ways of getting around these sales

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,660
cycles and that's being so compelling

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,480
that they can't say no you um this is a

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,970
fun aspect of working in enterprise

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,460
where the person who's using your tool

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,230
is not the person paying for it and in

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,270
fact the person paying for it may never

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,750
actually use it or see it in production

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:18,530
now that's very frustrating because what

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,150
can happen is all the standards customer

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,910
satisfaction success metrics that we

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,230
love to use in retail space don't get

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,290
applied in their thinking when they're

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,900
making purchasing decisions so it

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,510
basically means that whether or not

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,970
users like the tool want to use it and

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,410
find it easy to use don't seem to be at

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,820
the forefront of their minds when

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,250
they're making that technology purchase

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,260
decision so all right that's that's

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,290
pretty frustrating and it also means

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,660
that the people using your school might

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,550
have a little bit of latent frustration

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,430
and anger because they're used to these

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,320
top-down decisions being like saying hey

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,270
here's this new annoying tool you have

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,060
to use you like Oh what do I have to

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,310
learn now so imagine like if your app

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,290
store wasn't you going in and actually

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,570
installing out it was just like hey

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:10,490
today you have to try all this by the

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:12,830
way that's your job so thanks Andy so

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,450
yeah like for sure it can be frustrating

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,820
for people if they're just constantly

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,890
handed top-down decision making so I

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,900
think the way that we solve this is to

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,180
make you just because the next metrics

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,770
part of the deliverable again so I think

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,180
there's a bit of arrogance and there's a

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,220
short sightedness on the point of view

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,110
those decision makers when they don't

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,570
think about how much these errs want to

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,550
use a tool or whether it's got good UX

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,900
or whether it's going to be like an

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,500
improvement in efficiency um a big way

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,090
to have a think about this is I

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,590
enterprise certainly has this phase

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,900
called you a fee which is user

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,450
acceptance testing followed by a user

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,940
training process and these can be like

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,850
literally millions of dollars and months

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,440
long and in like the overall project now

00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,510
if your tool is tarah

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,250
everyone's going to be resistant and

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,810
this is going to take a lot of time and

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,390
a lot of like bullying essentially to

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,970
get people to adopt your school if it's

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,890
really lovely seamless intuitive and the

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,940
adoption is really fast you're just

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,830
going to have all these people on the

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,810
ground writing it out and in fact

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,610
theoretically you shouldn't have to pay

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,890
for that phase at all it should just

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,680
work because people want to use it or

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,870
you get a couple of champions to explain

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,090
whatever more deep or like powerful

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,470
feature sets are there and the basic

00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,580
stuff is already there you can just pick

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:34,760
it up and go this is a phrase coined by

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,740
my wonderful partner Andy and this is

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,020
this is the airport where you have like

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,690
the premium screening line and then

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,770
there's the general screen line and

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,770
essentially this is this weird thing

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,880
where people go through security only if

00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,410
you pay a little bit more money you

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,290
don't have to take your shoes off and

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,700
like it's like how cannot possibly be

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,220
preventing or risk or shaping people's

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,870
lives or preventing a danger if you can

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,060
just pay more money and then not have to

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,860
do it so this is like this weird

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,920
appearances safety that has nothing

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,200
actually do with risk management this

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,980
happened so much mr. price Oh stupid

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,920
earrings take that one off too all right

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:16,060
so the thing to do here is call it like

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,260
you see it so when you see risk

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,540
management processes that are not

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,750
working you just have to shout out and

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,400
we do this really well I'd lean

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,370
methodologies we we think about what's

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,040
the best way to get better and then talk

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,740
about it iterate have a play we're happy

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
to drop tools really frequently a good

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,430
example of house works in hospitals is

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,380
there's a method of risk management

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,630
called the Swiss cheese process which is

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,430
like each layer of risk management is

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,890
like a layer Swiss cheese it's got

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,320
little holes in them and like on its own

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,850
it's not a useful risk management tool

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,080
cause there's lots of holes but they

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,020
have this theory that if you put enough

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,339
layers up then you fill them a little

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,250
holes and you're not going to get

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:01,100
anything fall into the gap and that kind

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,800
of makes sense except it seems that time

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,650
energy is infinite resources that people

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,080
are like completely forever will have

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,850
time and energy to like perform lose

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,519
processes

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,810
obviously it's not true and essentially

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,490
you end up with a stupid swiss cheese

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:22,350
sandwich it's literally too big to take

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:25,600
a bite of so I found this this little

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,850
quote from this lady in fashion and its

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,009
really spoke to me because I feel like

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,600
an enterprise people are very good at

00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,940
sitting in a room and being like oh sure

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,589
you know that sounds reasonable and in

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,990
their heads that going gosh that's just

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,120
ridiculous like you know if you've seen

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,620
the like seven perpendicular red lines

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,170
video you'll know what I'm talking about

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,550
it's like people just nodding along and

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,980
smiling when in fact they're thinking

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,529
this is just ridiculous so I think it's

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,779
our job in the sector to call out when

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,790
we see things that are really outrageous

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:59,680
or inefficient or really just bad

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:02,860
thinking in bad logic um the last

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,949
problem I want to talk about is when you

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:10,120
I complexity is perceived as being

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:13,360
powerful or valuable so this is a bit of

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,910
a cognitive bias that can happen based

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,380
on thinking that more things is better

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,740
essentially but like the more you can

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:25,000
shoot into your interface the better you

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:29,259
are um but when you look at things like

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,120
Hospital EHRs it's very easy to go how

00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:33,670
do we even start right like what's the

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,920
what's the first thing I do on the

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,769
screen and it's just such a mash it's

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,939
actually very reminiscent of Rick's

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:43,149
Rick's design that he showed us earlier

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:45,579
and it's such poor usability design at

00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:48,130
such poor like decision making because

00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:50,380
what they've done is gone hey everything

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,660
you could possibly need ever is going to

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,540
go on the interface here and really what

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,579
good UX is is saying well we're going to

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,670
give you the opinionated defaults about

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,300
some basic features or some common

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,250
functionalities we want you to perform

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,430
and then we're going to hide away all

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,930
that complexity and bring it back if and

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,750
when it's relevant to you so bring it

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:14,380
back in a contextual manner and that is

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,300
really the work of a UX designer like

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,730
they do all that work of thinking hard

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,620
about what all the pieces are and then

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,930
work out when it might be appropriate to

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,110
share that extra feature or that

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,870
extra piece of information to the person

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,910
so again how do we tackle this get your

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,399
UX and product people front and center

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,810
let them rabbit on about it in front of

00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,760
your clients during the sale of psycho

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,260
like actually let them talk about it

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,690
because it's important that we bring

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,760
this thinking outside of retail and into

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,040
other sectors whoo I'm running over so

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm going to keep going so to conclude I

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,510
think we can't have nice things in

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,399
enterprise we just have to fight for

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,990
them and I hope I've convinced you that

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,940
it's important and necessary and that

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,560
obviously we want to go to Mars but also

00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,490
we want to have hospitals that don't

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,810
suck so thank you very much I hope you

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,339
found this talk engaging are you ready

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,800
for my terrible puns help you friend
