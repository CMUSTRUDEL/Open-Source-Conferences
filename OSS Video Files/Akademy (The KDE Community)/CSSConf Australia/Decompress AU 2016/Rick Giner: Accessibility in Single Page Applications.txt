okay can everyone hear me okay brilliant

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,680
if

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,740
the first proper presentation of this

00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,450
morning I'm surprised as so many of you

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,670
I would be down the back to survive some

00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:26,439
awesome workshops but I tries to try and

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:30,489
keep you entertained and as as Mark said

00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,720
I'm very heavily involved in the

00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:35,500
Melbourne community i love the

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,460
development community here I did run but

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,190
conf last weekend it was heaps of fun

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,750
i'm also a co-organizer with the angular

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,580
JS melbourne community without ex

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,460
Brokovich so we're going to see a few

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,270
angular examples as i talk about

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,610
accessibility and single page

00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,900
applications so i'm going to start off

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,140
by setting up to the context about

00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,750
accessibility so this is a quote from

00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,810
tim berners-lee timmy was the inventor

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,350
of the internet the power of the web is

00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:07,930
in its universality accessed by everyone

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,079
regardless of disability is an essential

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,840
aspect now when the internet was

00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,780
conceived it was responsive it was

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,240
accessible by its nature and our first

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,400
for ever more complex web applications

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,200
has kind of broken it a little bit and

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,850
we need to remember and work a little

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,650
bit harder to make sure that our our

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,880
applications and websites are accessible

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,060
for everyone and also the very nature of

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,830
accessibility instead of focusing on the

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,810
technical aspects of accessibility is

00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,270
important to recognize that usability

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,150
it's also an important aspect of

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,100
accessibility now this is really key as

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,830
well because this is the difference

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,360
between meeting minimum accessibility

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,080
requirements and actually building an

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,820
application that is usable right so this

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,619
is this isn't just ticking the boxes and

00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,500
saying I've included an alt tag there

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,570
for my site is my image is accessible

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,450
this is knowing that that alt tag is

00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,390
descriptive and that someone can use the

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,700
application or website you've built so

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,840
in the the remaining 13 and a half

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,510
minutes we're going to try and cover

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,159
quite a lot now a lot of these topics

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,870
are relevant to more than just single

00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,250
page applications but there's there's

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,159
some key things that I want to try and

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,769
bring your attention to that where we

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,520
sometimes break these more than others

00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,390
when we're writing

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,040
our applications so accessibility starts

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,830
with a good design this is my favorite

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,770
design not not because it's good because

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,950
I think it really illustrates the point

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,140
this is a collection of various grids a

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,990
mishmash of shapes and colors images

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,490
links and text for most people that were

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,950
described themselves as not having any

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,680
disabilities this is not very usable

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,990
this is the website equivalent of a bowl

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,510
of Cheerios it's a Jackson Pollock

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,600
without any artistic merit it's a real

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,670
mess is difficult to understand but now

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,430
imagine that you have some form of

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,340
cognitive disability imagine that you're

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,440
trying to use this website with a screen

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,960
reader or access the parts with a

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,840
keyboard this would be impossible for

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,840
most people to use but with a disability

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,750
it really is impossible and although

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,000
this is an extreme example anything that

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,090
is over complicated is also going to be

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
difficult for a lot of users a good test

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,530
is turning off your monitor and trying

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,660
to use the website or the web

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,180
application you've built with a screen

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,940
reader and a keyboard if you can do that

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,620
you have a usable design you have

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,690
something that is probably going to be

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,700
usable for most people and therefore

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,190
it's also likely to be much closer to

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,320
being accessible when you start thinking

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,240
about that you simplify you just show

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,020
the relevant information and that's

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,130
really important for a good design

00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,200
document structure is another aspect

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,570
that covers the whole of the web not

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,520
just single page applications but when

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,040
we deal with dynamic content it's really

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,810
easy to break a document structure we're

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,280
building little modules directive

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,959
snippets whatever they are we're

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,459
throwing them on a page together they

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,920
don't have any awareness of where they

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,570
are and we can put them in any order and

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,419
break what is essentially a good

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,690
document structure if we start with a

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:21,459
good document structure it means that

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,800
when we do start considering

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,960
accessibility screen reader keyboard

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,030
access we can go a lot further than just

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,060
navigating that website using the tab

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:35,620
and arrow keys we have the ability to

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,610
navigate to navigation to headers to

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,069
read out the number of items in a

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,750
if this is all really really helpful for

00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:46,039
someone that can't see the structure of

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:49,689
a page so this is a random website from

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,120
my history it's a buzz comp website and

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:55,969
it has a pretty typical structure it's

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,919
got a logo and navigation along the top

00:04:55,969 --> 00:05:01,159
it's got a heading some content a

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,219
subheading if we look at the actual

00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:07,550
markup we can see that it's semantically

00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:10,699
described it's easy to read we've got a

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,740
head block with a document title within

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,319
the body we have a header it has a

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,629
navigation tag it's got list items

00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,270
inside it we have a main block and it

00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:22,159
has a single h1 attribute and then below

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,270
that it has other headings and other

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:27,979
content this is really key so in a

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,810
single page application we don't call

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,669
the full page refresh when we change to

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,020
another part of the page we just change

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,029
the view so let's do that will change

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,639
the view and we'll go to another part of

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:40,219
this website so this isn't a refresh

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,529
this is just changing the view the same

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:43,879
menu it's just different headings it's

00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,259
got a different document cycle and you

00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,940
probably can't see that but in the tab

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,190
on the top on the browser it's got a

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,810
different document title so a screen

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,789
reader should announce that change

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,060
should announce the change in the title

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,949
resist we're going to a new page and the

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,080
way we can do that is pretty simple now

00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,639
this is an angular example using ng

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,520
route there are lots of different

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,620
examples we have the route defined we

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,500
have the title defined and a bit down

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,919
the bottom when the route has finished

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,120
loading we're just setting that title

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,189
and that's really important as really

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,550
important to give context to two people

00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:21,889
using the page and there's a similar

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,960
example in reacts this is a very very

00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:26,360
small amount of code but it's very very

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:31,370
critical to help preserve that that

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,680
structure a focus is also important

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,150
[Music]

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,339
again across the whole of the web's but

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,979
it's very easy to break focus when you

00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,750
have complex applications we're changing

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,449
the view so that part of the page that

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,130
might have had focus suddenly isn't

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,839
there and because we're not causing a

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,110
refresh a screen reader isn't going to

00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,450
start reading the content

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,700
Samantha cream we might also lose focus

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,190
when we delete an item from a form we

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,440
have or when we closed a modem so we

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,290
need to start be explicit about managing

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,840
our focus we're back to this random

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,120
example we've changed the view again and

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,610
we want people to know that the content

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,980
on the page has changed so we might set

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,970
the focus to the new heading of this

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,510
page and we can do that very very simply

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,100
again I'm going to read from the bottom

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,050
here we start we start down the bottom

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,170
to have a laser rightly so he's starting

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,090
looking at here we are finding our h1

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,150
tag and because our document structure

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:35,280
is correct and valid we only have one h1

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:37,110
tag we find that if it's there we set an

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,240
attribute of tabindex to minus 1 which

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,770
means programmatically we can set focus

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,530
but you couldn't get there by hitting

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,800
the keys and we use JavaScript to set

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,560
the focus to that h1 now at the top we

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,390
also do a little check to make sure that

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,060
we're only doing this if the application

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,710
has history that is to say not when you

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,810
first come to the page because we'll

00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,250
have a full page refresh when you first

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,080
come to the application it will

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,180
automatically start reading from the top

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,460
down but when we change the view we just

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:11,100
want to jump to that h1 and start going

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,570
from there a keyboard accessibility we

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,130
can't really talk about accessibility

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,050
without talking about the keyboard this

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,850
is one of the most fundamental and

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,440
arguably to one of the one of the

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,820
easiest areas to to address but we have

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,160
to be really careful with single page

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,590
applications because we can really screw

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,080
this up so I've got four code examples

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,020
up there we've got some some reacts

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,320
where we have a unclick attribute on a

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,950
div we've got some some ember and some

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,950
backbone where we're attaching submit or

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,810
click actions to headings and unzip down

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,180
the bottom right is angular we've given

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,540
it a class of button and we're attaching

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:55,380
a click attribute to it so what's wrong

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,430
with all of these examples who's got an

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,930
idea

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:05,430
I didn't hear that but I'm going to say

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:07,529
yes we are we are binding interaction

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,770
events to something that should not be

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,990
clickable links and buttons are

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,630
clickable divs and headings and other

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,279
random elements are not this is really

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,110
really important because a screen reader

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,290
is not going to tell you you can click

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,570
these things this is fundamental and so

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,300
important it really makes me sick when

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,070
we get this wrong so I'm going to

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,680
digress for a little moment and talk

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,540
about links and buttons because I've

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,250
said that these are the clickable parts

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,220
but when do you use a link when do you

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,350
use a button they have different

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,070
properties a link you click with the

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:47,130
enter key it has focus hover active link

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,690
and visited pseudo classes and you can

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,060
open it in a new window commonly by

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,730
using a right-click so this can be used

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:58,709
for changing a URL according a browser

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:03,089
redraw a button you click with a space

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:05,850
key it has different pseudo classes it

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,760
has a disabled property it will natively

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,190
submit a form so this is perfect for

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,589
submitting a form opening a modal

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,180
executing a piece of script so when

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,850
you're deciding whether to use links or

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,980
buttons consider this if a screen really

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,640
user tabs on to an interactive element

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,750
what its role tell them what to expect

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,880
they need to know this because if it

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,550
says this is a link they will be hitting

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,900
one key if it's a button they would be

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,170
hitting another key if you're

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,760
suppressing features like the hrs if you

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,400
don't want them to open a page in a new

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,029
browser window consider using a button

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,220
instead of a link these tips came from

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,980
an excellent article by maressa Mary

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:51,000
Sutton I'll put up all of the links

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,880
later on there's lots more tips there so

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,950
here's a couple of examples of a link

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,450
and a button in the first example we've

00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,920
got a link we know it's a link it's got

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,200
a nature if it's going to go somewhere

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,420
it also has a click attribute that's

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,360
fine you can still execute scripts with

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,850
a link and below that we have a button

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,259
it doesn't go anywhere it just performs

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,350
a script in this case

00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:16,229
it's a toggle we've also got some hidden

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,879
text in here and it will show one or

00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:19,769
other piece of text depending on what's

00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,319
happening so it will say hide details

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,669
for this thing or show details for this

00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,249
thing depending on what's what's

00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:28,229
available on the screen now here we

00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,699
could use aria-expanded for those of you

00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,859
that know a little bit about Aria but I

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:34,199
like using visually hidden text in this

00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:36,600
example because the next slide is about

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:39,059
visually hidden text it is really

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,829
important as well we can bring extra

00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,809
information to people that can't see

00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:44,910
what's going on to help give them

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,879
context and a little bit of CSS like

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,529
this will allow us to do it so on this

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,600
page we've got three different

00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:55,049
accommodation options for let's say a

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,809
technical tech technology festival buzz

00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,669
comp or something you may want to buy

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:02,039
one of these accommodation options and

00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:04,079
for those that are able to see the ad

00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,759
buttons are underneath the heading so we

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,799
can see you could add a dorm room or at

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,479
a campsite but if you were to just go

00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,699
between these clickable elements by

00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:18,209
pressing tab a screen reader is going to

00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:19,949
just read our ad ad ad no help at all so

00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:22,350
we need to add something in there and a

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:24,149
bit of hidden text like this where we

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,609
bringing in the accommodation sites are

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,230
into the button will allow people to

00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:30,779
have a bit of context so now those

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:36,029
buttons will be heard to say add a dorm

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:38,129
room Aria stands for the accessible rich

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,949
Internet applications now this is a

00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:42,929
really really useful collection of

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:46,829
properties that screen readers can use

00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:48,179
to enrich the experience and they're

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,720
very important in single page

00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:54,600
applications re alive is a property that

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,329
is often abused but very powerful when

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,299
used correctly and it will announce that

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:03,179
a part of the page has changed so in our

00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:05,369
top example we've got a button and the

00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:08,369
value of that button will either be the

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:10,589
word search or searching depending on

00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:12,509
whether it's clicked and we want that

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,729
change to be read out when you click

00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:17,069
that button when I submit the button

00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:19,980
that says search I want the screen

00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:22,889
reader to announce searching just a

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,120
little a little tweak to give give

00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,910
someone with assistive

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,040
technology's a little bit of context and

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,960
we're giving it the attribute of perlite

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,520
which means that a screen reader will

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,740
wait until it's finished reading the

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,040
current block before it announces this

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,010
next step in the bottom we've got less

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,240
safe and pagination again the aria life

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:48,779
of polite and it will say showing n of X

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,640
but we also added a property aria atomic

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,610
equals true and that means it will read

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,400
out the full content of this element so

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,100
if we are saying showing 1 of 3 and we

00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,230
go to the next page the number one will

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,839
change to a number two but we don't just

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,520
want it to read out to that's no help we

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,529
wanted to read out the whole line so by

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,140
saying this is an atomic element it will

00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:13,020
read out showing 1 of 2 showing two of

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,790
two there's lots of other Aria

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,070
attributes as well and there's libraries

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,410
that will add these in automatically for

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,720
you a couple of examples up there so

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,670
when something is dynamically hidden by

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,770
your single page application it will add

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,480
an attribute of Rea hidden so your

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,570
screen reader knows not to read it for

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,029
form validation it will add aria invalid

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:37,320
for elements that are invalid all really

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,730
really useful stuff build tools is the

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,770
final thing I'm going to talk about I've

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,910
got a massive one minute and 10 seconds

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,500
so we're going to flip through this

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:49,350
pretty quickly there are a few tools out

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,410
there that help our job I'm going to go

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,290
back to the stat here colgrove who wrote

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,910
ten and I owe a fair while ago three or

00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,820
four years ago said the only eighteen

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,200
percent of the work a guidelines for

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,180
accessibility can be tested

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,940
automatically that number is probably

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,620
still fairly accurate we can't use build

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,350
tools to do all of our job for us

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,770
remember this is about usability not

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,720
just about ticking boxes but we can get

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,320
it to help catch developer mistakes and

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,880
tools like acts are great at doing that

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,790
but there are protractor plugins for

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,650
this phantom jayus if you use that again

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,330
there's there's tools that you can use

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,890
the plug-in that will remind you of

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,200
those things that you've missed they

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,320
will save that your image is missing an

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,830
alt tag or your HTML tag is missing a

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,390
language attribute they might tell you

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:45,120
check that this is descriptive and valid

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:47,400
so in conclusion remember to start with

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,280
a considered design and code

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:55,380
semantically that will really help test

00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:57,930
early and continuously embrace Aria but

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,660
try not to rely on it turn off your

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,160
monitor and try to use your application

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,590
it's so easy to get an experience for

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,360
what millions of people in Australia and

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,850
we are talking about million to use

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,530
assistive technology if you just turn

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,790
off your monitor you'll understand what

00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,910
they're going through and hopefully

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:28,100
you'll be able to code better websites

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:31,110
thank you very much aight will be online

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,620
and all the references as well so i'll

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,620
post them later

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,110
