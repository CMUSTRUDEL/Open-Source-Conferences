	00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,679
so let's let's kick off my boss sucks

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,369
that's that's it that's there's

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,390
something deeply inadequate about mobile

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:25,829
Scott Jenson hmm who loves mobile he's

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:30,540
on the Google team and he's really he

00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:33,660
noted in January that mobile still has

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:39,060
so much to learn from desktop user

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,430
experience for mobile where it's a

00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,820
gimmick basically it's we you don't do

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,570
any real work there it's it's just not

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,329
feasible I mean it's not about CSS

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,410
definitely not I mean by the way this is

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,690
the bootstrap CSS and if you were

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,079
wondering what the next media query had

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:06,240
it's again padding right 15 pixels

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:09,420
padding left 15 pixels yeah and I mean

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,909
we solved look we solved it you only

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,350
need that one layout and then that's

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,170
that's it that's Facebook that's

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,880
LinkedIn that's Twitter we're good for

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,610
layout we're done but it's still not

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:28,409
there's still something missing it's

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:31,200
it's just not useable I'm I can't give a

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:36,330
talk with my phone

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:42,180
not yet and as much as me I think this

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:45,600
it's 35% of our time is spent in social

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,260
applications 16% on entertainment and

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,720
that's excluding gaming whereas in terms

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,030
of productivity if you're searching if

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,760
you're researching this is roughly about

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:02,700
10% and it's not just about screen real

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,580
estate it's it's more than that tablet

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,170
has similar numbers if anything tablet

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:14,879
is more prone to these there's about 20%

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,650
in gaming but this this is not about CSS

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,290
it's not about layer you came here for

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,920
device

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:28,689
API yeah cool get started if anyone uh

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:33,909
you know woke up today I guess and there

00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:37,840
was the the Guardian used the vibration

00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:41,310
API for the previous election and it was

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,139
just like a notification like hey

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,650
something's bad happens we lost another

00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:51,489
state and it's just that little thing

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,670
it's it's only supported in about 55

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:57,400
percent of browsers in Australia the

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,989
vibration API and if you consider that

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,409
it's mobile probably looking at maybe

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:08,230
like 30 percent support why bother

00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:11,530
it's I mean the vibration API has been

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,650
there for a while but I never see it the

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,709
only time I do see is when an ad has

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,439
hijacked my my Android phone and starts

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,579
vibrating uncontrollably I've never

00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,229
before that that was the first time I

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:29,199
ever saw it out in the wild and it

00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:32,370
served a useful use case and I want the

00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:36,549
Moke I want the mobile web to be useful

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:40,989
see we have a form right let me click

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,099
Submit oh and oh actually I needed to do

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,569
something else you get that instant

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:49,540
feedback we need to move beyond just

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:54,669
these gimmicks or like just delegating

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,889
the real work to the desktop for example

00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:01,329
there's a geolocation API this is this

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:03,370
is been out for a while the specs it's

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:08,040
older than my development career to be

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:13,449
honest but really what we want to do is

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:17,440
minimize typing because it's not about

00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:20,320
being able to type it's about getting

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,650
the address no one said that we had to

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:28,479
type the address right we need to look

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:30,900
beyond just this hey this is desktop how

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:36,460
do I make it smaller

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:39,460
and why is that I mean this isn't a

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,670
QWERTY typewriter I found out it's

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,740
missing why but I already really liked

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:49,420
it already so I sort of kept it in there

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,400
but QWERTY was invented about almost two

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,270
hundred fifty years ago and it's

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,600
designed for ten fingers right and

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,200
that's what we have from mobile where

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,370
I'm using my thumb does it make sense I

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,990
don't know I I just like playing around

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,640
with these api's but the issue is that I

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,500
don't see them out in the wild and that

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,070
means I can't get to use them if no one

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,800
else is I'll say like device motion

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,540
right this is also been out for a few

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,580
years

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,470
basically it responds it uses the three

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,030
motion sensors the accelerometer the

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:36,130
gyroscope and the magnetometer and

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:39,400
basically it goes hey you moved and is

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,340
it the instant sort of I guess reaction

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,920
is like all cool games like we can you

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,720
know do something interesting but that's

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,650
not the thing save it for you had a form

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,420
and like an etch-a-sketch we just we

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:57,520
just shook it instead you know we we

00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,330
just instead of this we can empty the

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:06,850
form that way and speaking about like

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:10,930
the magnetometer we have the Google

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:16,390
cardboard run for a button it decided

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:21,040
hey what's free and is easily accessible

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:25,810
and basically and it's supported in

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,870
basically every single phone magnets you

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,500
can use magnets as an importance they've

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,240
done this basically it's ingenious this

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,970
is the early edition of the Google

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,060
cardboard and you just flip the switch

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:42,449
and this was your input because you

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,999
can't press the screen you the screen

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,740
doesn't is not available for you as an

00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:50,669
input anymore so you have to get

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,490
creative and it was really ingenious

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:56,279
they've moved on but it's and we have

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,039
these right every pretty much every

00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,699
phone I can imagine for like our

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,949
audience

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:07,469
it would have these rich senses right so

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:11,909
we couldn't this doesn't look like much

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:15,779
but basically this is a ring that's got

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:18,270
a magnet inside it right and the problem

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,360
would say your your you know your

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,889
classic SmartWatch is that as soon as

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,909
you interact with it you can't see it

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:31,289
anymore this one they've used their

00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:33,930
sensing for the magnet and basically in

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,789
each direction that you put it as a

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:40,399
different type of input it's a different

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:46,680
kind of gesture and this is not obvious

00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:49,499
but it's useful and we can do this for

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,830
the mobile web there's we've just gotten

00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:56,569
access by in the latest builds of Chrome

00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:02,459
to these really low-level senses such as

00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:05,580
accessing magnets and the biggest thing

00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:08,060
is I want to move beyond what I love I

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,680
heard this once scrawly telling

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:15,509
scrolling telling is every single

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,990
website that we have when you see a

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:21,330
great great experience on desktop my

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,620
first instinct is to go to mobile and

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,360
it's just it's pathetic honestly it just

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,099
doesn't give me that same like visceral

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,719
feel so there's not even just it's not

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,889
even about being useful anymore it's

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:39,300
just being an experience it's it's not

00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:41,159
something to pass the time and we can

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,899
use something like say yeah the ambient

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,529
light sensor so this is moving beyond

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:50,640
like explicit forms of input such as

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:56,279
your magnets such as touch such as even

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,670
sound this is emphasis maybe maybe we

00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,280
can

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,680
provide a different story a different

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:06,510
experience based on whether they're

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,180
inside or outside maybe it's actually

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,600
useful maybe if it's dark at night you

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,590
don't want to send the same really

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,720
bright thing it's just I don't know I've

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,580
been blinded so many times at night so I

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,960
can imagine as a common use like common

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,490
use case and we could solve that and see

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,930
that this is this this stuff there's

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:34,680
like these kind of bad like privacy

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,720
implications I say really bad but I see

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,370
this right

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,220
Pinsky me exploiting the ambient light

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:45,200
sensor in mobile devices so basically it

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,310
uses the light sensor to determine where

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,070
what you're doing with your fingers

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:54,810
basically and there's a lot of bad cases

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:57,360
out there of this I see this and I'm

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,950
really I'm really inspired I think this

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,970
is imagine you came up with that like

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:08,850
damn you deserve my pin come on like

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,160
it's it's just about we have these

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:15,840
senses and we've had them for a long

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,430
time geolocation the device light has

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,170
been available in Firefox for a long

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,110
time you can play around with it in

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,520
Google Chrome as well if you just go to

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,480
enable experiment to a web features

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,500
where all the fun stuff is anyway and

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:35,460
you could play around with it but I

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:38,520
guess the issue here is you can't

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,940
probably feel Hardware right you can't

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,360
guarantee the same experience across all

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,760
of your devices but that's okay that's

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,360
that's absolutely fine and that's what

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,980
we should be encouraging we never we

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,320
pretended that we knew the screen size

00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,360
we've used screen size as a proxy for

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,020
some of these features like well if it's

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,110
a small viewport they probably have

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:10,430
they're using a touchscreen but that

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,750
might not be the case at all but

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,180
what we're doing is we're trying to

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,490
guarantee these different experiences

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,110
and all the different times of day why

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,360
not give him a magnet and if they have a

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,400
magnet then they can do something a bit

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,890
different they can navigate but

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:34,020
differently this this isn't how you do

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:37,320
api's like there's a bunch of like

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,420
interesting like work being done at the

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,470
moment really in the low-level senses

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,480
thanks to stuff like the virtual reality

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,460
specifications and so the there's

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,450
byproducts of that for just the regular

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:54,810
people that just want low-level senses

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:56,520
but issues yeah but we've had these for

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,330
a long time and no one's using them and

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,350
I just wanted to spark ideas I wanted

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:06,990
you to see this and be like oh well

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:11,370
maybe I could not pin skin but I could

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:16,140
do something else and it's just it's

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:19,770
just reconsidering its what do you need

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:24,480
to do what does your client want what

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:28,380
does your user need not what have we

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,740
done before I want to be able to give

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,650
this talk fire phone without my laptop I

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:39,330
want to I want to be able to do real

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:43,100
work I want real enjoyable experiences

00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,930
on mobile and I think device API is is

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,760
one of the biggest things that as an

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,430
industry we're just not even considering

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,470
at the moment thank you

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,470
