um so I don't know I'm wondering maybe I

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,620
should let them do this talk because

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:14,040
they were with me trying to fix certain

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,500
things about the slides and I think I

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,750
fixed them so well that's basically I

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:24,990
messed everything up even more so I

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:31,230
don't know they don't seem to be too

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:34,070
delighted about the idea so anyway um my

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,620
talk is called transforms and only what

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:42,210
actually it's polyhedra but i thought

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,789
well a lot of people tell me that octa

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,489
thing you did and they don't really

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,559
remember the entire name that so I

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,350
thought polyhedra he's gonna remember

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,809
that Polly what another way of

00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,210
describing them would be something like

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:03,449
solids but solid is too general because

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,970
spheres are also solids cylinders are

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,380
also solid so let's narrow the

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:17,250
definition a bit solids that have only

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:19,860
flat faces so let's see I have no idea

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,250
what I'm going to be talking about I

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,220
initially thought letting you pick from

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,380
I don't know this demo data mode but

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,850
then I thought well the paradox of

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,900
choice is going to screw me over with

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,880
this so I said three options and I

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,619
thought I pink them well except I messed

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,450
up one of them so there are just two

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,960
available which makes things basically

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,200
more easier easier for you so the first

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,750
one is going to be this one which has

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,909
already started so let's pretend you

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,180
don't see the split you don't see this

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,280
fish

00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,780
so it starts something like this it's a

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,180
cube and then this cube explodes into

00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,420
pyramids and please firmance move a bit

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,130
and then they recombined into a shape

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,380
which is called up rhombic dodecahedron

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:17,640
and it has 12 faces each faith is a

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:21,690
rhombus arm and then basically those

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,510
back to what it was before and the next

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:30,989
option would be this one which again has

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:35,430
already started so yeah um pretend you

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,950
don't see it from hunger so this is how

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,319
it starts it's an octahedron it's a

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,290
regular on all the adjourn with eight

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,100
faces and then they get cut from the

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,500
vertices do more and then it results a

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,010
tube octahedron which is the last thing

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,280
and then it expands again to what it was

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:01,040
initially so on which of these tools is

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,040
it going to be this one

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:24,829
this one so who's in favor of one in

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:31,459
favor of two so I guess one scene

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:37,370
noisier does everybody agree okay so one

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:38,930
it is and I knew I should have put

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,810
something like a click confirmation

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,720
because I had no idea of this worked

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,920
actually click the damn thing so we'll

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,720
see first of all we're not going to get

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,299
directly into it we're going to start

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,579
with a short recap of 2d geometry and

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,319
first of all what a polygon it's well

00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,319
it's a closed broken line in the plane

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,530
the number of vertices equals the number

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:09,379
of edges there are only straight lines

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,870
edges there are no arcs nothing curvy

00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,810
there and there are no are three

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,269
successive points on the same line but

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,239
this is just words it's better to draw

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:26,930
lot right so we can have something

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:30,260
simple like this a simple convex polygon

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,280
and then we also have something like

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:37,760
this which is a concave polygon or

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,520
something like this which is a self

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,800
intersecting polygon and a special kind

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:48,620
of self intersecting polygons are these

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,010
you may know this shape this is a star

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,409
polygon which is a bit different from a

00:04:52,010 --> 00:05:02,630
star-shaped polygon which is something

00:04:54,409 --> 00:05:06,020
like this however we are aren't going to

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:10,430
talk about all these things concave self

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:13,849
intersecting nope we're going to deal

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,729
with simpler things so polygons we're

00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:17,830
going to be using rectangles everything

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:22,270
is a rectangle base

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,420
that's what very start from squares same

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,470
width and height parallelograms opposite

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,860
edges are parallel opposite angles are

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:38,790
equal so you're in joints are equal and

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,790
the wallet ones are equal as well and

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,280
Romney aramis is like a parallelogram

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,830
only all its edges are equal not just

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,920
the opposite ones and also its diagonals

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:58,630
are perpendicular and then we're going

00:05:50,920 --> 00:06:02,020
to have triangles more types so on now

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,140
for a short CSS recap what transforms do

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:10,150
two elements well let's take rule here

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:18,460
he has a system of coordinate and if we

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:21,550
apply a transform to him not only does

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,490
the transform rotate also the system of

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,650
coordinates gets rotated and if we apply

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:32,110
something like ask you then gets skewed

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,940
the system of coordinates as well for

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,700
translate we're going to get the same

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:45,400
thing the system of coordinates gets

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:48,730
translated but not with this unit right

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,280
and the translate is really useful

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,920
because we can now put it in between two

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,380
other transforms and in that way we're

00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:01,240
going to be able to move the transform

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:03,550
origin and this is particularly useful

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,700
when we need different transform origins

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,430
for two transforms of the same chain so

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,470
we're going to leave you alone not going

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,380
to torture her any further she might not

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,730
like it and my start acting like a wild

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:22,560
animal or something

00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:25,500
and so this is pretty easy this is a

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,370
rectangle everything is a rectangle

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,730
initial and CSS and if you give it equal

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:44,340
width and height it's a square obviously

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:47,280
and then we just add a transform skew 15

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:51,560
degrees and this is the parallelogram

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:55,140
and since rhombus is zone a

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,230
parallelogram with all edges equal we

00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:07,490
can just give equal width and height and

00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:13,620
we get a rhombus right right nope wrong

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:16,140
at this does this look like a rhombus it

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,360
has equal width and height but it's not

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:23,210
rhombus so this is because of the way

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:28,320
the skew transform works so we have

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:31,350
initially a square and then we change

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,110
the skew angle and as you can see as I

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,580
increase the skew angle the lateral

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,229
edges the ones parallel to the other on

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,890
axis not the one along which we skill

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,200
they get longer and you can also see

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,750
that the y-coordinate of any random

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,940
point inside the original square gets

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:56,250
preserved while the x-coordinate is

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,980
changing and it varies by a value d

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:04,610
which seems to vary with the angle and

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:11,670
it's the same thing for the y-axis right

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:13,980
so on what's happening behind well we're

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:18,540
going to have to go back to a bit of

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,460
trigonometry and there are a few

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,590
relations which are important and

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,880
basically everything all the mods

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:29,230
reduces to this

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,380
so we have one theorem which says that C

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,500
squared equals a squared plus B squared

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,440
so it's basically the edge opposing the

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,090
90-degree angle which shown my dad used

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,910
to tell me when I was little that's the

00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:52,090
angle that boils 90 degrees right and

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:56,890
then we have the of you tubular metric

00:09:52,090 --> 00:10:01,210
functions and the sine of alpha which is

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:06,220
a ever seen and the cosine of alpha

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:09,810
which is being overseen and the tangent

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,310
of alpha which is a overview so

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,000
basically these are all the formulas

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,440
that everything we do system and we

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,490
applied trigonometry for a particular

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,820
skew X so of a skew of angle alpha so

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:30,310
this is the skew angle and we have that

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:34,780
L is on our ledge our edge length before

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:42,180
the skin and M like you see if two lines

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:44,470
up here the title covers it and and

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,170
alpha is the skill angle as I've said

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,770
before and in the highlighted on a right

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:55,650
triangle this one here we have that

00:10:50,770 --> 00:11:00,820
cosine of alpha is going to be L over 2

00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:08,680
over m / 2 and engines of alpha is going

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:12,070
to be this D over L over 2 so on from

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,230
here we can get the relation of the of

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,780
the lateral edge between the lateral

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,510
edge after the skew and and the one

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:23,860
between the skin so this means that if

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:28,150
you want to reduce the lateral edges so

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,010
that they have again the same length as

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,040
they had before the skew which is equal

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:37,900
to the other two edges then we need to

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:43,570
multiply them with cosine of alpha

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:46,810
so this is some exactly what we do here

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:50,500
and I'm not going to use 60 degrees i'm

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,750
going to use but i'm going to these 60

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,450
degrees because the angle is easier and

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,960
we're going to scale along the other

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:03,070
axis as we skewed all along the x-axis

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:08,530
so we scale on the y-axis by cosine of

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:14,140
60 degrees which is point 5 and this one

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:19,090
actually has equal width and height and

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,700
it is a rhombus now let's think how do

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:30,010
we get a triangle well a triangle is

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:35,170
basically half ramos right but first

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:37,810
let's look at a few notions in circle

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,540
circumcircle and more so what isn't in

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,660
circle in circle is a circle inside

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,480
obviously and the circumcircle is the

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,640
circle containing all the vertices so

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,560
the incircle is the one that touches all

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,090
the edges and the circumcircle the one

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,350
that some contains all the vertices and

00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:02,020
you can see that as i increase the

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,110
number of edges they get closer and

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:10,210
closer together until it finally the

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:14,380
polygon approximates a circle so now

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:18,570
let's think something else this is the

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:23,410
inner radius and this is a regular

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:27,130
polygons edge this is the end radius and

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,620
this is the circum radius and in this

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:33,400
highlighted triangle which is bigger

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:39,640
here and everything overlaps we have

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:45,490
that sine of beta over 2 is l over 2 / r

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:50,050
and the tangent theta over 2 is l / to /

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,779
are so from here we can get

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,279
the circumcircle and encircle if we know

00:13:52,779 --> 00:14:02,920
the edge of regular polygon so what

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,750
knowing you on this this beta is on the

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,500
central angle corresponding to an edge

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:11,709
of one a regular polygon and knowing

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,980
these we can go further and see how it

00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:17,829
can get to a triangle so you start with

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,560
the rhombus and then we take a rectangle

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:22,420
with an edge equal to a diagonal of the

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,600
rhombus and then we cut everything

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,430
outside the rhombus and this is how we

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,700
get a triangle their intersection is a

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,370
triangle so how do you do that so we

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,250
start with the rhombus and we take a

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,089
child of the rhombus or before and after

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,279
sku element and let's see initially you

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,589
can see that the transforms of the

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:48,760
parent get applied for the child as well

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:51,399
so we need to undo them and we need to

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:56,220
undo them in reverse order as we apply

00:14:51,399 --> 00:15:06,120
them so we have initially transform is

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:15,300
on scale X 1 over 4 and then it's some

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:25,899
skew y which is minus 45 degrees and

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:34,260
then then we have rotate minus 22.5 1.5

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:40,360
degrees and I busted something here

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:44,770
degrees exactly this doesn't look

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,380
exactly as looking for right the

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:52,560
position of what the rectangle is not

00:15:47,380 --> 00:16:04,720
correct so on what we need to do is

00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:09,029
apply a translate y of not here shifted

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,029
it here

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:23,910
what did I knew now and we have a

00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:31,470
triangle in the upper part but I should

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:40,589
probably translate this is one let's say

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:43,230
by 29-percent why and why so that's more

00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:46,439
visible and another reason for

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,800
translating it by twenty nine percent is

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,720
that the way on I use these transforms I

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,990
use them on elements that are all

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,449
absolutely positioned and centered and

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,610
so they all have initially the same

00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:04,289
transform origin which I don't mess with

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:06,270
so if I translate this down then the

00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,850
transform origin of the parent is going

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,679
to be somewhere here and twenty-nine

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,850
percent means that it's going to be

00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,709
exactly in the center of the incircle or

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,520
circumcircle because they coincide for

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:27,539
an a collateral triangle but this is not

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:29,970
an equilateral triangle on so moving

00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,159
further we can do something more

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,620
interesting like more of a triangle into

00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,340
a hexagon so we start with a triangle

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,710
and then we have a second bigger

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,640
triangle inside and you're thinking

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:47,970
inside this is outside well inside I

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,559
mean inside thinking dumb wise because

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,280
the big triangle is going to be a

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,929
descendant of the smaller triangle and

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:58,200
we scale the second triangle down to

00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:01,409
half and their intersection is a hexagon

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,200
and you can see that the length edge

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:07,710
length of the Sun regular hexagon is

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,240
going to be one third of the triangle

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:18,990
and then we scale it down a bit more and

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:20,410
we get another smaller triangle and to

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:26,140
do this son

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:30,700
thing we first do something like you

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,620
have to scale it twice but this doesn't

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,530
look correct and it didn't look right in

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:41,260
the beginning as well because they ought

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:45,940
to overlap but they don't so on you can

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,460
see that one has the center in the

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,340
middle of the height of the other one so

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,450
we need to translate it a bit and by how

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:59,470
much by half the height and the inner

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,690
radius but in radius is 1 one-third of

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,970
the height so it's going to be one half

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,890
of the height minus one third so that's

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,270
going to be one sixth and four

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:13,900
dimensions of this one it's going to be

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:16,060
about point ninety three months and I

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:22,740
don't actually compute these things I

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,740
use SAS done I wouldn't compute these

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:37,600
southern ice kale right make a double

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:40,900
and then rotate it by 180 degrees right

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,190
and here I have it and then if I scale

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:48,970
it to one I get the hexagon and if I

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:53,650
scale it 2.5 I get the small triangle

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:56,830
inside so on this is how it actually

00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:02,110
works if you turn all these stages in

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:04,000
two keyframes so stuff to remember the

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,820
incircle is the circle inside the

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,100
polygon touching all its edges the

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,680
circum circle is a circle containing all

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,870
the vertices of polygons not all

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,940
polygons can have an incircle or a

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,150
circumcircle for example concave

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,850
polygons don't have an incircle or

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:24,950
circum circle or a rhombus doesn't have

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:28,910
a circum circle or a rectangle doesn't

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:32,360
in circle but all triangles and all

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,520
regular polygons do the central angle

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,150
corresponding to one edge of regular

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:42,290
polygon with n vertices is 360 over N

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:46,790
and we can compute the in Vegas or the

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:49,490
circle radius and the part that there is

00:20:46,790 --> 00:21:01,180
a regular polygon if we know its edge

00:20:49,490 --> 00:21:01,180
length it's that's when you go

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,450
so let's move on to 3d so let's see how

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,860
to build a regular poet but not exactly

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:31,559
those in the background which took too

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:34,770
long a CSS one might easier so we start

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:37,080
with a base which is a regular polygon

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,900
with known edge length it may be a

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,270
triangle a regular triangle or a square

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,820
or a regular pentagon it doesn't really

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,640
matter we also have some ray or lateral

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,410
faces which have at least two edges

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,100
equal they might be equal to the base

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,049
but not necessarily so how do you

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,110
compute the angles of the latter or

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,669
triangle and how they compute the angles

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,250
between the phases because you can see

00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:05,940
the lateral faces are at an angle with

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:10,169
respect to the base well again it

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:14,309
already uses two triangles so we'll take

00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:19,830
this triangle to be the lateral triangle

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:24,690
what you see here in orange and then B

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:29,940
is the base edge length and l is the

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:33,390
lateral edge length and gamma is the top

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,789
angle for the lateral face h is the

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,669
height for the lateral face and then

00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:41,909
we're going to take this half of it this

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:45,450
right triangle here and we'll see it

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:51,510
bigger here and in this is a triangle we

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:56,250
have that sign of gamma over 2 is B over

00:22:51,510 --> 00:23:00,419
2 / l and we can get turn the top angle

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:04,200
from here right and we can also get the

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:09,240
height again it already uses to those

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:12,179
four formulas moving on we have the

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:16,110
pyramid and these are the lateral faces

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:19,650
and the orange line is the height of a

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:22,409
lateral face and this one is the height

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:27,360
of the entire pyramid and this one is

00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:30,000
going to be in radius of the base so on

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,910
this highlighted triangle is this

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,590
here so this is the angle between the

00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:39,720
two faces this is the height of the

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,550
lateral triangle this is the inner

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,350
radius of the base and this is the

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:48,960
height of the pyramid so the base edge

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,360
length we have are the base face in

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,360
radius the pyramid height the lateral

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,480
edge length the lateral face height the

00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:00,420
angle between the two faces and in this

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,920
triangle we can get the angle from the

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:09,030
cosine which is our over H so we can get

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,850
dealt up from there now let's see how he

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,070
made a tube out of pyramids so cube has

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:17,660
six faces so there are going to be six

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:20,850
pyramids so one comes from the bottom

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,860
one from one side one from the top from

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,350
the other side one from the back one

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,740
from the front and this is how you make

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:32,820
a cube out of pyramids so in this cell

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,830
case or how much is the base so our edge

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,710
length well it's obviously going to be

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,920
or equal to the edge of the cube but how

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:44,010
about the lateral edge well let's

00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,280
simplify that this thing and we have

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:50,640
just two pyramids now and let's

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:54,810
highlight a few edges here so you can

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:59,280
see that one edge from here and one edge

00:24:54,810 --> 00:25:01,260
from here for the cubes diagonal so the

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,920
lateral edge of such a pyramid is going

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:08,280
to be half the cubes diagonal but how

00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,460
much is the cubes back well again we use

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,260
a right triangle so the right triangle

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:19,620
is going to be this highlighted one

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:21,810
which is also the one here and the

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:26,970
highlighted triangle at the base this

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:31,440
one is the one highlighted here so one

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:35,730
LC is so the cubes edge and d is the

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,960
cubes own face diagonal and we have the

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:43,160
cube diagonal and we can get to

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,920
of the base from this right triangle and

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:51,870
then we get to the diagonal of the cube

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:53,520
from this other right triangle so on we

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,470
actually found the length of the

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,970
diagonal of the cube so we know the edge

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,880
length so on if we replace the values

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,120
the belt base edge is going to be the

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,000
cube edge the lateral edge and the base

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,370
in radius is going to be half the cube

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,670
edge and the central angle corresponding

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:17,430
to the base edge is going to be 360 over

00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:21,540
how many edges there are four in this

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:24,450
case so 90 degrees and the top angle for

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,250
the lateral face is going to be computed

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,160
with that formula and I didn't actually

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:35,010
computed myself in but it's

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:37,110
approximately 70 point 53 so and the

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:42,200
angle between the other two faces is

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:47,340
going to be 45 degrees so if we actually

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,650
replace this and we on let's see what we

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:57,620
do to the base face well first of all

00:26:49,650 --> 00:27:02,970
William rotated rotate around the x-axis

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:07,110
by 90 degrees hmm not quite right

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,210
because it went somehow backwards so the

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,430
face is up but we want the face to be

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:20,280
done so that's going to be minus 90

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:23,730
degrees and let's make this so the base

00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:28,440
face is simple it's just minus 90

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:31,610
degrees the lateral face we translate it

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,730
forward that means along the z-axis

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:40,890
translate set that's going to be the

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:43,140
inner radius which is half basically so

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:49,320
we brought it forward and I need to

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:56,640
rotate around them the x axis but not on

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:59,640
with an extra a 45 degrees and you'll

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:08,250
probably see it better if it's on the

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:11,160
lateral and this is a rotating by the

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:14,520
central angle corresponding to one face

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:18,030
and it can be in the other side as well

00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:24,090
it's minus 90 or it can be in the back

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:28,230
if it's 118 or minus 180 is exactly the

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:31,950
same thing and doesn't look that

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:34,320
beautiful let's see if we can rotate the

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:39,060
whole thing so that we can see it better

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:42,510
so that would be like a rotate why of

00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:46,140
the entire pyramid and a grain gain is

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:49,440
not going to work the next a but it

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:56,300
doesn't work like this either is that

00:28:49,440 --> 00:29:03,630
right somehow it is and this is some

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:11,690
oops I think I'm cutting out the wrong

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:11,690
slides so on sorry

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:37,580
no there are actually slides missing now

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:48,620
this is funny no they are actually

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:52,160
started no I found it l so on these are

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:54,530
two doors that are moving in 3d under

00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:58,240
the frame is static so let's see what

00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,240
happens if we unlike the frame

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:23,790
oh I'll turn it and what happened to the

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:26,340
doors they look as if I don't know

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,800
somebody smashed something into them and

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,930
flatten them like in cartoons something

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:36,200
heavy falls on a cartoon character and

00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:38,940
has to shake himself to get back and

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,540
basically that's exactly what happens

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:49,370
because there's a CSS property that is

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:52,830
called transform style and this thing

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:56,610
has a default value flat you can see if

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,460
i use flat nothing changes but as those

00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,980
characters shake themselves we can shake

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:08,120
things with something a valley called

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:16,320
reserve 3d and now everything is

00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:19,190
animated in 3d again so on this is what

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,190
we need to do

00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:32,879
here so we had this translate set

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:53,390
and again an extra hey there and rotate

00:31:47,420 --> 00:32:01,100
145 degrees and now we need to have

00:31:53,390 --> 00:32:06,960
transformed star reserved reading and

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:15,480
now it works again it's in 3d again this

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:21,420
one was rotated X minus 90 degrees so on

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:25,740
we got the pyramid but now I lost the

00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:28,800
settings so on let's see what are the

00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,110
animation stages for exploding the cube

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,360
and recombining it so first we have the

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:37,100
pyramids closely packed so they form a

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,930
cube and their y axis point outwards and

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:42,030
then the permits move outwards along

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,090
their own y axis so in the positive

00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:47,400
direction then the pyramids rotate by

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,980
half a full turn around an axis

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,740
perpendicular to their own y axis can be

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,620
the x axis can be the z axis it doesn't

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,140
really matter any access in that plane

00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,030
another y axis point towards the center

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,660
of the cube after we've rotated and lava

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,970
by 180 degrees and now we move them back

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,730
in words by the same distance as before

00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,070
along the y axis and also in the

00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:17,240
positive direction because as I said the

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:17,240
y axis now points inwards so on

00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:28,899
these were all for the other ones so if

00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:33,730
we need done to see how we distribute

00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:39,279
them so for this one we just translate

00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:43,320
why half the cube la edge length and if

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,320
we had there before something like

00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:57,940
rotate 90 degrees it would have been

00:33:50,230 --> 00:34:03,429
here or rotate x 90 degrees it would

00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:06,519
have been here but let's simplify things

00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:11,159
and leave it down and now we can

00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:18,490
increase this distance and it goes

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:20,790
outwards and now we have rotate 180

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,790
degrees

00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:35,940
and now we are going to have translate

00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:46,450
again y axis and it's going to be for em

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:49,240
and it went back and if we make all

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:52,139
these stages if we turn them into

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:57,220
keyframes we get something like this

00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:03,339
right so it was outwards rotates moves

00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:09,819
back inwards so let's see the final

00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:15,460
result for this thing it's going don't

00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:20,140
know so this is going to be the cube

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:27,760
which explodes hand and recombines into

00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:34,510
this shape and then we can have this was

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:40,920
done second one I shown you and it looks

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:43,720
something like this it's truncated and

00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:49,720
the third one which I busted this

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:52,660
morning this one expands it starts from

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,940
a tetrahedron which expands and it gets

00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:59,650
to cube octahedron and then it collapses

00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:02,279
and into another Etra heater and we can

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,279
make explosion

00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,390
remember the shape we got here we can

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,660
take this one and we can make it explode

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,630
as well so it's made out of pyramids

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,799
they explode and then they recombine

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,559
into something that looks like a maze

00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:29,630
you know that thing you can use to break

00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:32,420
somebody's head yeah that thing with

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,400
spikes and I actually felt like using

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,859
something like that for a kid that was

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:46,279
behind me on the plane yesterday because

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:50,660
he gets screaming in soon another

00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:54,980
example we take a cube and then we

00:36:50,660 --> 00:37:00,770
translate it then and it's the same

00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:03,529
thing as done octahedron and also you

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:07,069
can expand and collapse more complex

00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:09,770
shape this one has 12 faces and they are

00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:12,920
Pentagon's and going are pulled out

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,900
words and other vertices they're opening

00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,049
up triangles and in between the edges

00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:23,839
there are rectangles that stretch until

00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:29,660
they get down to form squares and there

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:32,180
are more things like these more 3d

00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:42,160
solids there is an entire collection of

00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:42,160
them so let's see

00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:57,020
this one is more interesting it's again

00:37:53,060 --> 00:38:02,020
that rhombic dodecahedron 12 faces all

00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:05,810
long rambling and they expand outwards

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:08,350
there are squares and triangles opening

00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,900
up at the vertices and this is because

00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:14,750
this is not a universe is not a shade

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,550
that uniform at the vertices at certain

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,770
vertices there are four faces meeting

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,690
and at others there are just three faces

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,760
meeting so where there are three face is

00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,859
meeting you open up a triangle where

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:30,380
there are four faces meeting you open up

00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:33,980
a square and it's not limited to solid

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:38,210
though my talk today focuses on them but

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:44,030
there are also surfaces and you can do

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:50,980
surfaces with just CSS and something

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:54,280
like this one which is some kind of one

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,280
twisted tours

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,290
we can make it twist of course

00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,990
and yes suggest yes

00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:49,390
and since I think I've stretched the

00:39:46,640 --> 00:40:02,330
time of it I'll end with a demo on

00:39:49,390 --> 00:40:04,100
stretching again this is just ESS

00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:10,930
there's nothing in the jazz panel as you

00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,930
