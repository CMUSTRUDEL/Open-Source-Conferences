hello CSS comp how's it going yeah so

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:15,289
I'm Chris Epstein and I made a CSS

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:19,800
framework called compass and I work on a

00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:24,840
Prius CSS preprocessor called sass which

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,830
evidently everyone here uses um I have a

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,460
family that's my wife and my daughter

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:36,149
I'm guy and I'm an engineer at LinkedIn

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,930
in Mountain View California and they pay

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,940
me to work on open source software and

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,020
help them out with their tool chains and

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,940
front-end architecture things like that

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:54,829
so I went through this talk earlier

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:59,609
today it was like a little long maybe

00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:01,530
it'll be shorter this time right so this

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,339
whole talk kind of started as an idea

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,610
that it happened when Jeremy Keith wrote

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,979
a blog post recently he's a doc do on

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,799
Twitter lots of books and stuff like

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:18,720
that and talks at things like this and

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,890
so he so he there's a subject was like

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,409
Chris coyer was talking about

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,000
abstractions and how wonderful they are

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:30,600
and he's like I abstractions not so not

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,790
so sold but i don't think that SAS is

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,290
good because it's an abstraction he

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,810
thinks that SAS is good because it's a

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,780
well-designed abstraction and that it's

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:47,610
pretty easy to learn and I was like yes

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take it so I don't want to just

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,790
take a step back and say what makes a so

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,799
syntactically awesome so I want to tell

00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,070
you guys a little story about taste

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:04,940
collaboration and responsiveness because

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,270
it wasn't always like this

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:12,950
right so back in 2009 there was a blog

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,780
post by another speaker named Nathan or

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,150
who said things in his blog post like oh

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:23,790
it's a new syntax I don't want to learn

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:28,110
that it's a terrible idea for a CSS

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,640
syntax to be white space sensitive and

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,550
then at the time we had already

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,040
announced that we even have a new syntax

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,880
ah no one conduce to sin taxes that's

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,080
code complexity will crush them and we

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:48,060
had four loops in CSS why the frak would

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,320
anyone need those and so kind of come

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,980
back to these statements a little bit

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:57,540
later at the talk because the man had a

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,940
good point when I look back at SAS back

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,060
in two point oh I don't know about you

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,650
guys but this doesn't look like CSS this

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,400
doesn't look like anything that we have

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:13,320
worked with on a daily basis looks like

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:19,500
code of some kind and when I look at

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:22,470
where we're at today with sass 33 this

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,660
is code that's doing basically the same

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:30,080
thing it's actually a little bit fancier

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:33,330
in terms of its output um but and this

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,739
is this is all just really none of this

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,870
this is all abstract but none of this is

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:41,130
actually CSS that we're writing but it

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,220
feels more like CSS to me and I think it

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,890
feels more like CSS to people like

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,180
yourselves and that's weak and that

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,840
speaks to the fact that people are using

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,549
it more so and just to show kind of

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,820
bored of the power of the language has

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,160
come from like that's that code used to

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,170
generate CSS that looked a lot like this

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,799
there was a ton of duplication the

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,170
output was really simple but if you were

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,739
used to writing handcrafted CSS the fact

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,600
that you were creating these

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,040
abstractions meant that you wouldn't

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,670
really able to get the output that you

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,840
were used to making and so here we are

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,840
at SAS 33 and

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:27,050
like I can output basically handcrafted

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:29,510
output and the way I use this API the

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,510
API that I kind of fell in love with

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:37,010
back it's asked to point out is is

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:39,110
basically unchanged so the value of the

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,930
abstraction here was still pretty good

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,880
like we're able to eventually get the

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,940
language to a point where we're able to

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,830
output handcrafted quality code but we

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:54,580
didn't have to go and sacrifice that

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:57,920
really good API so how did we get here

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:02,450
well when SAS first started it had a

00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,620
vision that was basically make CSS and

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,750
tactically similar to some of these

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,110
other tools that we've been using in the

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,310
Ruby community specifically Ruby and

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,900
Hammel and over time I would say our

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,340
vision has really changed for the

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,790
project and we've largely discarded our

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,280
Ruby roots in many senses the

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,990
implementation is still in Ruby but our

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,060
vision now is not necessarily to

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,030
integrate well into the Ruby community

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:37,360
our vision now is to make the experience

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,360
of authoring stylesheets truly enjoyable

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:46,760
so what makes writing a stylesheet

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:48,560
enjoyable first I would say that one of

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,480
the reasons that writing sauce is

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,140
something that people take to Twitter

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,520
and say oh my god I love you is that

00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,400
they're able to express themselves

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,910
creatively in their authoring experience

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,200
and that's not to say that you can't

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,590
you're not being creative if you're

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,410
writing CSS obviously and summarized

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:14,570
shown us super creative stuff can get

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,940
made using just CSS but what I mean is

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,740
that the if someone has given you like

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,480
this is the exact output you need to

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,930
create like you can't be creative in

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,300
that output necessarily and so the way

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,040
you can find a creative outlet and your

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,720
authoring is to create these

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,400
abstractions and these named things and

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,960
named variables and there's a lot of

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,240
creativity happening just in the

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,150
offering process and that makes us enjoy

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,640
our job and it also removes a lot of

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,040
drudgery from the main tangents of our

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,840
style sheets and no one likes doing

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,030
Drudge drudgery work um but there's some

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:56,120
other things that are more my job

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:58,770
Nathan's job which is to make sure that

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,110
people who are writing SAS have a really

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:07,350
clear understanding of how SAS itself

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,730
works and that when you need to debug

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,840
something if something's not going quite

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,310
as planned that that's a really

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,840
straightforward process and lastly i

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,030
think it's an ads there's an out

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,090
spective trust that comes with building

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,970
a software project that is really

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,450
important and we spend a lot of time

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,770
thinking to ourselves about now that

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:35,600
we've earned your trust how can we not

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:39,690
lose your trust as we make changes but

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,370
we have a problem which is that no one

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:46,200
on the fast for team currently right

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:51,979
style sheets for living Nathan actually

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:56,669
never has nathan is a backend engineer

00:07:51,979 --> 00:08:01,890
brilliant software developer but that's

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:04,710
never written CSS for for a job I did

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,570
for a long time but my career just like

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,729
Nicole's has taken her down paths

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,440
necessarily she didn't expect my my

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,030
career path is not going down the path

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,820
of doing lots of front-end work lately

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:20,880
doing lots of awesome backend stuff

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:24,210
really enjoying it too so so is that a

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,160
problem though like I I contend that

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,540
with the right people in the right

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,919
processes and the right attitude which

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,990
is really an attitude that nathan has

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,089
had from the day one when I first

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,440
approached him and said I have some

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:43,380
ideas for how we could change that and

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,680
he you know sat down listen to me

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,830
so so I want to talk a little bit about

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,950
our philosophy for how we approach

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:56,880
software development even though our day

00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:03,680
to day lives are not spent doing CSS

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:05,880
itself right so we do a lot of listening

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,370
basically if new features are added to

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,310
sass because people come to us and tell

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,430
us that they need new features we aren't

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,390
out there discovering it we're not

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,670
deciding that some new feature just

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,130
needs to exist because we sat in an

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:26,670
ivory tower and that seemed like a good

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:30,090
idea so if you find yourself writing

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:33,540
code and you're like I doing X quite

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:37,260
often and it's a stood Y then X would be

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,630
so much easier we need to know that like

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,750
come to our issue tracker and tell us

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,580
that and you might not even know what ye

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,510
is like you might not understand what

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,970
sass can do to make your life as a CSS

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,980
author simpler but you just have this

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,580
gut sense that the way that you're doing

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,390
it seems like it's annoying so let's

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,150
have that conversation we do a lot of

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:06,360
listening on Twitter so here's an

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,820
interaction that the SAS mainly SAS

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:14,640
issue recessive twitter handle had the

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:20,670
other day if you can read it with fast

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:23,400
fast winds right we also do a lot of

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:29,220
listening to people that might otherwise

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:31,050
be called trolls and firstly I'd like to

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,710
say is like be careful who you call it

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,900
roll because when you make something

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,030
that's an open source project you put it

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,690
out there especially if that thing and

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,580
started to have some traction it's not a

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,230
it's not a person to the people who are

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,720
taking you to Twitter to criticize it

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,160
it's just a thing that you made and it's

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,780
probably not a thing that you made it's

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,120
just a thing that exists in their mind

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,610
and so they're not out trying to attack

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,209
you as a person they're just frustrated

00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,410
maybe they

00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,920
want to use it but they can't figure out

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,379
how so there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,319
negativity that gets thrown in our

00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,540
general direction and we try to have a

00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:13,679
really good attitude about it and not

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:19,679
take it too personally because every

00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:21,689
time a troll quote-unquote is talking

00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,819
and even if they're doing it till I get

00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:26,009
a rise out of us there's some element of

00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:27,749
truth there if they wouldn't be able to

00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,939
get a rise out of you if there wasn't a

00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:34,470
reason why they could kind of twist the

00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:38,879
knife a little bit so so take the moment

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:42,300
to listen to them and don't don't get

00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:46,860
your your back up just let it flow over

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,720
you that's our philosophy anyway and the

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,029
other thing I'll say is we've turned a

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,329
lot of people from that used to be

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,699
against SAS and actually quite vocal

00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:59,579
about not wanting to use CSS

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,509
preprocessors at all to people who i

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,579
have taken to becoming net promoters for

00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:07,589
technologies like that simply by

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:11,040
listening to them and saying hey you've

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,720
got a good point you probably expected

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,119
us to be defensive but no you're you're

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,290
right well get thinking about how to fix

00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:23,610
that problem so Nathan and I take a

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:29,040
tremendous amount of personal pride in

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:31,079
sass and compass and we basically will

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,350
just never ship anything that we're not

00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:38,699
a hundred percent satisfied at that

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:42,299
moment with and we spend a lot of time

00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:49,889
talking about minutia things what name

00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:51,149
to give some feature what like how all

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:55,799
these different edge cases might

00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:57,269
interact with each other the aesthetics

00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:03,480
of just how some some piece of code

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:05,069
might look and and also like we've spent

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,209
a lot of time on error messages and

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,160
things like that trying to make sure is

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,540
nicole was saying like that error

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
messages are your friends aren't to

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,779
guide you to the

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,529
we don't just say you have an error on

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:18,480
line 63 character 22 it's you have this

00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,029
error and by the way you might meant

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:29,040
this or we saw this but we expected to

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:30,180
see something else but fast with all of

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,029
the wonderful input we get all the time

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:38,790
is not a democracy because I feel very

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:43,980
strongly that consensus breeds

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,839
mediocrity and when you take a vote

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,800
about how something should work it's the

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,820
thing that everyone can agree on it ends

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,760
up being tends to be a little bit

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,970
watered down and so we're totally

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,770
willing to take heat to make a decision

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,589
that fits with a certain set of

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:14,700
aesthetic values that we might have and

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:21,870
and so we're we're just constantly sorry

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:25,560
I can almost my place here yeah so any

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,630
is it we're fine to not take take votes

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,610
on things but we care very deeply about

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,070
what everybody thinks it's not like

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:36,470
we're trying to ignore you but not every

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:38,730
idea is a good one and so to that point

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,500
we we actually have like a bit of a

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,930
mental checklist we go down every time

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,660
somebody proposes a new feature and we

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,520
try to really clearly explain to people

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,790
as best as we can if some new feature

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,600
doesn't get accepted at least initially

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,550
as will say okay here's the reason why

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,930
we think it would be a bad idea and so

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:02,820
we kind of run down this list of like is

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,450
there some way to do that using SAS

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,520
already what would that be is that can

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:14,190
you do a pure CSS because pure CSS is

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:16,440
pretty good sometimes too how would that

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,089
feature interact with other SAS features

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,500
we want to make sure that every new

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,589
feature that we add kind of has a

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,110
multiplicative effect over time with the

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,930
features

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,579
in that already exists and so we want to

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,470
understand that these are all building

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,510
blocks that we're adding and you guys

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,800
can assemble them into something really

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,769
unique and special we want things to be

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,029
as intuitive as possible and that's

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,140
intuitive in the sense that when you see

00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,320
it if you don't know what it means

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,410
you're able to figure it out even

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,000
without reading the docs hopefully its

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,980
intuitive in terms of how it's going to

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,490
behave in terms of what output you're

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,839
going to get in your CSS is it intuitive

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,940
in the sense that like if you have a

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,350
piece of code written on one line and

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,510
you were to copy and paste that piece of

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,360
code to another line in a slightly

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:08,029
different context would it behave like

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,860
you expected it to a surprising number

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,510
of feature requests come in where that

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:18,019
property wouldn't end of actually being

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:19,490
true so does it make it harder does the

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,010
new feature make it harder to maintain a

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,140
stylesheet so some some people will have

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,690
an isolated use case for which this

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,850
feature is perfect for but then they

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,070
forget about all these other ways that

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:35,209
that feature might actually make your

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:39,199
stylesheet more complicated and is there

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:40,850
a potential for misuse and and so this

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
one is really about as a scale because

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,820
every feature in SAS can be horribly

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,860
abused for the most part and so the

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,350
question is does the value that

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,779
something provides versus the the

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,070
possibility of people using it in a way

00:16:53,779 --> 00:17:02,360
that makes a stylesheet harder to

00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:06,650
understand balance out right so we kind

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,809
of listen we do things like so there

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,709
here's a bunch of features that get

00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:14,089
suggested probably several times a year

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,059
and there's another big conversation

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,309
about it and at least now we can mostly

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,949
point to people places where we've

00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:24,740
already kind of hashed it all out but

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,329
one feature is input blobbing so that's

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,740
like the ability to say like go to this

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,679
directory and basically load in all

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:35,410
these sauce files and put them in here

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,410
and that feature really breaks down when

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,140
you start worrying about like how the

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,090
Cascade is going to work and you get

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,470
these really subtle bugs when you add a

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,380
new style sheet you don't get to control

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,090
the order in which the the files would

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,340
come in to your to your style sheet and

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,930
so you end up these people scratching

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,720
their heads wondering why and something

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,310
broke on this other page and it's just

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,530
because like globbing picked it up in

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:03,000
and gave it an order that they probably

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,620
didn't expect so there's strip unit

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,240
function is one that comes up time and

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,650
time again which is like just take the

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,390
units off this number I don't need those

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,990
units I'm going to use it over here

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,430
without units like hey by the way the

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,190
unit on this hatch to a number that's

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,780
really meaningful information and if you

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,720
just want to throw that information way

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,130
you're probably not writing good code so

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,320
every time we use a sit down with them

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,430
walk through your code and like yeah

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:32,010
here's all the ways that code that

00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:34,050
you're just written will break another

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,180
feature that gets requested a lot is can

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,770
I just add important to a make thin so

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:46,080
that everything inside that mixin gets

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:48,990
important yeah so like basically I just

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,880
I think important is the sign of bad CSS

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:58,020
architecture and I refuse to be part of

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:59,520
the problem so no another one is I wrote

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,740
this property and it's it there's a

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,650
mixin of that same name just make that

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,700
into the into the mixin like just expand

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,150
the mix in wherever you see that

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,220
property and basically we just that

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,710
intuition about how a stylesheet should

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,970
work how house how do you if you look at

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,100
source code you know what's going to

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,660
happen when you compile it kind of falls

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,550
away because you could import that

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,770
property from a different place in your

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,110
style sheet and by just looking at your

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,300
source code you don't know something's

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,280
happening right there and so were you

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,410
reject that feature because you can't

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,010
visually see that their property is

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:39,120
going to change usually it's in the

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,430
context of like vendor prefixing and

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,330
obviously there are great tools like

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:47,840
auto prefix sir

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,279
and that will add prefixes if you don't

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,299
want to use compasses make sense if

00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,309
you're like that's the way you want it

00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,200
to work that that specific use case is

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,480
actually it's a good use of that use

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,519
case but most of the other use cases

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,919
like we can't just say oh well it's

00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,809
going to only work for properties that

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,169
exist in the CSS BEC because fast

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:10,010
doesn't know those are so that's a

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:12,230
feature we end up rejecting another

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,590
feature that gets asked for all the time

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:17,149
is extend in a media block who here has

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:24,889
ever tried to do and extend an immediate

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:26,450
look yeah you can't do that or maybe you

00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:29,929
can so let's talk about that one in

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:33,649
particular for a second so this is a

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:37,760
case of Nathan and I'm missing the

00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:41,330
forest for the trees for about a year

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,500
and a half because what happens is Pete

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,080
so people want to write this code

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,059
basically they want to say oh yeah well

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,029
when I'm inside you know a small screen

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,029
sort of environment apply these extend

00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:58,190
these placeholders lectures with my toad

00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:59,510
and so that it adjusts yeah and and and

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,179
every time they said that what they'd

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:05,169
say is can you give me this output this

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,850
is what I want to see and we're like Oh

00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:10,669
see that's actually seems like a bad

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,950
idea to us because what this involved

00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:15,470
was us taking a selector that was

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,480
written at a certain document order and

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,380
moving it to another place in the style

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,330
sheet and the Cascade is pretty

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,269
important to the way things end up

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:30,350
looking and we just felt that that was a

00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:34,580
had a high likelihood of creating bugs

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:39,289
that were really subtle and unlikely to

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,880
be easy to debug it also didn't really

00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,340
feel like extending something I felt

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
like mixing in something and so I'd be

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,539
like well just when she write a mix in

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,389
and had that mixin sometimes include and

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,309
sometimes extend like I think all the

00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:55,879
power of class exists for you to pull

00:21:52,309 --> 00:22:00,289
this off but about the seven

00:21:55,879 --> 00:22:03,529
thousands of time that people brought

00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:08,719
this up nathan was basically at the

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:10,099
point where we were ready to give in and

00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:15,440
say maybe we should just move all this

00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:17,449
stuff around or whatever and I I had

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,239
this epiphany that well actually maybe

00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:23,119
we could just take a different tack and

00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:25,489
I finally like light bulb moment saw

00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,019
that what if we moved we do have to do

00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:30,079
some duplication but what if that

00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,369
duplication happened at the point of the

00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,849
place of the original structure that's

00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:37,339
being extended then it's easy to see

00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:42,679
where it got where that it got added is

00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:44,719
its and the Cascade is unaffected so we

00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,940
kind of agreed recently on one on an

00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,649
issue that we're going to add this so

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,069
after going through the effort of

00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:54,440
deprecating at extend and that media

00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:58,159
blocks and then removing it from the

00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,909
language turning it into an error we've

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,699
come around full circle by listening to

00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:07,309
feedback time and time again to add that

00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:10,779
feature in so that should be in whatever

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,779
is our next release probably 34

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,480
if someone had just said they wanted

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:20,080
that output we probably would have

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:24,100
gotten here a lot sooner but sometimes

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,660
the forest is in the way so another

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
thing that happened in this ass 33

00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,860
release was that we were just about

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,900
ready to release in fact we even

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,700
discussed the idea of it being so ready

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,400
to go that we didn't even need to do for

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,679
these candidates oh my god with you know

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,679
just to do over these candidate one or

00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,450
two see just case were small bugs so we

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,350
released summer these candidates and

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:54,820
there's a new feature you could use the

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:55,990
script selector incest to access that in

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,460
sort of sorry you can use the parent

00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,580
selector and sass and access that inside

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,710
of your script code and it worked really

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,059
good in almost every use case except

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,549
where when you started having comma

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:09,610
selectors so you're basically have two

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:12,400
parents or four parents instead of just

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:14,620
one and so the code that people were

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,110
writing that needed to take that idea

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,330
into account got really messy really

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,160
fast and the feedback that we got from

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,730
the community was like I don't

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,760
understand what's going on here and we

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,990
talked about a lot of ideas in my in the

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,570
slides when I published later there's a

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:35,590
link to a blog post that Nathan wrote

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,030
all about kind of this discovery process

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,590
and what we're planning on doing about

00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,049
it and it talks about all the different

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,150
ideas that we discussed etc and kind of

00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,770
what we plan to do which is probably a

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,390
bunch of functions to help manage this

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:50,890
process but we knew that it wasn't ready

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,030
for prime time and since we wouldn't

00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,309
want to ship anything we didn't

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,929
absolutely love and we didn't know maybe

00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,419
we'd have to go through harder work to

00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,700
deprecate something in the future just

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:03,580
decided to pull the feature that delayed

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,960
are released by several months but in

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:11,880
our opinion that was better than

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,880
releasing something half-baked so

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,910
something that I've kind of learned over

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:23,200
the years working on SAS is that

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:25,360
patience is a virtue and that our own

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,370
understanding really cannot be

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,679
rushed like no amount of pounding your

00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,929
head against a desk is probably gonna

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,590
make you understand what it is you're

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:38,290
making any faster as a person who's done

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,510
startups most of his life I think I

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,500
finally understood what my startups were

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:48,220
supposed to be about five years in

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:51,280
sometimes three years in and but i think

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:54,190
our brains just need time to figure out

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,570
what it is and you could have done a

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,740
bunch of experimentation and may be

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:01,540
iterated to some great thing but i'm not

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,290
sure that that works with a language and

00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,940
so for us the long release cycles that

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:10,090
SAS has had throughout the years which

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,940
is tend to be about every year has been

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,040
really good i think for the trust that

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,580
we've built with the community and it's

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,540
also it led us develop our own sense of

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:26,440
what's asses and what it should be and

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,820
so what we tend to do is a few really

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,360
well-thought-out features in every

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,510
release it gives time for the community

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,600
itself to adjust and to have a stable

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:40,480
set of time to count on those features

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:46,360
existing and also to develop best

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,650
practices around them and yeah so I

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:53,919
think that's all the points they're cool

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:55,570
and so like I said like over the years I

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,059
think we've really learned what SAS is

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:00,160
what it should be kind of our philosophy

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:03,940
around it but I don't want to make any

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:07,000
excuses for the fact that 2008 me this

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:09,970
was amazing and I was speaking

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,250
about it and blogging about it and I

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,960
loved it and we were shipping this and

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:20,620
we were happy and we were proud of it

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:23,880
and so it and that's okay people gave us

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,880
feedback and we adjusted

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,690
Oh

00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,080
hope I didn't know so well are you

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,180
certain the Oracle didn't maybe we did

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,430
something wrong or it didn't do

00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,530
something no what happened happened and

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:55,480
couldn't have happened any other way how

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:59,140
do you know we are still alive alright

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,790
so yeah I love that quote um and so I

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,050
don't think I don't like I don't know

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,700
about you guys but if you have ever done

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,550
something you look back at me like such

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,290
crap why did I do that but it's okay

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,990
like that's the path that you took to

00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,820
get where you got and I think the in

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,400
some respects actually this the syntax

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,310
that sass had initially the really weird

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,680
stuff that was going on there to use

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:24,730
another matrix reference it freed our

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:27,160
minds of the constraints of what CSS was

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,650
we were looking at this other stuff this

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,470
weird syntax with the colons in front

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,150
and exclamation marks everywhere and we

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,850
were able to say you know maybe control

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,190
directives make sense here or maybe

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,570
maybe this other future like inheritance

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,390
and all these other stuff we just kind

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,970
of went crazy with it and I don't know

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,680
if we had had that original sin tax if

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,510
we had have taken a CSS syntax from the

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,180
beginning I don't think we would have

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,850
gotten there I think that that's the the

00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,010
bad syntax that most people don't use

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,530
and never liked was what gave us the

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,790
ability to reimagine new capabilities

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:06,940
that never would have come to our minds

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:08,770
so one of the reasons I'm giving this

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,960
talk is that we need your help like I

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,440
said we are not writing a bunch of style

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,050
sheets and so we don't have that daily

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,090
necessity being the mother of invention

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:21,220
going on and so I want to just walk

00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,840
through some basic things that if you

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,930
guys would like to get involved with SAS

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,430
or any other open source projects these

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,880
are some really basic strategies that

00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:34,480
are super useful to open source projects

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,270
and general but specifically for us if

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,430
you're interested in being involved the

00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,840
easiest thing to do on github is just to

00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:45,370
watch our subscribe to a project and

00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,470
whenever a new new issue comes in and

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,480
you're like that seems like

00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,770
thing I would care about just go in you

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,470
scroll down to the bottom of the page

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,740
and click like listen or subscribe to

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,909
this issue you don't have to comment but

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:04,650
if you do you'll be automatically

00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:06,830
subscribed on any time so basically all

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:10,590
of the user support of SAS falls on

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,900
Nathan and I and so anytime that the

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:18,030
community can help triage common issues

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:19,860
and can help like confirm bug reports

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,950
and tell people tell us like yeah yeah

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,419
this is happening definitely and here's

00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,950
some more details about it like I

00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,799
actually had to do these other things to

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,350
get the issue to to manifest that's

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,289
super useful if there's a regression

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,750
using git bisect to like find the

00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:39,030
commits that that regression happened in

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:45,270
this is especially useful in the alpha

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:46,980
testing period of new releases and you

00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:49,559
if you could tell the user like yeah

00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,700
yeah that's a bug or whatever but this

00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,650
other thing that you could do right here

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,600
that'll that'll work for you these are

00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:58,200
all great things that you can do that

00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,940
would take a bulk of time off of Nathan

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:07,440
and I so that we could focus on doing

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:10,049
the meteor stuff that needs to happen we

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,700
commonly seek feedback on the issue list

00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:14,190
any time we're adding a new feature

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,080
we're having idea we start a new issue

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,690
on the issue tracker and we are

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,669
basically hoping that people will chime

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,679
in and let us know what they think give

00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:24,990
us give us positive feedback if it's

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:29,340
negative feedback tell us that we're

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:31,710
idiots or let us know if we're on the

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,340
right track so those are all really

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,659
super useful stuff but if you're going

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,010
to do that there are some basic

00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:42,419
community interaction guidelines that

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:49,500
I'd like to request they basically boil

00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:51,409
down to don't be a dick so basically not

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,970
everyone is going to be as tapped into

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:56,880
the issue what's going on the SAS

00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:59,220
development this this might be the 17th

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,270
time that someone has filed a bug

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,230
about or asking for some feature or and

00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,140
you know they didn't search the issue

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,059
tracker shame on them but so what it's

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,580
not a good user experience to be

00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:16,350
chastised for filing a bug especially

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,760
when there's actually a bug so a lot of

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,080
times people file bugs and like they

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,390
just don't understand something about

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:26,789
CSS don't be like Lau noob CSS learn

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:29,039
just you know send them a link to some

00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:31,650
great place on the w3c side or some

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,330
other tutorial place and help them

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,929
understand what they don't understand

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:39,539
it's it's ok takes a few extra minutes

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:44,820
but it's a community and helping each

00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:46,200
other out is super handy and every once

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,880
in a while there's some entitled jerk

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,190
that comes on is like I can't believe

00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,870
you guys have had this bug open for

00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:57,840
three years and I just bumped into it

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:59,400
again and baba Baba and most of the time

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,140
the right thing to do in that situation

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:06,240
is close your browser move on go do

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,090
something else take a walk don't tell

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,880
don't like fall into the trap of pushing

00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:14,340
back against their anger they're upset

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,610
for a reason it's okay for them to be

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,900
upset there might be entitled it might

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:24,900
be feeling entitled to something they're

00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:26,789
not it's okay like we're not we don't we

00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,440
don't generally like come back at them

00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:37,830
or just basically say thanks for your

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:39,000
input and move on so just a few of the

00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,490
things that you guys can do is help us

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,460
test alpha releases when we get those

00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,990
out and then there's just all the other

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,370
great community stuff so the SAS

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,919
community is pretty vibrant it's one of

00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:55,309
the reasons that people tend to pick SAS

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:58,080
over other implementations and or other

00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:59,490
preprocessors I should say so you know

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,049
walk about your experiences if you've

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,000
got some new technique write a blog post

00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,460
I know that it's really easy on Twitter

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,799
to like spam out 14 tweets all in a row

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,260
but it's super ephemeral that stuff's

00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,490
gone like when you google for it you're

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,780
not going to find it you're not gonna be

00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,870
able to read it all in one place

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,429
so I know that the age of blogging kind

00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:22,620
of feels like it's declining but

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:24,350
actually blogging is really useful & and

00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:31,080
so I would just encourage people to like

00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:32,760
do that if you can if you have local

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,530
meetups of course it's great to speak at

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,450
them and share your experiences not just

00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,250
about SAS but about anything cool that's

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:42,690
going on in your life that's the way we

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:45,630
learn as a community please like I said

00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,669
give us great feature suggestions we

00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:51,179
love little polish patches things that

00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:53,669
are like fixing tiny documentation bugs

00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,190
or maybe there's a typo like the long

00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:57,570
tail effective contributions to an open

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,100
source project or what make them really

00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:04,020
great with the SAS link com site is been

00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,550
rewritten recently there's a bunch of

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,890
docs on there but i think that site

00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,810
could still be way better so would you

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,970
know you guys are all web developers

00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,530
like come help us write docs you're the

00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,240
target user how often do you get to be

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:19,020
the target user for the site that you're

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,930
working on so that's all really awesome

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:26,220
stuff so that was what I had for you

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,480
today thank you very much I hope that

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,790
you guys were able to learn a little bit

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,600
about how sass works take away just

00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,070
about open source management in general

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,690
you know the SAT like I feel really

00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,120
indebted to the open source community in

00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,230
general over my life SAS is my way of

00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,660
giving back whether or not you

00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:46,850
contribute to SAS I hope you find some

00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,850
