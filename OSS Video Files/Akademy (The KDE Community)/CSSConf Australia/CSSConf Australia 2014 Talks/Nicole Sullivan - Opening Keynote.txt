	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,879
so I'm going to start off by telling a

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,200
little bit of the same story but I guess

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,950
my perspective on it is a little bit

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,950
different than Ben's so thank you so

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,360
much for coming here i I'm so excited to

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,820
be here and I can't even tell you like

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,980
ten months after the first CSS comp ever

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,439
existed here it is in Australia it's

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,980
it's kind of unbelievable and fantastic

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,210
and really great to have you here so

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,130
with a ton of help from other people

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,420
just like Ben I organized the first CSS

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,940
conf in the US and I'd been to lots of

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,170
JavaScript conferences before that and

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,129
they sort of thought I was a designer

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,629
and I'd been to lots of design

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,329
conferences and they thought I was a

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,329
giant nerd and I thought wait we're

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,460
where are my people um I kind of

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,629
wondered you know why CSS seemed like it

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,430
kept falling in the cracks between

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,280
design and development where was that

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,190
space for CSS to exist as like a nerdy

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,739
discipline unto itself I wanted to hang

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,530
out with CSS devs like you face to face

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,619
I wanted to spend time with people who

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,299
loved and frankly also hated CSS just as

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,540
much as I do you know hated it by

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,280
knowing it really really well and so

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,659
that's sort of what CSS conf was born

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,159
out of I'm very luckily indeed in the

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,570
audience that day right up there there's

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,600
a red circle it's a little hard to see

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,729
was Christina and she saw how much this

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,500
could do for the community and she

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,880
thought and I had been bugging her kind

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,890
of like I've been bugging been saying

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,390
hey this should go to the EU this should

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,009
go to the EU and she was always like oh

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,680
my god so much work I don't think I can

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,540
do it and then she came to the US

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,549
version and she had such a good time

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,470
that she said this absolutely has to

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,570
happen she went back to Berlin and

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,130
recruited Michael and together they

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,649
decided to make CSS comp EU happen

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:57,030
luckily in the audience that day was Ben

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,490
and so Ben who I had been again maybe

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,500
pressuring slightly to bring it to to

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,950
Australia well the truth is after we had

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,299
CSS called in the u.s. Australians kept

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,700
saying when's it coming here when's it

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,890
coming here when's it coming here

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,780
you all are not shy about saying when

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,099
you want something oh and so I was

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,650
really impressed by that and thought we

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,239
have to find a way to make this happen

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,040
and so I'd been bugging been saying hey

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,870
you know this would be a good thing to

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,090
do along with jay s conf you know maybe

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,860
think about it and finally when he came

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,780
to the EU version he was like yeah

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,610
absolutely this this has to happen I

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,470
kind of think he wanted to do it all

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,880
along even though he was reticent about

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,549
the amount of work he seemed pretty

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,690
excited about it straight away at least

00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:39,049
that's what I tell myself when I'm

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,760
worried that i pressured him too much so

00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,620
he came back here like he said assembled

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,019
a team of Fiona Tim Glenn and Michael

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,160
and they worked so incredibly hard that

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,360
I'd love it if we could start off the

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:56,660
day by just giving them a round of

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:57,860
applause for all the work the other

00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,239
important thing that I want you to think

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,780
about is that next year it could

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,150
absolutely be you up here on this stage

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,829
CSS conf is has the idea of being

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,170
inclusive that anybody could be speaking

00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,910
here that you know the cool thing that

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,079
you work on in the next 12 months could

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,000
be the thing that brings you up here

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,829
onto this stage next year to present it

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,150
to everybody else so kind of keep that

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,569
in the back of your head that this is

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,030
this part of CSS conf is also where you

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:29,150
belong and that that's an important part

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:31,340
of it um so I mean move on I just am

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,889
really excited as well about the lineup

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,889
that we have for you I think that

00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:38,840
they've chosen a great lineup and I'm

00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,090
really excited about it they are doing

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,250
some amazing work they're challenging

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,420
some preconceived ideas and really

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,519
pushing the boundaries of what's

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,540
possible with CSS I think you're going

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,280
to see some stuff today that you

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,889
wouldn't have even thought a person

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,660
could do so I've been looking forward to

00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:56,569
Nicholas's talk about components and

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,190
Leah talking about color i'm pretty sure

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,500
that Christopher is going to blow us

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,660
away with his talk about testing CSS

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,139
that's a topic that's really close to my

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,720
heart as well and I'm just hoping as I

00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,959
was a tu to keep up with Anna's talk at

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,900
all about polygons especially the math

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,700
side so i really think that you're going

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,650
to love their topics as much as the

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,180
organizers do and really understand why

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,800
why they were chosen

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,350
so I ask you kind of a philosophical

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,240
question which is you know why are you

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,139
here why are you here today what are you

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,610
what are you doing here and also say I

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,130
honestly have no idea right I don't know

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,310
why you're here i would say that neither

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,810
do you and in fact even if you think you

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,810
do you actually don't know why you're

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,330
here so when i come to a conference with

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,210
a preconceived notion of like why i'm in

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,400
that spot I'm rarely right often there's

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,870
something totally unexpected and kind of

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,030
wonderful that happens when you get a

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,180
group of like like-minded developers

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,220
together in the same place so maybe your

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,960
boss sent you to learn new skills and

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,030
bring them back to the company that

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,410
could be a thing maybe you brought

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,270
yourself because your boss is a little

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,410
bit disinterested in your skill set and

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,140
you think that that's something that you

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,490
need to pay attention to maybe it'll be

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,530
to have a hallway conversation with

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,940
someone that inspires you I think the

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,430
hallway conversations are very

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,780
underrated at conferences sometimes

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,250
that's the ends up being the most

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,919
important thing more important than the

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,900
speakers are the talks or anything else

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,220
um maybe you will meet someone here who

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,350
will help you solve a really hard

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,400
technical problem next month something

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,850
you can't even imagine you're going to

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,190
have to deal with yet or maybe you're a

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,870
talk about a new technology that you

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,840
haven't played with and it'll capture

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,160
your interest in your imagination maybe

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,970
you're here to get re-energized maybe

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,140
you're sort of bored or feeling in a rut

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,419
maybe you're here to find your community

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,610
and maybe you're here to realize that

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:56,050
other people actually do love CSS as

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,810
much as you do one reason why I'm happy

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,760
to be its scss compass because I like

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,340
the idea of balancing the time spent as

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,020
a student and a teacher I don't know

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,330
about yourself but in my day-to-day work

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,490
life I'm the CSS expert right people are

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,500
coming to me and they're asking how do I

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,450
do this is this code okay should I have

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,669
done it this way you know can you give

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,440
me a code review or they're giving me

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,120
CSS that's all written that's crazy

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,680
pants and I'm going say wait a minute

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,229
could we maybe refigure this a little

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,660
bit and so it's nice to be at a

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,330
conference where there are lots of CSS

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,129
experts and I can take a step back in

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,199
and step into the student role for a bit

00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,629
and be able to step out of that I have

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,580
to already know everything the role that

00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:41,379
can end up happening when you're the CSS

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,479
expert in your company the word career

00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:45,039
is kind of an odd one it rose in

00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,590
popularity in the latter part of the

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,560
last century weirdly it has its origins

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,840
in French and Latin words for racetracks

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't know about you but i think that

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,129
focus on career rather than what brings

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,180
you joy can make you in a feeling like

00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,009
you're running after some sort of

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,349
abstract notion of success rather than

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,500
pursuing your true interests you end up

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,030
sort of scrambling for you know what you

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,090
think matters instead of really

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,379
following your heart so i would say i

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,389
welcome you to your career and

00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:18,009
follow your heart instead sort of it's

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,569
impossible to figure out how the things

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,580
that you do day-to-day are going to fit

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,629
into a big picture so i think it's

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,400
important to follow your gut right to do

00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:28,779
stuff that interests you and stop doing

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
things that don't interest you and

00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,529
that's really hard especially if you're

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,090
good at them right talk to people you

00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,219
enjoy and see what the developing

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,349
relationship brings step out of your

00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:41,729
comfort zone and try a technology that

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,629
you haven't known anything about before

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,979
there's a cartoon I don't know if it

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,800
have was ever in Australia it's called

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,060
Family Circus do you have that no it's

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,500
pretty dumb so you're not missing out

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,389
much um anyway there's this a little boy

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,889
in the cartoon called Billy and we goes

00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,930
out to play in the neighborhood they do

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,159
these paths to show like what he did all

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,509
day sort of tramping around the

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,069
neighborhood and playing with this and

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,449
playing with that and running off into

00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,919
the neighbor's yard and back and

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,740
climbing a tree and all this kind of

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,659
thing and so they show that as like a

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,479
sort of crazy dotted line to show how he

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,860
spent his day I read a research paper

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,930
that showed that people who considered

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,969
themselves the luckiest had the most

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,529
variation in their day they didn't take

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:22,089
the same path to work every day they

00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:25,000
didn't talk to the same people every day

00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,650
they engaged in different ways and they

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,520
loud there to be a lot of room in their

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,260
life and unexpected tangents and in

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,180
allowing that space they basically

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,159
allowed room for the unexpected

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,140
so perhaps this conference is that

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,029
chance to allow room for you to have a

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,940
chance meeting or a happy collaboration

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,380
to have that bit of luck that comes from

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,360
doing something which is a little bit

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,830
outside of what you usually do so the

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
next part of my talk is a little bit

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,500
self-indulgent so I hope you'll bear

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,770
with me but I swear it will probably all

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,500
come together at the end a few years ago

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,390
John Alsop asked me to speak at a career

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,080
event for college students actually it's

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,330
it was it in Sydney I think yeah it was

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,339
definitely in Australia and we were

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,410
meant to help those students understand

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,970
like if they wanted to be where we were

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,770
one day what did they need to do what

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,520
was the password of the steps along the

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:23,380
route to get to this career and I'm not

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,480
really quite sure that my story was what

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,730
the teachers had in mind we're perfectly

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,020
honest so if you don't mind I'm going to

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,820
tell you a little bit about it because I

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,380
think it relates to that allowing space

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:39,720
for luck and chance in our lives I grew

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,730
up in a teeny fishing village it was a

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,089
few miles by a few miles it had 3,000

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,250
people my high school was terrible I

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:50,110
graduated seventh in my class without

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,220
having any idea when the two world wars

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:58,630
were I was sort of barely barely

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:01,000
educated when I left there and so when I

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,790
went to school when I went to college I

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,770
was so excited every semester the course

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,810
catalog would come out and I would sign

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,480
up for whatever caught my interest I

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,180
took a logic and chemistry and calculus

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,910
political economy of women economics of

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,240
post-independence Africa Buddhism

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,040
sculpture Indian classical dance

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,100
japanese history biology experimental

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,810
economics I took whatever seemed like

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,970
the thing that drew my attention and

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,360
seemed really cool and that i wanted to

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,279
know about I took graduate level courses

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,170
when they would let me but mostly just

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,240
took whatever would quite catch my

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,420
interest that semester and it was kind

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,709
of a neat to see how these disperse

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,100
topics would end up sort of tying in

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,000
together and actually being interrelated

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,230
but then came the moment

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,230
where I had a pretty difficult

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,670
conversation with my dad who said you

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,100
know Nicole we sent you to college to

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,660
get a degree and get a good job you have

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,540
to think about graduated and I was like

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,590
oh graduating huh I hadn't really

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,600
thought about that my family was very

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,160
education focused so we were going to

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,420
school but it was a kind of education

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,040
that was focused on the job you were

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,390
going to get afterwards it wasn't really

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,910
being educated for educated shins sake

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,320
so I sort of took that into account and

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,590
said all right I do actually need to

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,270
graduate at some point so what I did is

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,370
I actually added up all the classes I'd

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,170
taken and I added up all the classes

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,850
needed for all the majors and found the

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,420
one that I was mathematically closest to

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,830
having a degree in anyway and finished

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,080
that one also i have an undergraduate

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,890
degree in economics as it turns out um

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,230
yeah random but sometimes these random

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,660
things just sort of work out and

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,190
sometimes they don't so it turns out an

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,980
undergraduate degree in economics gets

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,290
you some pretty terrible jobs um I was a

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,270
credit report writer and that is as

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,900
awful a job as it sounds like it would

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,400
be um it was it was terrible I did call

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,380
people up and get them to tell me stuff

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,910
about their credit oh um anyway so I

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,320
wasn't really enough of a masochist to

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,850
go to graduate school which you'd have

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,350
to to really do anything with economics

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,120
and anyway my interest in economics

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,760
mainly was because it was the

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,700
mathematically most close a major to

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,490
what I had taken already so I decided to

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,310
pursue a long time dream and become a

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,920
carpenter and this gonna sound really

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,240
random but I had always wanted to i'd

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
done carpentry with my dad and my

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,210
grandpa but because of that education

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,040
focused on my family it wasn't a

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,620
possibility wasn't even something they

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,330
would consider letting me do so I called

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,400
every place in the newspaper for a while

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,589
for several weeks and I said give me a

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,770
chance give me a chance finally this guy

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:45,450
says come work with us for a week if you

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:47,580
don't suck we might not fire you crap

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,490
okay I'm going to do it though and so I

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,220
did and then I ended up working in

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,110
carpentry for three years I learned so

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,210
much about constructing systems reading

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,750
plans improvising when those plans don't

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,220
work out and standing on literally the

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,190
quality of your work that you did before

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,650
you know when you are a carpenter one

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,690
day you lay the framing and the next day

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,740
you lay the sheathing over the framing

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,300
and the next day you lay you lay the tar

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,810
paper over the sheathing and the next

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,880
day you lay the shingles over that if

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,800
you're building a roof and when you do

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,540
that it means that every day you're

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,540
walking on the quality of the work that

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,580
you made before and I feel like that it

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,770
shouldn't be related to web development

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,170
at all but it absolutely has tied back

00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:38,090
in and sort of standing by the quality

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,930
of the kind of websites that you build

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,960
and then there was dance dance

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:46,290
revolution so I swear this is going to

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,610
tie in while I was a carpenter I ended

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,220
up randomly playing dance dance

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,890
revolution with John Alsop and Burt boss

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,470
in Japan I know it seems completely

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,590
random I swear it will it will be

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,480
related we weren't anywhere near as good

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,130
as those guys up there we thought we

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,080
were and then a bunch of Japanese

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:08,790
teenagers came showed us up completely

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,640
it ended up being super important that

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,710
dance dance revolution game so after

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,320
that I hurt my hands really badly I lost

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,910
sensation up to my wrists the doctors

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,980
basically said I had to find a new line

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,140
of work carpentry was too hard I wasn't

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,120
meant to be lifting heavy weight like

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,770
that I I needed to find something else

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,420
to do so I randomly moved to Paris uh so

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,130
all these things you know you you make

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,720
these choices and in the moment you just

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,580
you go with your gut and you don't know

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,200
how it's all going to add up right but

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,490
it ends up kind of adding up I ended up

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,950
accidentally enrolling in engineering

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,660
school in Paris my French was really

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,880
terrible and I thought it was a little

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,590
night class in Java and it turns out

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,120
three months later my friend had gotten

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,650
better to the point where I realized oh

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,390
my goodness i'm an engineering school

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:59,209
and wonder it's so hard

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,980
but uh well i was there i was able to

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,769
start working for an agency called

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,330
aquino and they give me a chance to work

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:09,170
on some of the biggest sites in Europe

00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:13,029
and there my love of sort of scale and

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,750
performance and speed was born and

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,970
because of the work that I had done

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,649
there Yahoo actually offered me the

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,820
opportunity to move to the Silicon

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,670
Valley and work in their exceptional

00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,490
performance team working on why slow and

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,290
things like that I thought that that was

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,880
my thing I thought that that was my

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,940
career and that was what I was going to

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,740
do and then I got laid off and that was

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,320
not in my plans that was not what I

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,000
thought would happen it was the sort of

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,529
bad old days of Yahoo tons of people

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,870
were being laid off it was sort of the

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:47,500
worst economy in recent memory at least

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,500
in the US and it was pretty terrifying

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,089
weirdly it connects back to Australia

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,640
around the same time John al-saud got in

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,339
touch and he's asked me if I wanted to

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,350
speak at web directions north and you

00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,329
gotta love John because he's absolutely

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,310
willing to give a chance to speak to a

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,320
speaker who's never spoken to anywhere

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,390
before he thought maybe I had good ideas

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,600
he thought give me a chance can be a

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,720
shot and see how it goes and he did so

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,730
that dance dance revolution game from

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,709
years before all the sudden turned out

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,230
to be the reason why I became a speaker

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,910
ever at all I never could have predicted

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,500
that it was just sure Dance Dance

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,399
Revolution sounds fine let's go do that

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,070
um so that night I was supposed to do

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,940
the standard performance talk for John

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,589
talking about you know front end

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,760
performance and why slow rules and all

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,910
those things which are you know

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,890
important maybe a little on the boring

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,510
side for that for that particular thing

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,240
but I you know kind of wanted to talk

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,800
about it but the organizer said well why

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
don't you talk about your own stuff why

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,709
don't you talk about what matters to you

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,600
and I was like really someone's gonna

00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:55,820
let me talk about my CSS ideas and that

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,610
night I stayed up all night writing the

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,190
first object oriented CSS presentation

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,860
that I would ever give

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,140
and that slide deck has almost a half a

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,730
million views which is just incredible

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,740
you can't predict that you know somebody

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,079
one night says why don't you talk about

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,189
your stuff instead of just giving you

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,860
know talking about other people's stuff

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,780
and I was like huh I I guess I could try

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,400
that you know it's just those moments

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,339
where you make a decision because your

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,250
gut says go for it and and you don't

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:27,040
know necessarily how it'll end up but it

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,720
ends up being important it's sort of

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,190
similar to how i started a company named

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,750
Lee did it because I got laid off and I

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,450
didn't know what else to do but it ended

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,570
up working out really well it's also why

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,430
i started CSS cough I'd gone to JS comps

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,100
and I was like hey wait I want this for

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:45,970
us I want this for my community I want

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:48,430
us to start building a community it's

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,310
the last summer I watched a really silly

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:54,670
romantic comedy it's called he's just

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,810
not that into you sure which of the

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,510
details of this to give you because

00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,850
they're all a little bit that'd but the

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,220
rough idea is that the one on the bottom

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,990
right corner there he's trying to date

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,310
and she keeps going out on dates with

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,140
guys and they keep not calling her back

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,610
and they they're you know they're not

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,190
making second dates and they're just

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,990
sort of flaky and the one on the top

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,850
right there is a bartender who starts

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,950
giving her advice and says you know if

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,180
they liked you they'd call you back if

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,860
they're not calling you back it's

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,830
because they're just not that into you

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,050
and I had this like giant aha moment

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,700
with this and I was like oh my goodness

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,830
I'm just not that into my company

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,780
anymore I was like I don't want to call

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,690
my company back I don't want to go out

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,060
on another date I was like I dread the

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,530
moments when I have to be working on you

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,900
know choosing a health plan for

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,340
employees and all this stuff and it was

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,870
so hard because it was something that I

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,700
had poured years of love into and I

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,010
wanted it to exist I wanted it to be a

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,690
thing but I realized to just I wasn't

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,580
that into it anymore and I couldn't be

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,380
following my heart and doing that thing

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,360
even though he gave me the chance to

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,420
work with people like Fiona who I would

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,890
just feel absolutely graced and lucky

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,250
that I got to work with someone who's

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:07,150
such a skilled CSS coder I still had to

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,419
let it go so I quit and truth be told at

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,830
that moment I had no

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,899
idea how that fit into the bigger

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,970
picture I had no idea if it was going to

00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:18,009
work out I still it's you know it's on

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:20,090
the fence but it seems good so far I

00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,980
ended up working for a company called

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,899
pivotal labs and they do a hundred

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,580
percent pairing and so I've been able to

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:27,230
work together with engineers side by

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,359
side and have them basically take me

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,970
from being pretty purely front end to

00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,799
being you know a full stack developer I

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,720
right Ruby code every day I change

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,179
routes and controllers and models I

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,409
interact with a database I do all kinds

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,049
of stuff that I would have thought a

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,999
year ago would have been impossible I've

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,369
learned things like error messages are

00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,989
my friends I always thought when I tried

00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:49,460
back end coding that if I was getting

00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:52,519
error messages it meant that I was doing

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,499
it wrong it's a simple silly thing right

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,379
I didn't realize that the way that you

00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:58,999
code is by getting getting error message

00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,739
after error message moving further down

00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:03,200
in the stack and getting closer and

00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:04,879
closer to having your code actually

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,009
worked the full way through the stack

00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:08,480
when I realized that it was such an aha

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,369
moment I realized I'd been giving myself

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,830
crap for years thinking that I was just

00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:14,419
not very skilled in this direction and

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,789
in fact it was just a fundamental

00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,499
misunderstanding and if I hadn't been

00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,269
able to work with those engineers and

00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:22,820
watch them go through the same thing I

00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:26,239
remember working with one engineer one

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,100
day and he got um he got tears in his

00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,440
eyes actually he was so frustrated I

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,609
mean it was very subtle I didn't say

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,970
anything because I didn't think that

00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:36,830
would really help much but uh but like

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,200
he was so irritated we'd been working

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,759
for like three hours on this problem and

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,019
we could not figure out why the data

00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:46,009
wasn't showing up where it was supposed

00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:47,840
to and I was like oh he feels like that

00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,580
too okay maybe it's alright but

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,049
sometimes I feel like that and I feel

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,899
like I'm not gonna be able to figure the

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,549
thing out um so that was great getting

00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:57,739
to see somebody else go through all

00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:59,720
those sort of emotions of code helped me

00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,129
to realize that my emotions around code

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,669
were not that crazy and we're actually

00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:06,950
fairly on track um it's also helping

00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:10,940
learned that there's so much i don't

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,830
know and i will keep learning and keep

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,539
trying and i think no matter how far I

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:18,409
go it's still going to feel like there's

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:20,509
so much that that I don't know they my

00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,950
view of all the things I could possibly

00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:24,500
learn seems to increase so much

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,200
faster than the scope of what I've

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,610
actually learned so far oh and baby

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,690
that's maybe that's okay so why am I

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:39,409
here back to that question again um I

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:42,799
don't know right I don't know if it was

00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:44,510
the right thing to have CSS be a smaller

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,880
part of what i was doing every day and

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,730
to take on writing ruby and writing

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,360
JavaScript and writing you know database

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,559
stuff and things like that and rails but

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,779
I do know that I'm having more fun than

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,000
I've had in ages that I got excited and

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,950
reinvigorated about CSS all of a sudden

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,870
it's this fun thing that gets to be my

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,370
one moment of competence in the middle

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,010
of a day where I'm doing all things that

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,450
I don't know very much about and so it

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,840
made me feel really strongly positive

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,730
about about CSS again I'm blogging about

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,700
things that I'm terrible but about you

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,139
know I a terrible at I write about Ruby

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,029
and then people write back to me and say

00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:23,600
actually totally wrong about that and

00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,940
it's horrible and also wonderful to be

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,260
in a position where I set myself up to

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:33,169
learn so much by knowing so little so

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,450
beyond that I I feel like I'm just

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,370
moving toward the things that are giving

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,919
me energy and seem interesting and

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,559
seeming gauging and what's sort of

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,450
driving me is to cut out stuff i'm not

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:49,340
interested in it anymore and to engage

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:54,019
with stuff that that feels energizing

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:56,090
for me and then to trust that you know

00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:58,039
when i look back five years from now

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,500
it's all going to seem like it fit into

00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,330
a nice row like you know i look back and

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,279
being a carpenter really has helped me

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,049
be a better web developer but at the

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,269
time when i was making the transition I

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,850
was like oh my god I can't work anymore

00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:12,889
my hands are hurt and I have no idea

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,870
what I'm gonna do i do actually need to

00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:18,200
make money and have and has like a job

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,330
and things like that so there are the

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,940
moments where you you don't know but

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,250
it's sort of trusting that ultimately it

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:29,450
all kind of works out if you follow your

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,029
heart so why are you here let's get back

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,760
to that i would say follow your heart

00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:35,720
and we will find out in those critical

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,150
life-changing moments

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,669
you so rarely know it's either critical

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,380
or life-changing follow your heart dare

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,789
to talk to someone you admire talk to

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,200
one of the speakers or somebody else

00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,419
that's here today that's done something

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,640
you think is cool get involved in an

00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,770
open source project and CSS developers

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,059
there are a lot of ugly open source

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,039
projects out there that we could make a

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,960
lot better so I think we should get

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,260
involved you know jump in and

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,159
participate more fully in the community

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,020
maybe you'll never have thought you were

00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,780
interested in SVG until you hear Chris

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,070
writes talk maybe after Chris Epstein's

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,380
talk you want to get involved in the

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,200
preprocessor community and and shape the

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,549
future of what's ass is going to do

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
maybe Connor will inspire you to find

00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:17,510
connections between product design and

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,250
the code that you write every day and

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,070
maybe summer I will make you think

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,080
differently about theming who knows why

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,120
you're here so I suggest you go out

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,100
today and discover the secret of why you

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,659
were here the thing that you couldn't

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,610
have planned for in advance because it

00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:34,309
arises out of bringing this community

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,950
together with these amazing developers

00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:40,250
an incredible set of speakers and a

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:43,250
fabulous a community of organizers that

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:45,429
put this together for you thank you very

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,429

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,130
