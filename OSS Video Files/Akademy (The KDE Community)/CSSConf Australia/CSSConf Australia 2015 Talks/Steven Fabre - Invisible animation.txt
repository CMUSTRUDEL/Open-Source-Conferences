thanks for having me here today it's

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:13,200
really awesome to be in album to talk

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:16,740
about invisible animation but before I

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,090
start I would like to give you a bit of

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:25,830
an introduction so as Fiona said my name

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:31,380
is Steven fab and I'm a product designer

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:34,739
at campaign monitor and for the past 12

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:41,000
months I've been walking on the UI and

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:46,289
UX of a product called the email builder

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,700
and when I first joined the team 12

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,750
months ago most of the year I was really

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,920
most of the guy was were already there

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,219
but it was really static he would he

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,010
would have you would abruptly change

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,900
from one state to another there was no

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:08,640
transitions new animation at all and

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,610
those abrupt changes made it very hard

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,299
for the user to register and understand

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:20,340
what was happening on the screen so

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:25,200
today in this stall I'm going to show

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,790
you how I made we made a static

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,650
interface that kind of looked like this

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,850
so you can add a layout to your email

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,759
and things abruptly change it's really

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,759
static you do it and there is no

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,490
feedback it's pretty confusing so how

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:52,220
we've changed that into something that

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:55,220
looks a bit more like like this whoa

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,220
cool

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:08,000
actually a mistake yeah cool some

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,700
animation there you click on the button

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,530
and things nicely move and it makes a

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:18,530
lot more sense it's easier to register

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:20,690
what's happening on the screen so to the

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,190
untrained eye there is not that much

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,230
difference between those two videos but

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,660
that's okay that's why that's why I'm

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,170
doing this tour today I'm basically

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,900
going to show you the thinking and walk

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:40,250
I put to those animation to get this

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:43,310
result and I'm hoping that by the end of

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,330
the talk you'll notice and appreciate

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:51,590
the subtle and almost invisible

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:53,420
animations because those animations can

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,840
significantly improve the user

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:59,000
experience of any products this product

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,570
but also the product you guys may be

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,519
working on at the moment so let me give

00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,900
you a bit of tell you what the inner

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:15,200
blur is it's it's drag and drop to that

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:19,820
we've launched about 10 months ago now

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,799
was in jun 2014 and it helps people to

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,630
design emails that will look beautiful

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:29,959
on any device and the main idea of of

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,540
that product was that we take care

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,130
campaign monitor the of the we take care

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,310
of the coding complexity that comes with

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:40,100
in our design and knew the user focuses

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,079
on what really matters the content of

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:47,560
the email and the look and feel of the

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:56,580
emails so I've made a video that

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:59,820
actually whoa so what's going on

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,080
you go so here's the email builder so I

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,940
click I'm going to change the background

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,280
color of the email so I'm going to make

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,680
it orange so it matches the CSS conf

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,620
branding and the logo in there as well

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,720
and I'm going to resize it a little bit

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,470
so it's not too big not too not too

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,100
small it just feels right and we can

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:26,700
also add a bit of text in there sir yeah

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,710
are you guys having fun and I'm going to

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,650
make that going to make that a little

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,670
bit bigger heading 1 and center it so it

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,720
looks a bit nicer and I'm also going to

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,750
add a button in there and yeah click

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,280
here if you are having fun I would click

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:50,040
there i think as I'm were you having fun

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:52,140
right now on stage and you can yeah I've

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,440
obviously add a link to it so it goes to

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,270
the CSS conf website and yeah let's have

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,310
a bit of spacing between the text in the

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,310
button so it just feels right and you

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:07,410
can even add a photo to make the signal

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:09,240
a lot more appealing right so as you man

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,620
as you might have guessed by now I'm I'm

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,360
French and we all live in Paris we all

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,580
were a stripe shirt with the barrier

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,260
carrying Baggett's and bottle of wine

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,650
that's what we all do and yeah gmail

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,770
looks good on any device and because

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,200
building email used to be really really

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,260
hard like it's insane you have to cut

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,160
tables and stuff it's really complicated

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:41,850
we created that drag and drop interface

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,810
that is really native and natural and

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,419
that's why I interaction design and

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:52,110
animations were very importance on that

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:55,380
product because we wanted people to

00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:01,350
focus on on the contents and not calling

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:04,650
very complicated emails so animation on

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,200
the web isn't is a new thing more than a

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,050
decade ago the cool train was to make

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,560
flash websites and with crazy animations

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,780
or

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,930
you would click on a button or hover

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,630
button it will bump into your face it

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,360
was a little bit insane and what's just

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:27,560
over the top and people kind of hated

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:33,139
animations a flash sorry boo-boo flash

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:37,410
and after that flash era website became

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:41,190
static again and it felt like people are

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:45,169
lit out the tendency to to get to make

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,370
the amalgam between flash and animation

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:50,479
the bad reputation of flash kind of

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:54,419
trespassed into animation territory and

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,580
that's what people think ooh animations

00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:01,290
even though we know that flash doesn't

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:04,380
mean animation at all and yeah it's only

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:08,639
five or six years ago the animation the

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,800
web when I started to surface again this

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,600
is not a myth of rock and I promise this

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,860
is going to be this will be the last gif

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,020
of this talk I'll stop after that yeah

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:26,250
that was that was interesting finding

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:28,440
that given google so yeah so faced again

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,750
and website become more and more

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,380
interactive nice hover effects as

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,539
transitions felt really nice but it felt

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:43,370
like a lot of people on list or

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:51,860
animation as something delightful nice

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:54,000
cool sexy magical splendid fun elegance

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,050
that's how people usually describe

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,580
animations but this is not the main

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,570
purpose of an animation in my opinion

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,169
don't get me wrong i really like

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,720
delightful and nice animation but i feel

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,729
like the emphasis is often put on the

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,160
animation itself rather than on

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:21,270
improving the user experience through

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:22,150
subtle and functional animations the

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,610
main

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:29,760
animation should be to improve the user

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:32,890
experience and it's only recently that

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,890
people mindset around animation study to

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,920
change toward that that approach and

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:41,890
mckelvey are from stripe the same as

00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,010
been we talked yesterday wrote a great

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,120
article explaining a whole stripe

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,510
improve the payment experience with

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,340
animation and you're going to be you're

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,300
going to be really familiar with this

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:59,200
example uses in this article has been

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,260
walked on that as well with me he'll so

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,010
that animation adds context basically

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,870
and it's clear that stripe is asking for

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,260
the phone number as part of the remember

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,600
estep and this animation is still really

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,270
nice still delightful to eating feel

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,790
right the timing is great I guess you

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,030
should know about now because Ben spoke

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,720
about that for like 10 minutes yesterday

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,370
but you can clearly see that the main

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,460
purpose of that animation was to improve

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:35,560
the user experience this is another

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:41,020
animation i really like that's when

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,570
Apple first released iOS 5 some years

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,360
ago and they introduced the camera icon

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,560
in the bottom right corner of the screen

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,950
so when I first update in my iOS to iOS

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,740
5 had no idea how i would get to the

00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,070
camera so in the first place I just

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,140
pressed the camera icon and then I saw

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,720
that bounce effect so then next time I

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,270
knew that I had to slide up to get to

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:12,100
the camera so good user experience

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:14,560
improved with animation but you have to

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,060
be careful with animations because it's

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,300
really easy to over animate things and

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,460
this is a good example of an animation

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,400
that didn't make the cut in the email

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:31,660
brother it was just was just too slow

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:34,150
and dating wasn't necessary right and it

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,529
was just without the ad because he was

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:41,730
taking too much time to the user

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:46,740
then add a layout and two years ago

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:50,709
pasco the silver wrote this article

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:53,290
called transitional interfaces which

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:56,589
shows the benefits of animation in user

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,079
interfaces and I found it really

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:02,040
inspiring and I would recommend you guys

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:06,249
to read it if you into animations and

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,519
expanded this article into a talk at wet

00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:12,249
Direction house in two thousand in

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,809
certain in Sydney and you give a great

00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:19,509
great advice there including this one

00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:21,999
good animation is invisible you

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:26,199
shouldn't notice that you're looking at

00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:29,019
animation it's quite advice that we've

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:32,499
been trying to apply on the email

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:37,480
builder you I with three key principles

00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:42,069
in mind the first one being animation

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:46,170
should improve usability animation

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:49,120
should feel natural and subtle and

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:53,110
animation should give feedback to the

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,089
user so we've tried to apply those three

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,089
principles to the email builder you I

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,670
hazel slides have taken those examples

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:08,319
from Pascal article I've shown earlier

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:12,029
where he explains basics of animation

00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,319
and easing and so on but ever really

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,199
explained that really well yesterday so

00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:20,829
I'm going to go over it three briefly so

00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:26,230
basically this is the linear approach to

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:29,470
animation and this is when it is easel

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,179
is are approaching is an approach you

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,100
can obviously tweak those two things

00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:34,899
with cubic busy and so on to make it to

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,439
fit even to make it feel a lot more

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,439
natural

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,089
so using the right easing as well as

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:47,329
finding the right timing and spacing is

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:51,160
really important and that is what makes

00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:54,250
an animation feel right and natural

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,320
although having spent the last year

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:00,199
walking on the email builder I've

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:04,490
learned that animation on the web as

00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:06,380
opposed to native apps comes with many

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:12,230
challenges that could be on finding the

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:15,529
right timing spacing or easing on the

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,829
web you cannot you cannot predict how

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:20,750
fast the device of user will be while on

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,790
native app see you kind of know like you

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,480
is always going to use the latest iPhone

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,940
or so it's probably easier to make

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,949
really perfect eating's and animation on

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,949
a device you know your user will be

00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:39,320
using so animation on the web do not do

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:42,560
not render the same on all devices and

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,199
browsers and that's what I like about

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,350
the web I like that challenge actually

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,889
and this rendering inconsistency between

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,260
browsers and devices as letters to

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:57,769
compromise things to create a good user

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,930
experience in the email builder and in

00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:03,470
fact some of the beautiful and useful

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,389
interaction on a high hand devices

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,399
didn't make it to the final product

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:10,339
because they felt read Jackie and slow

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,149
on the device or user we're more likely

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:17,120
to use so we want you to make sure that

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:20,620
animation that look like this feels

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,410
really nice bounces didn't end up

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:29,569
looking we check in slow like this on

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:32,209
low-end devices so out of all the

00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:34,579
animations and interactive prototypes we

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:39,860
put together in the design and concept

00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:41,329
stages only the most useful and

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,569
performant one made it to the final

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:47,569
products and for us it was all about

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:49,339
hand picking the most useful animations

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:51,680
and spending the time to get it just

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:56,899
right all in the end here

00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:01,550
of improving the user experience so now

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:05,540
I'm going to show you some pieces of you

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,570
I I'm going to show you how we animate

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:12,910
them so the first one is add layer

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:16,850
drop-down so the hazer looks without

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:20,570
animation click there and about the

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,910
appeals so the problem there is no

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,010
context it's not obvious that the

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,430
drop-down is being shown as part of the

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:32,270
ad layout button and the solution to

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,529
that is to animate the drop-down so it

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,690
looks like it's coming from the ad

00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:40,190
layout button and here's the result

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,140
click on a layout and the drawn down

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:50,020
nicely comes from the button and fades

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:53,690
in so this animation improves usability

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:58,100
feels natural and subtle and it gives

00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:00,980
you back to the user now here's the CSS

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:04,520
that we've used for it i simplified it a

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,070
little bit for this dog but essentially

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:12,260
we're changing the opacity of the drop

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:14,180
down from zero so it's invisible and we

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,240
scale it down to 0.2 so it looks a bit

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,570
small and we translate it on the y-axis

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,150
so by thirty-seven percent so it looks

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,540
like it's coming from where the button

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,640
is and then when the user clicks the

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,339
button we trigger a class on that rub

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,320
down layout and over some way nice

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,800
transitions with easing and so on which

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm not really covering here we change

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,660
the value from opacity 0 to 1 and we

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,120
transform its scale from zero point two

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,520
to one and we translated it to its final

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,260
position so that's why you get this nice

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:57,890
animation the second piece of your eye

00:16:51,260 --> 00:17:02,860
is the sidebar accordion so when you

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,860
click on the logo there things just

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,750
abruptly appear and it's really

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:14,350
confusing so the problem here is it

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:18,339
feels pretty abrupt it's not clear what

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:22,210
the image texts and non labels mean and

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:25,030
relay to the solution is animate the

00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:29,080
accordions contents show the image text

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,960
no labels after a little delay so when

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,570
I'm talking about label labels that's

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,180
the three-tails next to logo up there

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,980
that appears after a little delay so

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:49,540
it's it's we clear that those labels are

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:53,370
related to the content and the naiads so

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:58,510
this animation feels improves usability

00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:11,110
feels natural and subtle and gives

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:13,690
feedback to the user cool is the CSS for

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:18,100
it so hey I'm just talking about the

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:21,550
arkonians contents so as you can see it

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:26,800
kind of comes in and scale up a little

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:29,890
bit so simple CSS put opacity 0 by

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,130
default scale to 0.9 so it's a little

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:37,170
bit smaller and over a nice transitions

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,400
with rum cubic Bezier aging and stuff we

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:45,670
transform it to opacity 1 and scale it

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:47,740
to one and about the labels up there by

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,520
default they're not visible opacity 0

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,100
and same as the ad layout drop down a

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,690
shaman earlier they just come in from 15

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,190
pixel so you can't really see them the

00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,190
underneath it and then they come at

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,910
third piece of UI button button state so

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,550
in the public version of the email

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,860
bruder you can when you've designed your

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,010
email you can download the files at the

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,380
end

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:19,100
and you just need to enter your email

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:22,430
there and then you press send me the

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,290
files and yeah you're just hoping for

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,900
the best you're going to receive you

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,570
ain't no with the files but it's really

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,670
confusing here there's no feedback user

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,120
doesn't know if pressing the button

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,700
actually did something and the solution

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,420
is to tell the user what's happening

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,280
behind the theme so actually that's

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,410
actually very similar to the similar to

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:54,380
the stripe animation that been shown

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:59,930
yesterday that's that's the result I in

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:02,210
turn email and when i press send me the

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:04,220
file we just changing the state of the

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,050
button so it says sending me email we're

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,160
giving feedback to the user and after a

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:13,730
little delay we just show this tick icon

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,670
that means yeah it's been sent and this

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,290
is all I again we don't really know if

00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,120
if that email has been sent by it's

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,390
really likely that it has been sent and

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,740
it makes the user feel comfortable in

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,140
those what's happening behind the scene

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:33,170
I think he knows because that's a lie

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:37,300
but that's good and yeah that's improved

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:41,660
usability feels natural and subtle and

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:45,770
gives feedback to the user and here's

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,830
the CSS for it simplified again by

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,350
default the button is green and when we

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,450
add a disabled class to that button we

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,390
change its style so it looks disabled

00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:02,510
becomes gray and after two seconds of

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:06,710
delay we just move the scent the success

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:09,430
icon from 30 pixel to 0 so it looks this

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,430
coming from the top

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:18,870
a layout controllers is our height looks

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,539
I should actually give you a bit of

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,600
background on this one so in the email

00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:28,139
brother you can you can add a bunch of

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,440
layouts to your email and you have the

00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:33,659
option to yeah just throw those

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,659
controllers to move the layouts around

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,850
up and downs and you can also duplicate

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:41,820
this layer when you click on the COG

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,610
icon or delete that layout so that's

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,860
that's what those controllers do the

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,580
problem here is that it's not obvious

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:55,139
that the controllers control the layout

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:56,879
that is being offered the solution was

00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:58,769
to make the controls come from the

00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:01,529
layout they control and over this is a

00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:10,409
really really subtle animation but it's

00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:13,139
really improved user experience it's

00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,429
really subtle they're coming from from

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:18,809
the left now they're coming from the

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:24,419
layout instead of just appearing hover

00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:26,909
and they come from the left so that

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:30,860
improves usability feels natural and

00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,860
settle and it gives feedback to the user

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:39,590
and pretty simple CSS is just translate

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,590
my necessary to pixel 20 when you hover

00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:47,960
ads or duplicate a layout so

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,840
that's that's how it looks when you add

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,150
a new layout just the layout just it

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,880
feels really approved today out of the

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:05,840
page suddenly changed it's really

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,890
confusing and the solution is to make

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,890
the new layout previously via

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:18,070
progressively up here with animation and

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:21,470
so he is the outcome that drag it and

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:24,440
the layout kind of comes in and fades in

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,740
and feels way nicer and it's improved

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,320
user experience and performance was

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,020
something we had to look at well and it

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:38,179
had to film for fast not slow in jerky

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:41,570
again that improves usability it feels

00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:47,929
natural and subtle and it gives feedback

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:50,090
to the user hey is the CSS for it same

00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:54,620
principle by default the opacity is set

00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:59,179
to zero and it's killed is set to 0.7 so

00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:01,640
it's a bit smaller and when we add this

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:07,549
layout to the Dom we change its opacity

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:10,340
to one and we scale it one and it is a

00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:13,130
bit of a wheel thing happening here I'm

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,370
sure you guys have have noticed how do

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:19,850
we know this new layout is going to be

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:23,330
1500 pixel height so we're using that

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,669
property to do this this transition

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:29,480
where the everything moves down when we

00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:32,179
add that new layout and actually in one

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,330
of the prototype we've we've done in the

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,100
first stages we were dynamically

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,950
calculating the height of those new

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,160
layouts and that we could have the

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:46,100
perfect easing very nice timing and it

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,390
felt very great on this computer right

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:54,500
here was amazing fast good animation but

00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:57,890
when we tested that on on low-end

00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,140
devices or some of the device or user

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,620
were most likely to use

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:08,720
fell that very Jackie and slower like so

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:11,390
that's a compromise we went for and the

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,300
animation is not as nice the easing is

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,250
not perfect perfect but it was still a

00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,500
great outcome and the user experience

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:23,150
was improved for everyone here's the

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,630
last piece of animation I'm going to

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:31,910
show you today which is delete a layout

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:35,240
here's how it looks did it boom just

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,830
disappeared pretty pretty confusing

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,500
especially if you have really similar

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:42,710
layouts in your email you don't know

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,510
what you've just deleted it if it's

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,380
really abrupt it's not clear that the

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:52,630
layout has been deleted solution make

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:58,280
the layout progressively disappear and

00:25:52,630 --> 00:26:02,240
he is G is what we've done click on

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:06,620
delete confirm and fades out and then

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,970
all the other layouts come up so when

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,330
the email contains a lot of similar

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:14,060
error or almost identical layouts this

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:17,330
animation becomes even more useful it

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,600
shows what layout has been deleted by

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,000
sliding up the content of the email so

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,340
it improves visibility feels natural and

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:32,660
subtle and it gives feedback to the user

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:34,120
and yeah CSS pretty simple again please

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,490
similar to what I've shown you earlier

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,470
which ended sub the opacity of that

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:42,260
layout from 1 to 0 and we scale it from

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,260
120 per night with some really nice

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:51,010
transitions using using cubic Bezier and

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:54,530
so on so by now you should hopefully

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,940
appreciate those subtle changes I've

00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:01,120
shown you in the video at the beginning

00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,120
of the talk so I'm gonna play it again

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:18,630
yeah cool feels much much nicer now and

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,940
the user experience is improved so

00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,150
that's does animation as really subtle

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:29,250
almost invisible but they definitely

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:31,230
improve the user experience so I'm sure

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,450
the best motion designers out there

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,860
would easily point out how those

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:39,420
animation could be improved but

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:43,500
animation on the web comes with

00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:45,480
compromise and it's true there's a lot

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:51,660
we could have done around bouncing and

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,210
easing and timing etc but we had to drop

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,790
those in some cases because it wasn't

00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:01,380
fast enough on a device or user we're

00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:02,940
more likely to use that's okay it's a

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,730
conscious conscious decision we've made

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:09,480
to provide the best user experience

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:12,150
across devices and they still a lot you

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,830
can do on the web to create great

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:21,120
animation there's just one little thing

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,940
I wish we could we could do nowadays

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,530
everyone is talking about progressive

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,910
enhancement Scott was talking about that

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:31,850
yesterday and responsive design so you

00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,500
deliver the right content to the right

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,840
device and depending on the connection

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,480
and a lot of things we enhance the

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:43,080
experience but those principles could

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,140
apply to animation too so I was

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,190
wondering I think would be great if we

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:53,490
could do responsive animation and be

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,850
able to create different different

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,250
animation based on some major Curie or

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:02,730
something so you can tell if the device

00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:06,030
is slow or fast and enhance the

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,650
experience for the user that that are

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,390
lucky enough to have a great computer

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:14,260
and fast connection

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,450
so I had a look and media queries for

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:20,110
seem to have an option to detect if a

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:26,220
device is slow by using the update

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:29,770
frequency property and you can target

00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,720
with major Curie slow devices so that's

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,880
something we could hopefully use that

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,320
seems like a good solution but I'm

00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,560
really hoping that someone we come up

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,600
with something a bit more robust and

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,190
yeah I'm keen to hear your fault after

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:48,070
the talk if you have any idea how we

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:50,800
could achieve that um anyway I'm seeing

00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:53,680
more and more people talking speaking

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,590
designing interfaces with animation

00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:01,750
doesn't mean that you should animate all

00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:03,790
the things and if if I've done my job

00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,930
right you should notice you shouldn't

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:15,160
notice the animation shown earlier while

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:18,060
using the email brother so oh let's good

00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,060
let up cool

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,799
invisible that's how animation should be

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:30,289
and I've wrote an article originally

00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:31,669
called invisible animation so you can

00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,919
have a look at that if you want and

00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,830
there's a link as well to go to the

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,970
campaign monitors email Twitter and if

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,789
you want to contact me and talked about

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,000
animation yeah my details thank you very

00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:43,000
