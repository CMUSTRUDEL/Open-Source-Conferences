see a CSS for humans what's this all

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,360
about so Mel touched a little bit on

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,440
thick and what we do as an agency and I

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,150
just wanted to talk a little bit about

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,160
that first just to give us some context

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,420
for we're talking about a color of our

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,609
projects today sand the work we've done

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,960
with the state government and we do try

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,449
and do work that has a positive social

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
impact we're a big hope if you've heard

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,300
of that the idea is that you can be a

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,119
business that makes money without

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,289
ruining the planet that's okay and we

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,029
kind of encourage other people to do the

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,430
same thing we give five percent of our

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,930
revenue or weight of charities and just

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,280
in the last week a lot of other studios

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,380
around town I've started doing the same

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,239
thing which is really inspiring and has

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,480
been fantastic for us to see that side

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,670
to heaven I'm going to be around for the

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
next couple of days couple of our other

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,039
dead guys are here give us a wave so if

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,039
you have any questions seek them out and

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,930
we can have a chat so you're getting a

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,820
lot of sort of quite technical talks at

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,640
this conference this isn't one of them

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,350
this isn't that how talk a lot of the

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,760
guides are talking through over the next

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,320
couple of days going to cut a lot of the

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,140
things that I'm going to be introducing

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,840
but in a lot more detail really I don't

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,780
have a lot of code it's not a CSS talk

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,909
as such I want to give a why talk I want

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,080
to talk about I guess why I work is

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,479
important and how we can make a

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,970
difference so who else works at an

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,850
agency here let's get your hand up yeah

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,330
cool what about at a product company or

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,450
a start-up nice it's a lot of you in the

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,939
house a big corporate or you know for

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,159
the government even what about students

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,460
self-employed people contractors people

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,350
like that cool so that's who pays you

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,060
that's your job but you will actually

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,590
work for people you work for the people

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,780
that are using the stuff that you're

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,880
creating and you're the ultimate

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,340
responsibility and whether that's good

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,420
and whether it's easy to use or not if

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,549
you talk about human computer

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,439
interaction you define the computer side

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,149
of it it's up to you guys the determine

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,930
if something is good that's why you're

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,790
at CSS conf not API conf you know so

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,590
just to put this a little bit of context

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,009
so I want to take us back back to the

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,009
90s

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,110
so I got my start writing CSS it looked

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,450
a bit like this font size 16px

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,640
line-height 24px it's pretty normal

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,160
stuff obviously pixels aren't great but

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,360
that's what we had and I was really

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,459
excited about the internet it was a

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,870
platform for publishing for sharing for

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,430
telling people what we were doing and

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,690
getting her thoughts out there and

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,170
everyone could share everyone was equal

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,540
it was really cool now of course that

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,340
that style that was on an inline style

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,050
which is not great you know I mean it's

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,709
very vogue again now but at the time

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,480
wasn't cool and it wasn't line style on

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,620
a font tag because we had to have a bit

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,170
of a fullback you know you had to

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,070
support those other browsers and this is

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,239
the sort of thing we were hacking away

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:53,280
at and really it looks pretty crude but

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,650
the way we used to make line height we

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,050
had a 24 pixel hi gif and we put that in

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,880
every eight or nine words you know in ad

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,350
copy to make those lines taller so its

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,090
CSS was a pretty big deal it was a

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,780
pretty big improvement we're all really

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,030
excited about it obviously the classical

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,560
definition separating content from

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,780
presentation what that really meant for

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,950
us as practitioners we could make the

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,600
web beautiful we could make these

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,430
interfaces really nice really easy to

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,209
use we could bring a little bit of

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,220
design and art to the work we were doing

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,360
it gave control to users and this has

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,489
been lost a little bit this is one of

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,410
the big themes for me today is that

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,690
people who experience the the web in

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,820
different ways COCs gave them a later to

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,459
find that have a minimum font size to

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,840
change contrast to fix some of the

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,440
cruddy websites that were coming up

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,570
against and lettuce designed for context

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,799
this is really important as well you

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,810
know you print something a look at

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,280
servant when you view on screen this is

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,900
the kind of thinking that meant we were

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,549
actually set up to do responsive design

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,400
before we needed we need to do it so

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,459
that was pretty exciting and a lots

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,049
happened since specular days our focus

00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,400
is a bit different now things have

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,769
happened there's Facebook and Twitter

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,100
and social networks there's the iphone

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,510
the app store things like uber and what

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,220
are we here for now we're talking about

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,260
can we have a start-up can we make the

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,549
most money can we ship the tightest code

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,310
can we have the best gifts in our

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,049
presentation and when I go to a lot of

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,340
meetups and stuff around town and look

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,380
at what's happening internationally a

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,700
lot of people's talks are really focused

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,190
on tooling and

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,900
things that help us make our work but

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,160
really why are we just talking about

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,130
that all the time why don't we talking

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,040
about who the stuff is for because we're

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,390
at a point now it's 2015 the web okay

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,850
it's a playground somewhere to hack away

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,050
and have fun somewhere that you might

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,420
get to be a millionaire which is awesome

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,950
but at the end of the day the web's an

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,590
essential service it's like electricity

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,560
or coffee that people need to live their

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,850
lives and get stuff done as I say here

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,350
getting something done on the web it's

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,800
not a choice it's often the only way you

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,450
can do something so we ran a project

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,700
last year where we learned a lot more

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,500
about this it was officially called the

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,750
Victorian Government transaction reform

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,370
project we just called it services

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,080
because that's what it was it was how

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,390
the state government can provide their

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,910
services to people and we ran a sort of

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,020
research exercise to find out how people

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,450
are interacting with the government what

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,950
he needs were we built these shops it

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,660
was one of the city and one out in the

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,430
country in shippuden and we had about

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,620
eight weeks to do that so how do we

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,000
build a shop in eight weeks well same

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,910
way we build anything in a hurry would

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,910
kind of bitter 8 lbs until the Cardinal

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:31,950
shops to do and all of our UX design

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,320
test in a week or we made all that and

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,910
comments were actually real but live as

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,200
such and as a chance that array

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,930
finalized that work

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,730
that meant that we want to ride how to

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,310
erection thinking about how I'm going to

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,020
be using attitude we're going to build

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,140
it this really really elegant lot like

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,970
win more fun and entering government we

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,700
find a transaction and you looking for

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,340
me types and find your resultant I what

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,490
you can get it dug this was really slim

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,560
these of you sounds good result but was

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,900
ticking people off sir some like this

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,840
there's a website and bonus the beating

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,360
reputation anyone up the back can't see

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,770
it let's quickly look at you I see a bit

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,720
funnier and there's a picture of being

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,600
on there that's actually the capture

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,430
this is how many bees are you choose can

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,730
drop down a little bit like one of us

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,740
nightmare run making up songs on the

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:35,190
roads of that is anyone from us take up

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:37,980
in here but it someone who heads our old

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,130
job our responsibility bags and

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,600
that's going to be right so we are going

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,000
to find a lot of issues like that a lot

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,970
of miles on sides most up we would apply

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,060
right next one one man out of the

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,590
research we got out of this project

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,730
since ETO the customers who feel that my

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,509
life form had to print something out

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,479
yeah

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:04,539
so we were the severing a lot about

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,919
don't have a choice that medication like

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,779
you don't have an option when you know

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,189
the government to fill out and can't not

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,169
when your driver's license you have to

00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:15,709
get to work captain I'll get very little

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:18,769
you're not married right so all these

00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,479
things in a riddle present a real fact

00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,979
of it maybe was experience is quite

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,739
different maybe quite stresses the

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:26,479
people they were never into tire size

00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:29,749
how to use they couldn't get affordable

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,999
there and I won't talk to have no fear

00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,039
that people working on a product you'd

00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:36,679
love up to me at the mandatory safe

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,719
flight booking happen or do if I fax

00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:41,989
people going to use your activities if

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:43,699
you want to be there are collectible so

00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:46,099
a lot of the research we were doing some

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,139
variation in traditional stuff if you

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:51,139
want we'll use this model or the

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:54,409
difference or actually the score out in

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:57,019
when you recommend is you would you bite

00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,699
the area will you tell us if you go to

00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:02,209
our online store must leave you

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:05,209
wondering whether I can take upon them

00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:08,749
the link the negative it will be tricky

00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:10,459
to study we start out in the world using

00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:13,459
some lightness to evaluate how well they

00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:15,679
go out of mainly uses these but in this

00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:18,139
situation we know her choice there was a

00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:19,819
ransom server from fish to ask for

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,269
people we care about this that'll work

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,739
and we'll have do a little their own you

00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,209
know I have to do that remember

00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:27,820
expectations we will pleasantly

00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:31,630
surprised at the Democrats

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,450
with not what is holding these services

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,690
to the same understand they call the

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,330
sidewalk and if I was like I'm worried

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,010
about this works the few wouldn't know

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,830
though I don't know where they're like

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,020
stuck my Twitter the photos hi there so

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,020
it becomes really important removing

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,840
it'll bury people getting stuff that we

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,700
basically sum it up I said so there are

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,530
customer satisfaction a people happy

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,820
with a sudden they have to do it's a

00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,560
well known by everyone was actually

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,330
saying they were having whether they got

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,450
this transaction they would or not and

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,310
this applies in fact delight as well one

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,750
of the people we spoke with that we

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,340
interviewed now research she doesn't

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,830
have a sinner she's from the culture

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,960
where people's names relatively so she

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,970
just has a first name that's that's her

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,790
so when she came to fill out any form

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,870
online partisan she couldn't get past

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,520
that Thursday's sir as a mandatory field

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,410
and I think you are there for weighing

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,650
up does the government make enough noise

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:35,650
efficient viruses strolling 16 thank you

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:37,750
see that's that's what a nice day so we

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,480
knew there were some problems that we

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,190
also witness either the Volusion the

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,110
redesign business ettore website

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,620
launched grab at the site last erection

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,690
and this was a really good result for us

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,180
under the beach mat now is everything

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,880
talk about the space things that happy

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,360
or business Victoria very popular

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,980
websites

00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,149
yeah if you're starting a new business

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,519
it's where you go to get your business

00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,350
name registered secure if you want a

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
business make a fire actually you

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,160
employees me what your policy should be

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,800
it's the number one was often doing

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,570
things like they like sailing holidays

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,040
inventory of the cch confirmation

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,839
thinking about so it's not the most

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,720
websites around and it's not really well

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,269
for us in the case study so many people

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,490
consistently community was struggling

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,140
for stuff they are we have whether they

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,940
said it doesn't look like a government

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,360
website how do you guys do that that's

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,820
really exciting it's not right maybe you

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,170
do anything new or innovative with a bit

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,399
of negative feedback as well I don't

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,160
like our website people with the gun but

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,709
themselves my child-wife sometimes with

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,820
bow bear Pacific's so big it's simple

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:53,480
it's Charlie I just say yeah you know it

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,880
was happy about there so how do we get

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
to the spine they're a bit of strife of

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,620
getting customer feedback coming aaron

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,570
King saying overwhelming using was

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,220
actually easier than the phone and all

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,420
the hell dish that was the digital

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,490
website it's the data side right and the

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,440
cold like this Stewart 1855

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,329
decision-making points on Iron Age which

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,430
is not fun especially using a screen

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,620
reader towards the wall there or if you

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,769
have paid your own without your phone is

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,350
not responsive and really the city to

00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,390
the trap

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,060
two most popular things on their own age

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:33,390
down there in the way over box tomorrow

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:35,460
but had a carousel the stakeholders are

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,220
all happy they have primary angry or

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,840
safe what to read ten thousand verses 14

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,180
Tomic really cool and the content pages

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,700
they weren't much caviar items like oh

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,850
my god you guys are all you know arias

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,830
whoa that's operate but this happen I'm

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,560
nervous someone did this intentionally

00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,570
right the sovereign against weed to come

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,920
in and can't solve the processes thing

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,690
change things understand their so Cody

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,720
was kind of fine with this cloak and

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,460
Arab director what we designed for

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,220
attention to itself it should allow

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,080
people how much the task of us in the

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,750
most efficient manner possible and

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,150
assess it will be invisible so how do we

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,920
make no invisible web site and but i'm

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,600
not trolling the night when we talk

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,630
about animation an excellent by they

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,700
have this hella days one poking out is

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,920
how the universe night megan are my

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,630
priority making that part of development

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:36,060
is responsibility so first we just went

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,160
out and spoke room as a steal we're a

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,030
research-driven alright i'm looking at

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,530
sort of half as me full time researchers

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,750
think this is we do to developers and

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,110
they go out enemy people get one for the

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,570
05 ability the some of the key are

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,240
externally should face the sort of the

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:59,010
matrix has emotional cottage physical

00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,360
context context and so we are edgy it

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,700
was clear explore this may be nothing or

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,580
this environment I hear what I said

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,810
nothing else you could just showed you

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,300
how to bring up as I find you so what

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,380
people want

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:24,110
the tags and yet when I should order any

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:28,920
you can color blind spot but this was

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,620
when I decided to use yeah simple Melvin

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,100
see it sticking around and everything

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,420
kind of feels good remember right place

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,890
they're about two thousand thousand

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:52,790
people we got stabbed about fun so it's

00:13:40,890 --> 00:14:00,050
an American so there's four ashes I know

00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:07,100
skipping out we love love like 60 years

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:10,970
something looks like the stickers back

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,410
we sorted hold up bring us about I guess

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:18,870
what you think we kind of like get

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:22,530
divided into the car is sort of a

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,200
challenge our government sucks I in

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:28,040
there any reason revolution what it is

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,110
we co-designer together we were there

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,220
this is a show about Warren the office

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,589
and all the research

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,410
sure the rugged happened on site with

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:44,370
the fireman in space they were all

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:48,120
deeply people all the all the restrictor

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:51,240
things I study uses their Caribbean

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,819
otherwise would even a variant of

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,189
sonship people are safe like that pop

00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:59,540
smaller given by color and those

00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:02,100
pictures other people that want a new I

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,470
understand are we know this right you're

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,970
singing using this you know the decision

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:12,059
for us that's why they don't have

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:16,379
hydrogen and co-creation process and the

00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:18,600
streaming porn websites this will be

00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:23,430
real obviously this double standards

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,999
with iOS but he can't do it sicily

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:30,889
juicing for the browser's i just have

00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:34,649
given I really will depart really order

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:38,309
we know this you know why triangle site

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:41,430
a lot of pilots my skill to perform

00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:44,309
whenever and wherever stand together

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,689
diamond use for them in the river sites

00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:51,779
where although miserliness initially

00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:55,279
this which mean really bit really where

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,279
these real names on our

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,260
so we eliminated all of the confusion on

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,060
the site this was really important you

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,680
know there was a lot going on you know

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,720
where to go there's those wireframes

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,250
again so everything that was on that

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,470
page had a purpose it had a meeting

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,450
there was a title what you can do there

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,670
why it's important what the

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,990
prerequisites were if you were on the

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,700
wrong page because you'd come in from a

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,090
google search we had the most relevant

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,040
stuff right there some helpful tips and

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,450
you know real human advice and we've got

00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,250
rid of all the cognitive overhead we

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,080
made the site really simple really use

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,410
you knew what was going on when you

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,959
arrive there which was important and

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,310
crucially we made it fast we talked

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,170
about performance as a feature there's

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,270
real time loading which is nice it was

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,470
72 bus in faster than it was before we

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,199
get our hands on it which is really good

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:19,110
and as well as page load and page speed

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,610
we talked a lot about time to content so

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,470
we've gotten rid of all of the sort of

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,300
intermediate pages there's no landing

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,640
pages or section breakdowns it's just

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,000
nav nav nav until you had content which

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,620
is really quite exciting so it was good

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,770
don't everyone go there at once to check

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,420
it out slow down if you did would know

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,070
about it because we've got tools like

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,480
calibre when the government does

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,890
something weird like putting a pop-up

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,080
window on it because it's an election to

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,700
warn people there's an election we can

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,650
see the impact they had on performance

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,030
and the difference it made to load times

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,150
things like that we're using caliber

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,950
thanks Ben you've really helped us out

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,000
with this one it's been a great tool you

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,710
can see it's loading in a couple of

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,940
seconds which is pretty remarkable for

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:02,160
gov site so that was our projects we

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,540
learned a lot from those two but walking

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,490
out of here when you guys go out in the

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,170
world what are going to give you what

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,070
are the tools what I want you to focus

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,390
on to

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,650
make sites better for people when you're

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,880
doing your work when you're being a

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,860
front-end engineer when you're writing

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,270
code what should you be thinking about

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,750
is part of this bigger picture that

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:21,090
makes life better for people first of

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,700
all user experience yeah it's a trendy

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,220
word it's also everyone's job like

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,570
especially yours this is a old chart I

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,230
just pulled off the first article I

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,570
found googling for web team all chart

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,640
sorry whoever this was and it's got a

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,380
you know structure there's design people

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,380
its content people is developer people

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,910
and there's your UX design person down

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,280
there right that's that's someone's job

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,720
in a box and often what you see

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,000
happening is that someone does something

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,320
it's a Photoshop file they give it to

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,760
someone like us and we're trying to I'm

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,090
going to cut that up exactly like you

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,870
gave me right I'm a really good CSS guy

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,630
but that's not really what it's about

00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,490
but we want everyone to be a UX person

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,440
you should be a UX engineer aux

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,940
developer everyone should kind of have

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,680
that hat on during a project and you

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,180
should be able to speak up and say hey I

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,070
don't know if this is right and we got

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,610
some testing here we got some research

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,170
can we prove this is good or not at big

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,150
companies a big corporates often what

00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,060
happens is that there's a some sort of

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,190
approval is a gateway UX happens someone

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,320
wants to sign off on a static thing and

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,580
then they want to see that exact same

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,680
thing at the end of the process and

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,850
that's not right at all we know we've

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,980
got to get stuff in front of real people

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,600
and have them use it first we can't

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,800
settle the old way of doing things

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,250
otherwise it's going to be bad for

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,470
people to use accessibility this is a

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,270
really big deal with government projects

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,860
there's a concept called assisted

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,560
digital which is about getting everyone

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,030
to be able to use a web service and it

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,950
literally everyone like there's no edge

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,940
cases everyone needs to be able to use

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,770
this thing and they get their

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,600
information into the web service somehow

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,980
if they have to have a hand doing that

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,390
if someone's doing some directly with

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,420
them but they're still using that web

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,710
service and it needs the cater for them

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,390
I've been collecting a few tweets from

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,530
people are follow I haven't gone digging

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,140
for these little literally just things

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,610
that popped up in my timeline this is my

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,620
friend Joanna from the New Zealand

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,910
government and she's saying that year

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,770
the most frequent users of government

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,630
services are people that have poor

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,340
digital literacy they don't really

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,350
understand what's going on stuff is hard

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,760
for them so that's why we need to make

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,929
this things easy to use affordance if

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,759
you know what that means it's all

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,440
where stuff is on the screen doesn't

00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,179
make sense is that a button is that a

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,409
button is the stuff sensible easy to use

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,960
you need to be angry about things that

00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:35,340
don't make sense that's kind of why I do

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,929
what I do today I've had a bad

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,269
experience trying to apply for a my key

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,529
card and I'm like this could be a lot

00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:42,570
better so I wrote them an angry letter

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:46,289
and I've been thinking about service

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,909
design ever since so you can't you can't

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,700
let bad stuff happen you don't want to

00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,009
be a hashtag bad UX person and really

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,049
we're the Gateway to that we can stop

00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,779
the stuff going out as it happens a

00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,799
really big point is around you're going

00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,919
to talk you know here guys talking about

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,570
modular CSS things like that if you

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,999
develop a style guide if you solve these

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,950
problems once you've you've kind of done

00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,629
the hard work for everyone else you need

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,639
to actually make that available share it

00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:13,350
encourage your clients to work that way

00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:15,389
have modules have things they can share

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,860
around their organization so they're not

00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:18,480
just paying the next agency the same

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,070
money they paid you to come in and do

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,659
the same way you can actually solve this

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,940
and get it into production and make it

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,860
make it real the government especially

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,059
they've got the same problems all the

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,379
time we could actually give them an

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,559
open-source piece of kit they could be

00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:33,840
using and reusing there's my friend Dean

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,179
he's saying yep ask me a question but

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,379
give me one option that's scumbag UX you

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,759
know don't let the sort of thing happen

00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,409
really important thing is performance

00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,210
and this might be the ultimate because

00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:47,190
it literally does affect everyone not

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,600
just your the things I haven't once in

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,980
awhile it matters to every when it comes

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,379
to your site it's not just about waiting

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,759
for some to load who's on their phone

00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,600
today right worried about the battery

00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,669
going to run out this is because

00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,240
websites are pushing too much data down

00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:02,399
your antenna you know so big thing to do

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,749
is set a performance budget who's doing

00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:06,360
that already who's thinks about

00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:07,889
performance budgets on their site right

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,710
that's good this is something you should

00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:12,119
all be involved in we actually signed a

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,029
contract for support with the business

00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,470
Victoria that says we've got a minimum

00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,519
PageSpeed score and load time and that's

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,869
something you can actually start

00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,600
thinking about doing as part of a

00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:23,639
project to make it really visible it

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,960
helps explain the real cost of changes

00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:26,789
and when people do slap some of that

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,029
marketing on your homepage how it slows

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:31,799
your site down measure what matters like

00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,299
we spoke about did it work or not that

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,280
things like that should be a primary

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,740
goal beyond just you know

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,090
the really complex stuff think about the

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,380
most important stuff first and measure

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,310
what counts are people getting stuff

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,470
done on your site if we all shave one

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,030
second off the next thing we shipped but

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,080
imagine the collective difference that

00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,730
would make the amount of people are

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,570
going to be using that it's really

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,130
something to think about and the people

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,390
paying for your work they actually care

00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,980
about performance they might be a little

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,960
bit iffy about accessibility that might

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,970
take some arguing but they're going to

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,800
understand this this is a nugget from

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,510
respond come from Sydney last week

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,060
thanks Peter for picking this one out

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,740
for me so your senior said users will go

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,140
to a competitor's website if it saves

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,610
them 250 milliseconds so that's a

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,170
quarter of a second that's that's a

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,400
tangible difference meget of people when

00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,680
they're making a decision where to go

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,090
online so people will actually respond

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,950
to that and they will support you to

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:27,300
make changes that makes things perform

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,010
better testing this is a big one tizen

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,600
with accessibility as well there was

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,730
really good article on a list apart last

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,440
month by an Gibson it's called reframing

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,900
accessibility if you haven't read that

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,090
go and read that when you get home it's

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,430
really powerful stuff and it talks again

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,560
about there's no edge cases you know you

00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,030
have to support everything people going

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,220
to use phones they're going to use TVs

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,230
they're going to use IE 8 they're going

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,040
to use weird devices like that to get on

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,120
your website you need to deal with them

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,790
support everything support all the

00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:01,200
things here's miles miles was trying to

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:03,750
do as tax on a Mac not good literally

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,640
says message equals failed to load

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,370
keystore maybe read only error code

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,380
equals 4 402 and there's a cancel button

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:15,420
so he's done his throne is computer out

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:17,010
the window so yeah ultimately what I

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,590
want you guys to take away it's about

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,690
your impact every hour you spend making

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,850
the web faster more accessible and easy

00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,220
to use for people that turns into days

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:32,270
like real time save by real people and

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:35,760
that's that's my key point I think yeah

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:38,310
that's US sir thanks everyone you canít

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,200
me up on Twitter at sox these slides

00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,090
will be online i'll publish them after

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,070
this if you want know more about thick

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,020
or be corpse or sort of doing work for

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,020
