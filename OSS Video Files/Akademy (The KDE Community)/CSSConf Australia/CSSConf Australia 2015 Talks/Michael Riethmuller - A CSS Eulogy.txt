I Mike I'm a web developer do you have

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,630
any other web developers here no oh okay

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,679
well good because the second half of

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,570
this talk is actually going to be about

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,160
farming so I work with the australian

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,560
government and in the first talk today

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,140
matt said he showed you a picture of a

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,019
government homepage and he said someone

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,939
designed this and i couldn't help but

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,250
think to myself will no actually 80

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,570
people design that so that's kind of

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,059
what I do at my day job and I do the

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,500
best that I can to make those websites

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,940
accessible for people and that can get

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,040
quite stressful at times so when I'm not

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,390
doing that I like to experiment with

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,000
code and experimenting is one of my

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,300
favorite things you can find some of my

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,500
half-baked ideas on code pen or github

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,129
and occasionally I write something a bit

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,329
more detailed on my blog also as part of

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,870
the deal working for government I need

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,270
to say that I'm here independently but

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,710
that of course goes both ways so if

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,180
there are any decisions you guys don't

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,930
like the chances are it probably wasn't

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,470
consulted either we can cut that out of

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,470
the video right

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,070
okay so if you haven't seen the title of

00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:21,490
my talk it's a CSS eulogy so thank you

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,500
all for coming a somber occasion it's

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,030
not a eulogy for CSS itself although the

00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,289
landscape is certainly changing and

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,360
that's something I want to touch on I

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:31,149
don't think we're saying goodbye to CSS

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,679
anytime soon rather this talk is about

00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:34,270
reflecting on some of the patterns and

00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:36,280
techniques that we regularly use and

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,670
asking ourselves is this really the best

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,450
way or if things moved on and

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,970
surprisingly the answer to that might

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,700
not always be obvious I'll be honest

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,720
it's not going to be easy we're going to

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,119
be laying to rest some much-loved

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,670
patterns and designs ones that have

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,520
served as well over the years so lean on

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,020
the people around you if you need be

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,789
prepared to reflect on negative margins

00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,890
lament your love of creature tsk Lear

00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,500
fixes Andrew the days before pixel-based

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,899
certainty will also be acknowledging

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,670
flexbox viewport units and CSS

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,649
transforms among other worthy newcomers

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,660
to carry the legacy of techniques that

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,829
came before them and finally in the

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,420
course of this I hope to demonstrate

00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:17,260
some methods that you can use now that

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,260
will help you move on as you know things

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,549
in our industry move quickly and legacy

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,920
something we're constantly dealing with

00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,780
as a result we don't always move on as

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,430
quick as we should often we cling to

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,920
outdated techniques it's either out of

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,470
fear or comfort and I want to say it's

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,299
okay to not want to let go in the dying

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,859
days of 86 and seven despite our rocky

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:37,540
relationship I often found myself

00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:40,030
reaching for the comfort of a robust

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,430
stock and to this day where inline-block

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,450
is concerned in my heart zoom will

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,700
always be one what I'm getting at is

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,590
like anything else our habits when

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,209
writing CSS can become ingrained and do

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,519
be able to change even though we might

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,780
know better and I think what's needed is

00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,350
some proper acknowledgement of this so

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,060
that we can all grieve and move on so

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,440
cherish the memories as we say goodbye

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,540
to one of our fondest friends the

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,950
clerics and I think you all know what

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,549
I'm talking about when I say a clinics

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,370
it's a hack to make a container self

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,930
clear it's floated children and it is of

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,819
course an incredibly versatile hack and

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,380
one that underpins a lot of patterns we

00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,440
use today including media objects

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,410
navigations and grits in fact we use it

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,699
so often that we forget it's a hack but

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,960
if you've ever tried to explain what a

00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,550
clearfix is to someone who doesn't

00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,060
you might have realized that it actually

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,130
makes very little sense although it may

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,810
seem like second nature floats were

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,210
never meant for solving the majority of

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,920
problems we asked them to solve and they

00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,550
require hacks like clearfix to make them

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,650
work why should we have to do this is a

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,300
perfectly reasonable question and we've

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,490
come to accept that this is maybe the de

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,620
facto way to solve this problem no more

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,230
thinking required and I think when we

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,970
get to that point we may be fail to see

00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:00,790
better options and become close to new

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:03,340
ways of thinking so um before we get on

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,690
to those new ways I think because it's a

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,510
eulogy it's fitting to have a look at

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,920
the life and evolution of clearfix it's

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,730
been good to us and it seems like the

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,010
honorable thing to do this is of course

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,470
a primitive ancestor to our modern

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,060
clearfix all those of you that know

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,790
anything about animals might say it is a

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:26,890
chimp and okay very clever Melbourne

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,120
however is a very symbolic chimp and the

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,500
reason he so happy as he's just

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,960
discovered that he can force a container

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,310
to clear as floated children by adding

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,700
an empty element at the bottom of a

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,000
container with properties clear both it

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,160
was a simple and fairly elegant solution

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,190
but it wasn't semantic and real

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,650
developers don't use empty elements what

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,270
this chimp didn't realize was that like

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,640
a fish taking the first evolutionary

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,390
steps out of water the next few years

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,740
were about to be a little bit awkward

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,420
and I'll hope I hope that you'll forgive

00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,920
me for extending that metaphor but it

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,740
was totally worth it just to get that on

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:07,960
a slide there is a point my point is

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,050
that our early clearfix tricks were not

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,970
exactly pretty you might remember

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,920
examples like that I don't expect you to

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,460
read it all just just glance at it with

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,920
a fond nostalgia it contains various

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,210
hacks to target specific browsers but in

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,220
each case those hacks are trying to

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,750
achieve the same thing that is to

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,160
trigger an internal browser rendering

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,970
property known as block formatting

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,920
context or has layout nie if you don't

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,600
know what blog formatting context is

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,580
simply put it's the devil's magic

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,770
it's a rendering context that can only

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,630
be triggered indirectly by CSS and it's

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,940
what all of our early clearfix hacks

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,140
were about one of its side effects

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:50,150
happens to be clear fix but pretty soon

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,370
browsers lifted their game and we didn't

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,990
need all these different tricks I call

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,330
this one a transitional stage clearfix

00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:02,090
it still has some of the hacks but it's

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:03,500
not as scary and sometime in 2011

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,530
Nicholas Gallagher improved on it again

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,060
and gave us the micro clearfix if you're

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,120
using a clearfix today it should look

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,950
something like this and the interesting

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,830
point to make about this one is it

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,540
pretty much brings us full circle like

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,340
the earliest example we're back to

00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,050
adding an empty element at the bottom of

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,210
a container with the property clear both

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,240
and the only difference is at this time

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,490
it's a pseudo element that's why I think

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
it can be useful to take a look at the

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,760
life and evolution of patterns because

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:40,810
sometimes I think it can point us to the

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:43,460
future so just a quick show of hands

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,060
who's used to clear fixed in the last 12

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,380
months okay and if those of you that put

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,050
your hand up and that was nearly

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:55,670
everyone who's used in the context of a

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:58,820
dot clear fixed type utility class a lot

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:02,240
of you I suspect that at some point all

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,820
of you have and it's something I'm

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,860
guilty of as well I'll be willing to bet

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,080
you my left hand and this is my left

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,720
hand if anyone wants to know what

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,220
they're getting into that will be saying

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,470
goodbye to this technique once and for

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,810
all this year and there's two reasons

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,210
that I think that firstly there's a lot

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,220
of options that we can use now that

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,440
don't require us to have a clear fix at

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,020
all but more importantly in terms of a

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,850
dot clear fixed type utility class I

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,390
think that pre processes like less and

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,380
sass have made a huge difference here

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,060
previously might have been easier to

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,250
write a utility class and that the class

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,600
name where needed in the HTML this was

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,580
obviously quicker than writing the same

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,890
clear fix on multiple components in our

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,570
style sheets but of course we've mix-ins

00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,780
we can write at once and use it where

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,780
needed

00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,719
again this is something I had some

00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:53,520
difficulty letting go of I don't know if

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:54,869
you can read that up the back but it

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,869
kept me up at night for quite a while

00:07:54,869 --> 00:08:04,619
and I'll always have fond memories of

00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:06,300
this I used to call this the clear fixed

00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:08,069
shotgun approach if you don't know how

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,580
to solve a layout problem just clear fix

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:13,229
all the things this was particularly

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,639
common in large teams with multiple

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,229
developers and it was always a nice

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,779
surprise to open a document and find

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:23,490
this it wasn't until preprocessors gave

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,249
as placeholders that we were able to

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,229
forcefully put an end to this place

00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:29,550
holders differ from regular mix-ins and

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,159
that they're not rendered to the final

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,479
style sheet except where they used so

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,459
this means that there's no need to have

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,190
a utility arm a utility class in your

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,620
style sheet at all in general I think

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,990
that modern tools like preprocessors and

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,399
auto prefixes can be great to help you

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,740
in times of grief and when you're having

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,569
difficulty letting go and I think you

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,279
should lean on them to test my theory on

00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:55,500
the decline of the clearfix utility I

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,709
wrote a little script to check for its

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,209
presence I then visited the blogs and

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:03,240
websites of all the speakers and

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,319
organizers at CSS conf because that's a

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,970
great way to make friends at a

00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:12,569
conference luckily when conducting this

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,689
little test I found that the utility

00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:17,819
class is indeed out of flavor around 50

00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:20,730
odd websites i visited i think only five

00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:22,259
had a utility class and those that did

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,600
tended to be the larger blogs and

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,990
websites that maybe have legacy code or

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,939
um rely on frameworks and to be fair

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,649
this did include one large government

00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:36,829
website so i hope I've convinced you

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:40,259
that maybe we don't need a utility class

00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:45,509
but do we need a clearfix at all and the

00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:46,709
answers mmm depends maybe not now but in

00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,689
a lot of situations there are better

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,779
alternatives and I think it's time we

00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:52,860
took a look at some examples so firstly

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,750
if all you're doing is laying out

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,510
content in columns then you might

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,280
consider funnily enough CSS columns

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,930
and you might say that support for

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,640
columns is still a little bit sketchy

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,200
but in my mind it's just an enhancement

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,800
and you can have it in everything from

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,390
ie10 on so if you need to support

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,490
columns in older browsers there's

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,980
techniques like display table or inline

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,100
block approaches my view is if you don't

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,190
need a grid you probably don't need

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,180
columns in ie9 either so I think we can

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,030
take a look at a slightly more

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,010
complicated example this is of course

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,590
the media object the media object was

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,130
popularized by Nicole Sullivan and it's

00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,630
the poster child of object-oriented CSS

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,620
it's been a pretty solid go to the

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,050
pattern for a number of years

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,880
traditionally it involves a image inside

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,470
a container with the image floated to

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,670
one side and they're heading in some

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,260
text to the other apart from the

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,730
container requiring a clearfix the

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,030
content also needs a block format in

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,740
context or a left margin equal to the

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,780
width of the image to prevent the text

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,150
from wrapping underneath so without

00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,300
hacks and magic numbers you can run into

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:10,170
some problems like this and I see these

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,360
a lot when exploring the web so how can

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:16,550
we rethink this one's for robust example

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:21,450
to get rid of its reliance on clearfix I

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:23,940
found a solution by this guy I don't

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,600
really know who he is but his solution

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,210
looks pretty good harry wrote about

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,860
something calls the flag object and it's

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,800
more than a poorly disguised rebranding

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,080
of the media object it improves upon it

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,770
with additional versatility and added

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,930
options so we can vertically Center the

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,840
image or we can align it to the bottom

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,540
in the top two examples as well as this

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,160
because the image isn't floated its

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,080
container can extend to the full height

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,520
of the component this means that we can

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,530
have different background colors for

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,000
different sections and that's something

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,710
we can't do with a traditional media

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,350
object it relies on display table and

00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,390
table cell and personally I feel like

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,000
display tables something that's often

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,650
criminally overlooked I wouldn't use it

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,160
for laying out an entire site but I

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,860
think used

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,560
moderation and components like this it

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:22,019
can be very useful in this example is

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,029
supported as far back as ie8 but if

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,800
you're ready there's also perhaps an

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,069
even more versatile implementation that

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,160
uses flexbox by filler Walton this is

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:34,350
from his site sold by flexbox like the

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
flag object its implementation allows us

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,490
to position the image however we like

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,959
but in addition to that we get sauce or

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,639
to control which means that we can put

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,139
the image on the left or the right hand

00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,750
side of the component without changing

00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:49,339
anything about the HTML which is very

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,600
handy as well as that we get other

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,970
fine-grained control over the layout of

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,970
all the the different parts and that's

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,589
something that's inherent in flexbox I

00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,819
don't want to go into all the different

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,769
alignment options and possibilities

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:04,139
available with flexbox because that

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,699
could be an entire talk but suffice to

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,379
say that flexbox gives us greater

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:11,069
control over layout than any of the

00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,180
techniques that we currently use as well

00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:14,399
as that because these techniques are

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,199
built in to flexbox they're incredibly

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,100
robust which means we're not relying on

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:23,250
hacks and yeah much more comfortable

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,529
using them so you can find examples of

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,540
that in other patterns on for Walton

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,000
site soil I flexbox and if you haven't

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,259
seen it I definitely recommend having a

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,420
look at it after CSS conf so I just like

00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:40,589
to take a moment to reflect on clear fix

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,079
we've loved you and you were there for

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,509
us when things were tough you'll always

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,089
have a place in our heart but sadly we

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,430
no longer need you like we once did you

00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,589
may be destined to fade into obscurity

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:57,240
but you will not be forgotten Thank You

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:59,610
clearfix but of course we can't dwell on

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,750
our sorrow for clearfix too long because

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,459
there's other patterns we want to say

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,970
goodbye to and one of those that I'd

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,620
like to touch on is negative margins

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,019
despite their images are hack negative

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,660
margins are often used exactly as we

00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:16,079
intended there well described by the CSS

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,430
specification and I'm not firing at

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,079
negative margins in general but I do

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,149
think that now the use of negative

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,459
margins tends to be a symptom of poor

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,720
choices now CSS

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:27,040
with new layout options available i'm

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,820
finding fewer situations where i

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,380
actually need negative margins one

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
practical example of negative margins

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,920
that I do want to focus on is a pattern

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,380
that I've used hundreds of times it's

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,580
one that's again felt really robust and

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,640
comfortable for a long time and it's

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:45,940
probably familiar to a lot of you I'm

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,890
talking about modal's or more generally

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,740
positioning any element in the center of

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,959
the screen it might be a log on box or a

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,300
message or some kind of user interaction

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,950
or you might be asking me to share your

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,640
article on Facebook before I've even

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,779
read it or determined if it's relevant

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,320
of course if that's what you're doing

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:07,350
you can just stop but there are

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,060
legitimate uses for a pattern like this

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,370
and although it might not be as close to

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,029
our hearts as clearfix was let's take a

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,950
quick look at the life of this pattern

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:21,010
so historically we might have used an

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,980
alert or a confirmed dialogue but these

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,209
of course were ugly and obnoxious and we

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,250
couldn't change a thing about how they

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,959
looked so understandably we all just

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:41,399
avoided them in favor of custom options

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:41,399
oh do I want to go to the next slide yes

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:51,720
okay yes I did alright sorry about that

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,520
what was what was I talking about ok so

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,620
these custom solutions usually involve

00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,990
negative margins so the trick was to

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,360
give the element in absolute position

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,700
and a top and left value of fifty

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,470
percent this will place the top left

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,750
corner of the element in the center of

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,370
the screen to put the center of the

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,560
element in the center of the screen we

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,870
also gave it a negative margin equal to

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,250
half its height sorry a negative top

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,380
margin equal to half its height and a

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,770
negative left margin equal to half its

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,370
width you probably familiar this

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:26,529
technique as anyone's still using this a

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,470
couple occasionally I sometimes find

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,510
myself going to it just out of habit but

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,190
there are better ways the problem with

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,079
that technique is that the width the

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,019
height and the margins are all magic

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,509
numbers

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,790
I also find that with responsive designs

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:44,029
I'm writing multiple specific variations

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,399
of this as well as an inline version to

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,929
support mobile devices and there might

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,459
also be situations where I don't know

00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:51,739
the width and height of the element that

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,049
I'm trying to position or where they

00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:55,579
should be percentages so that one's

00:16:54,049 --> 00:17:01,129
fairly robust techniques no longer

00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:02,420
meeting a lot of my needs to try and

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,339
address this on certainly my first

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,610
inclination was to try and make those

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,079
negative margins percentages and that's

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,559
a mistake I only made about a hundred

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,620
and twenty times before realizing of

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,240
course that negative margins percentages

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,069
and negative margins are relative to the

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,689
parent container not to the element that

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:27,350
you're trying to position but luckily

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:29,240
that is how CSS transforms work unlike

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,279
negative margins when using translate to

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,750
position an element at Israel and the

00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,880
relative to the element the user on a

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,470
position so you can say move this fifty

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,610
percent of its own width or fifty

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,250
percent of its own height in any

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:44,559
direction this of course means no magic

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:46,460
numbers and what's more it's intuitive a

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,870
lot of you have probably seen that

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,380
technique and you might even be using it

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:53,840
now but this too is a transitional stage

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,889
solution I think its patterns on the

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,710
verge of making another evolutionary

00:17:54,889 --> 00:18:00,470
step and I'm talking about the dialogue

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,880
element it's relatively new and it only

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,440
works in the latest versions of Chrome

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,029
and opera but there are some good

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,649
polyfills and you can start making use

00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:10,789
of it now so the dialogue element as you

00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,590
can see I don't know if you can read it

00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,270
it doesn't require any CSS for

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:19,429
positioning at all it gets automatic

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:21,080
centering in addition to that we get it

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:23,090
scales you know because I've set the

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,090
width to seventy percent but in addition

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:29,570
to that we get this some backdrop pseudo

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:32,299
element now and that's really quite

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:34,510
nifty to quickly set pink back

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,290
background overlays

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:40,190
because that's something that was always

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,900
relatively difficult with CSS as well as

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:45,620
that we get showing hide methods for

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:49,220
free so it's a lot better than a lot of

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,040
our custom solutions and again I think

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,800
in a circle of life kind of way this

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,380
pattern has come back to its origins

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,990
we've got full control over the CSS and

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,670
presentation now but like the early

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,550
examples again we're back to a semantic

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,110
representation of a dialogue with native

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,929
JavaScript methods for interacting with

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,000
it and this is often how it goes we

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,770
start with a problem and a solution that

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,820
doesn't quite meet our needs and we bend

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:20,030
it and then we break it we try hacks

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,580
with it sometimes new hacks and new

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:27,080
solutions evolve and sometimes a new

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,700
element like the dialogue is born the

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,070
final example of negative margins that I

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,020
want to touch on is this does anyone

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,880
know what that is just by looking at

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:41,030
that you probably all said the Holy

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,500
Grail layout I want to touch on this

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,500
very quickly because it's not used very

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,300
much today but in the desktop error it

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,460
was the base pattern possibly for the

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:54,830
majority of websites it's still kind of

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,679
common thanks to advertising but it uses

00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:00,950
a fluid central column and fixed outer

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:07,670
columns and historically to achieve this

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:10,250
pattern we'd place the the center column

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,710
first in the HTML inside a container and

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:19,640
then we push the left and right columns

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:21,740
into place using negative margins we

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,910
didn't do this because it was ideal and

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,470
then that the column sat outside the

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,170
main container and tab order would be

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,700
confusing and for this and other reasons

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,800
we've largely stopped using these

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,120
patterns but again just as we're

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,750
starting to say goodbye to this

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,800
technique we've got new

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,550
techniques that help us meet those

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,380
challenges we were trying to hack around

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:46,680
and again Philip Walton covers that

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,930
example really well on his site so it's

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,490
goodbye negative margins our

00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,740
relationship was one of necessity but

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,300
you made so many things possible and

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,070
whilst it might be goodbye it could be a

00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,570
chance to reacquaint us reacquaint

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:02,580
ourselves with patterns whom thanks to

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:05,010
your hockey ways we lost our spark and

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,360
that brings me to the final farewell I'd

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,100
like to talk about the shake up that

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,480
viewport units who are about to give

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,000
some of our topography and lay out best

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,280
practices viewport units have been

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,820
around since 2012 and they're fairly

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,350
well supported in fact I think I II was

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:25,320
an early mover and these are supported

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:27,780
as far back as I e 9 they're relatively

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,460
easy to understand one viewport unit is

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,250
simply one percent of the viewport and

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,400
there are four types of viewport units

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,890
VW which is the viewport width vh which

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,020
is the viewport height and v men which

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,090
is the width or height whichever is

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,660
small and obviously v-max is the width

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,280
or height whichever is larger so the

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,110
reason that viewport units aren't used

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,580
more I don't think is due to a lack of

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,280
browser support or developer

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,290
understanding my guess is is probably

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,720
more likely to the due to the lack of

00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:02,010
precise control that designers have over

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:04,520
probably font sizes and this might sound

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,240
like a familiar dilemma to some of you

00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,920
you might have thought that we say

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,770
goodbye to pixel based font sizes in the

00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,460
late 2000s and for the most part we did

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,570
we favored am's and percentages because

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,330
pixel-based fonts didn't resize

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,700
according to user preferences and this

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:28,140
was bad for accessibility if not just

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:31,400
rude but pixel-based topography wasn't

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,480
dead it was just lurking in the shadows

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,100
gathering its strength and waiting for

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,400
the days when browsers offered zoom to

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,310
enlarge text and with that development

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,510
some developers thought that the

00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,510
accessibility of pixel based fonts was

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,890
no longer as much of a concern that

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,440
debate still rages but the truth is

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,020
whether we're using

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,420
MSR EMS or percentages they're all just

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,390
abstractions of a base font size which

00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:00,410
is usually 16 pixels so we never gave up

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,510
complete control but viewport units are

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,490
different again they represent an

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,490
evolutionarily a fundamental change in

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,770
approach the viewpoint units are not

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,140
relative to the base sorry to the base

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,400
font size in any way their relative to

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,100
the viewport with which the user

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,640
controls and that might be what's scary

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,770
for some so what's good about them is it

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,890
means goodbye too clunky responsive type

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,780
techniques like this as you can see it's

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,830
very jumpy I might have exaggerated it

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:36,050
just a tad it also involves multiple

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:38,690
media queries so in addition to that the

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,000
the text it doesn't scale in proportion

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,160
to anything else on the site so it can

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,100
overflow containers and trigger scroll

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,460
bars and it's just a mess and if I

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,110
feeding on gremlin after midnight so if

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,380
we have a look at that same example with

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:57,590
viewport units you can see that the text

00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,860
scale smoothly we don't need half a

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,110
dozen media queries but when the

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,660
viewport width gets very small it

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:12,080
becomes problematic so luckily there are

00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:14,270
a few methods for avoiding this we can

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,330
use a media query to only apply viewport

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,610
units above a certain screen resolution

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:22,880
and this means that beyond that it will

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:26,090
just be whatever default we set we can

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,430
also use cow to say the absolute minimum

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,280
font size is 16 pixels so that examples

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,800
16 pixels plus 3 viewport wits at a

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:39,190
viewport width of 0 it will be exactly

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,190
16 pixels and from there it will scale

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,960
ok I should also mention that some

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,440
browsers still have some difficulty

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,030
using viewport units and calc together

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,650
so for now the media query option might

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:56,630
be safer in the days before CSS conf

00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,580
when I should have been preparing this I

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,059
was thinking more about the limitations

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:05,889
of viewport units because any new

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:08,919
it has new limitations and whilst we can

00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:12,340
limit scaling with calc we don't have a

00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,129
complete control yet so I could say for

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,769
example I wanted to set a font size of

00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:20,669
12 pixels at a viewport resolution of

00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:23,080
600 pixels and for that I could choose

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,639
to view port wits which of course I just

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,720
happen to know and don't have written

00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:31,480
down at all from there it will scale as

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,490
the viewport unit scale but once we've

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,350
made that choice if we wanted the font

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,690
size at 800 pixels to be something

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,059
specific we'd have to have another jump

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,730
with it with a media query to change the

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:45,519
view port for the font size with you a

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,649
different viewport width sorry to use a

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,450
different view port unit so in other

00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:51,759
words we don't have complete control

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:57,360
over the rate at which viewport unit

00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:59,740
scale actually it turns out that we can

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,610
I'm not going to go into this code here

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:06,340
but I wrote a blog post detailing how we

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:10,059
can get viewport units to scale between

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,749
a specific for between a specific pixel

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:15,639
range within a specific view port range

00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:19,119
the way it works basis basically is it

00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:22,090
takes a scale and then transposes it so

00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,119
if you had the number say one and a

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,529
hundred and the value of 50 and then you

00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,809
wanted to move that onto a scale between

00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:31,149
one and two hundred the new value would

00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:33,249
be a hundred so both of those values are

00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:34,809
right in the middle of those ranges so

00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:38,080
that does this for a viewport width and

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,149
then applies that to a pixel size that

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,490
you want like I said I wrote a blog post

00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:44,919
about this so i won't go more into the

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,110
detail there i don't know how useful

00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,639
this technique might be but the purpose

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,649
that on trying to illustrate is that

00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:53,830
there's new hacks for us to keep pushing

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,720
limitations of CSS and for me this is

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,960
the most exciting part of what i like to

00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,820
do and that's how each of the the

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,879
earlier hacks that i mentioned came

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,399
about so i encourage you all to get

00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:08,860
hacking and try to discover and push

00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,179
those limitations ninety-nine percent of

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,700
the time you probably won't discover

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,020
something as useful as a clearfix but i

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,370
think a hundred percent of the time

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,840
you will discover a greater

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,060
understanding of the technology you're

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:24,910
working with and that's almost as

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:26,530
exciting okay so like any eulogy you've

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:32,470
ever been to this one ends with a

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:34,510
closing rant now that we've had a

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,920
detailed look at the light and evolution

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,450
of a few common patterns as well as some

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,850
of the hacks and techniques that we've

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,430
used you might have noticed a familiar

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,470
theme our hacks are usually just clever

00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,990
workarounds for the limitations of CSS

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:50,050
and usually those limitations that we're

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,670
trying to push relate to lay out in fact

00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,500
in many ways this has been a talk about

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:58,870
layout that's what I tricked all of you

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,690
that is because CSS was not designed for

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:03,310
solving layout problems it was designed

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,560
for adding simple styles to HTML

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,960
elements and now for the first time in

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,580
20 years or on the verge of an era where

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,170
we have features in CSS designed

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,870
specifically to help us with layout

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,420
problems and yet we're still having

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,160
difficulty letting go I'm constantly

00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,980
hearing that flexbox is hard or

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,280
confusing could we be a bigger bunch of

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,630
hypocritical whingers really for years

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,890
we complained about not having this

00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,470
stuff and now that we have it were

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:34,240
apathetic at best I think without a

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:40,780
doubt using viewport units transforms

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,280
and sorry in flexbox is far less

00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,620
confusing than the methods that we've

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,090
cobbled together using negative margins

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:52,270
and absolute positioning and clearfix

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:53,500
hacks so I hope I've helped you all to

00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,110
grieve and get some well needed closure

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,510
but I also helped hope that I've helped

00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,030
you to move on as I said we're about to

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,740
start a new era of CSS and it's not

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,220
going to be easy it's going to be

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,350
difficult there's going to be new new

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,000
quirks new limitations but also new

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,950
hacks for us to keep pushing these

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,720
boundaries and that's what I want to

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,480
encourage each of you to do we've got

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,780
decompress tomorrow and I want to see

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,350
each what each of you can come up with

00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,350
