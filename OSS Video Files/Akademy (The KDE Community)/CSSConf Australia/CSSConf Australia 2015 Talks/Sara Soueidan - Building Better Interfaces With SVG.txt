my name is Sarah as Fiamma said and I

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:12,690
love SVG this pretty much says a lot so

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,250
okay so how do I start this I want to I

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,590
want to start this with a disclaimer

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,080
first I also love CSS I've even written

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,390
a CSS reference for code drops if you're

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,180
familiar with it so but there's going to

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,730
be a lot of CSS verses at the SVG stuff

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,519
in my talk so I wanted to give this

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,320
disclaimer first just so you don't think

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,480
that I hate SVG okay or have anything

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,270
against it but throughout this talk I

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,920
want to show you how you can use SVG or

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,870
how SVG provides us with better

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,790
alternatives two common approaches that

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,280
we usually take when creating or doing

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,500
stuff using CSS or HTML 5 canvas for

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,860
example so there's going to be a lot of

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,629
use SVG slides okay now so if by the end

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,280
of the talk you feel like you want to go

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,660
out and start using SVG more then I will

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,050
have accomplished everything that I that

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm here for today now there are many

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,650
reasons why you should be using SVG the

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,159
number one reason is SVG is awesome

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,990
really I mean this pretty much sums it

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,580
up but I think that everyone here is

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,930
familiar with its how its scalable

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,720
resolution-independent there are

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,090
infinite not infinite but the number of

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,210
tools for creating animating spriting

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,830
SPG's has become is is is becoming much

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,509
more every especially during the past

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,790
year with all the attention that SVG has

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,189
been getting browser support is really

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,560
good if you care about IE 8 and below

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,119
which do not support SVG you have a lot

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,880
of fallback techniques that you can use

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,460
so there's really no excuse why you

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,009
wouldn't be using SVG SVG today so

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,659
before I move on how many of you do use

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,729
SVG and production and real life

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,439
projects today oh that's a lot awesome

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:50,729
ok I was kind of hoping that I'm going

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,900
to have I would have to convince you

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,330
more so

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,700
since you already do use SVG I'm hoping

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,860
that okay maybe then you will find some

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,070
new use cases or example where you would

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,360
want to use it more so Anna I know from

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,310
my conversations over Twitter I know

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,259
that a lot of people avoid or avoid

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,910
using SVG or refrain from using it for

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,540
icon systems for example or for any

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,250
other use cases because well because of

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,110
the nature of SVG because it's an image

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,820
format and it's also a document it has

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,800
the advantages and limitations of an

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,220
image format and advantages and

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,260
limitations of a document so it can get

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,820
sometimes really messy but it's not

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,739
really messy it's just that you can have

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,660
so many options so many things that you

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,250
can choose from that can become

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,660
overwhelming and a lot of developers are

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,760
like what the heck I don't want to even

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,650
think about it so I know that a lot of

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,989
developers still use icon fonts by the

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,730
way I hate icon fonts they still use

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,890
icon fonts just because it's easier

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,000
someone told me that on Twitter they

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,680
don't want to have to worry about

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,050
providing fall back for ie8

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,820
that's the only reason well I'm going to

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:58,459
talk about icon fonts more later in the

00:02:52,820 --> 00:03:00,530
talk but you know the number two reason

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,930
why you should be using SVG today is to

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,250
push SVG forward like right now I'm

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,959
trying to convince you to use about you

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,560
already do

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,030
okay so pushing SVG forward a lot like I

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,680
said a lot of developers different

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,480
refrain from using it because there are

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,519
a lot of features that are missing right

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,850
now but you see SVG is getting much

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,840
better

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,680
SVG level 2 already has a lot of

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,390
improvements and additional features

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,310
that are not available at SVG 1 like

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,959
z-index which is something we really

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,940
missed considering that everything in an

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,650
SVG is positioned absolutely we really

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,239
need that index so we're going to get

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,280
that SVG 2 we're going to get more

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,530
attributes that we can animate and

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,320
change using CSS so it's getting better

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,110
but if there is anything any limitation

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,239
any reason why you're not using SVG

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,400
maybe you should just use it and spec

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,890
editors usually listen they always

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,140
listen if you have a feature request it

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,970
can easily if you provide them with a

00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,680
practical use cases can easily turn into

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,150
a specification the specification is

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,590
going to be implemented at some point

00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,610
you're going to feel very happy and

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,160
you're going to make others in the

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,930
community really happy an example of

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,540
this actually a while back I was working

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,810
on

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,150
on some client work my client requested

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,780
that the SVG would change on different

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,459
screen sizes okay so the first thing

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,350
that came to my mind was to use the view

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,780
box attribute because the view box

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,239
allows you to specify which parts of the

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,009
SVG you want to show okay so my first

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,530
idea was to use the view box in order to

00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,240
just change the value of the view box to

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,500
range the size whatever on different

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,650
screen sizes and you've got our

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,990
direction and SVG but since we cannot do

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,360
that and CSS I had to use JavaScript and

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,770
then it got a little messy because my

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,660
client requested other things so I ended

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,180
up giving it up I asked a spec editor

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,180
whether or not it would be possible to

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,210
have a view box property in CSS so he

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,300
told me that send the proposal to the

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,710
SVG working group send them your working

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,940
and not working it's not gonna be

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,099
working because it's not implemented but

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,750
send them a use case a practical use

00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,340
case and it might turn into a

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,830
specification and you're going to end up

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,389
with whatever you want now there are

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,460
some limitations in SVG I'm not going to

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,650
get into them because those those are

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,050
not the subject of the talk but if you

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,030
have any requests talk to the spec

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,030
editors pester them but not really too

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:19,320
much okay and don't tell them I said

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,320
that CSS or SVG so I want to start with

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,120
a comparison between CSS and SVG methods

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,159
we use CSS a lot of times to create

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,620
certain things but SVG provides us with

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,270
a much better alternative it's much

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,030
better much much more semantic

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,860
accessible as you're going to see so a

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:41,010
while back I saw a tweet by Fantas I how

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,289
do you pronounce it like that okay

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,240
fanta sorry so he created something he

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,370
had overheard someone say people end up

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,710
making graphics with CSS instead of SVG

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,960
because for many use cases it offers

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,449
them more flexibility which is absurd

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,729
now I'm still confused about the street

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,770
I don't know if whoever said that did

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,690
they mean that's yes as did they mean

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,310
that is absurd that's just as provides

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,360
more flexibility because they think that

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,650
SVG is more flexible or is it that CSS

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
does indeed provide them more

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,099
flexibility which is observed because as

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,080
we should be providing them with more

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:16,289
I'm not making any sense but then again

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,300
I still am still confused by it but no

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,669
matter what they meant

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,560
whichever case it is fact remains that

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,300
there are some situations where CSS does

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,099
indeed provide us with more flexibility

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,620
than SVG and where you should be and

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:29,270
where I personally recommend using CSS

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,120
the number one example that I can think

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:36,979
about is CSS animations versus SVG

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,080
animations or aka smell smell can become

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,610
a real pain in the neck if you're going

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,460
to animate the SVG animated

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,470
transformations inside an SVG it can

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,090
become really messy if you want to

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,530
really know how messy it gets try it

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,960
yourself but you're going to hate me so

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,819
maybe you don't want to do it if you

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,389
wanna if CSS animations are more

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,620
flexible if you have multiple

00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,539
transformation animations that are

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,470
applying it's going to be much simpler

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,970
and easier using CSS but okay general

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,069
speed this is a side note if you're

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,180
going to animate SPG's transformations

00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,340
whatever I recommend you I usually

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,860
recommend using JavaScript because CSS

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,020
animations transformations on SVG are

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,210
still very much buggy and many browsers

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,919
and are supported and ie smell is not

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,590
supported in IE at all and might be

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,270
pulled out of link so if you have some

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,169
serious animation work I recommend using

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,639
a JavaScript library okay so the first

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,860
example I'm going to go over that we

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,919
usually use CSS for or some of us you

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,460
CSS to do and we shouldn't be using it

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,130
is creating CSS only images like one CSS

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,979
only Monalisa versus only whatever I

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,389
know it is for fun a lot of people do it

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,880
for fun but I also know that some people

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,110
do it for actual production work and the

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,270
only thing that I can think about when

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,270
someone says this is only images is this

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,330
this says it all I'm not going to

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,979
comment more so SVG is an image format

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,330
if you're going to create an image use

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,190
SVG if it's all about challenging

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,770
yourself and improving your CSS skills

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,729
or your coding skills in general then

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,590
maybe try creating SVG paths and tax

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:14,090
manually instead of using a graphics

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,590
editor now that would be an amazing

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,889
challenge if it's all just about

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,159
challenging yourself now and then

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,020
there's this thing called CSS shapes

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,940
which are basically just shapes also

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,680
creating music created using CSS some

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,210
people do it for fun which is perfectly

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,100
fine and some people do it for actual

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,930
production

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,910
but why would you want to do that I mean

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,560
the heart shape on the left it is true

00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,620
that the code in here is bloated because

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,660
it's old and has a lot of WebKit

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,100
prefixes that are no longer needed but

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,790
if you look at the heart shape on the

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,300
left using CSS and the first SVG on top

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,890
I mean SVG is an image it's an actual

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,780
shape you're drawing a shape using an

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,630
SVG path it's more semantic it's more

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,640
accessible this is how it should be done

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,020
okay an SVG comes with a lot of other

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,580
elements for creating all kinds of

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,280
different shapes you have paths for

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,580
creating arbitrarily shaped shapes and

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,790
you have circles polygons rectangles and

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,530
much much more and what counts what what

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,650
the most important part here is that the

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,570
CSS shapes are are not real content

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,640
they're fake content they usually a div

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,250
or whatever a non semantic element just

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,770
thrown in the markup and you just style

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,990
it into some certain shape but SVG

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:30,520
shapes are real content so if you need

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:34,540
something like this do this use SVG this

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,990
is the first one now since SVG is better

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,520
equipped for creating arbitrarily shaped

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,290
elements in general it is it only makes

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,090
sense that is it is better equipped for

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,250
creating arbitrarily shaped UI

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,950
components and the first example that I

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,330
can think about is creating radial menus

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,030
radial menus are more popular than I

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,770
ever thought because a little over a

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,720
year I wrote an article for code drops

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,630
where I explained how to create a radial

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,620
menus using CSS only it is very hacky

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,270
now this technique was was generally

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,740
thought of by Anna Tudor and I just

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,630
wrote the article explaining how you can

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,480
do it so this is basically how you do it

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:13,150
you have a set of elements inside your

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
navigation use cue the elements and then

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,930
you rotate them and then you unsecure

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,060
the content inside of them you're still

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,830
not getting that sector shape and so in

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,710
order to fake that check to sector shape

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,880
you you make the count you know just

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,890
like you see here the container is made

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,920
into a circle and the overflow is cut

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,600
and you end up with something that looks

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,270
like a radial menu but it's not really a

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,070
radial menu okay however if you're going

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,900
to do it with SVG it's going to be much

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,060
more different and much more semantic in

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,370
order to create a sector and SVG we need

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,390
three points line from the first to the

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,370
other

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,040
ARC to the third and you just closed the

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,080
sector and you're done this all you need

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,970
the sector is an actual sector it's an

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,470
element and if you need many more

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,790
elements you just add as many as you

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,390
need and then you rotate them and that's

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,370
all you need

00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,830
pointer events work here as expected

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,510
with CSS it's so buggy when I created

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,120
the examples for the co troops article

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,770
all of the examples worked even in ie9

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,450
and above but when I tried them a while

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,460
back when I was preparing for this talk

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,880
it didn't work in Chrome and I have no

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,010
idea why so it's really buggy if you're

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,230
going to create some UI components that

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,200
are not rectangular don't try to bend

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,650
the box model and try to make it do what

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,380
it's not meant to do and use SVG instead

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,600
definitely use SVG now creating now

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,210
there's one thing creating the sector

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,100
and SVG is really simple because you

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,200
know drawing a line as simple even if

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,820
you're going to do it manually I

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,320
literally did it manually here the arc

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,380
can be drawn also very simple all you

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,370
need is the the angle and the radius of

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:49,390
the circle and you're set but we can get

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,400
a little tedious is when you have to add

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,260
the icons to the right to the circle and

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,030
position the icons so in order to make

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,500
it's easier for me because I'm kind of

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,270
lazy when it comes to these things and

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,520
to others are key I created this tool

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,620
which is called circular stat SVG which

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,720
allows you to create radial menus you

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,420
have a lot of options even two Styles

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,730
you can you can choose from you can add

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,650
gaps now add gaps it's going to generate

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,120
the SVG code for you even everything's

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:18,180
going to be ready for the icons you want

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,380
to add just ug it's a GUI basically okay

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,760
styling form elements another example

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,760
where SVG provides us with something

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,360
that CSS cannot let's go let's start

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,030
with checkboxes in order to style a

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,750
checkbox in SVG we have n CSS we have

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,340
actually two ways the first one is using

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,870
you don't have to use any image sprites

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,000
in the first one basically you have the

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,410
label without any text and then you

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,390
style the background using radial

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,060
gradients etc but I usually prefer

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,220
having text in the label so this is the

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,110
second technique where you just hide the

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,980
checkbox everyone's familiar with how to

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,030
style the checkbox right oh no ok that's

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,050
good at least I have something to

00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,089
explain

00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,769
so you have a checkbox the actual

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:01,480
checkbox that is being rendered you set

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,489
it to set the display to none you want

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,610
to hide it and then you apply a

00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:08,800
background image to the label okay so

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,540
the background image is usually a sprite

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,089
like the one shown above here it

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,519
contains the checked and unchecked

00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:17,949
styles of the checkbox that you want

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,389
that you want to style and then you can

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,980
either use JavaScript to handle the

00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:23,850
click events or the check pseudo class

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,319
and CSS basically you have the first

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,329
none checked style applied as a

00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,949
background image and then just like you

00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,259
would do with any other sprite when the

00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,610
checkbox is checked just change the

00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:36,720
position of the background image and

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:40,839
you're going to get the styled style

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,209
okay however you know this works it does

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,799
work but you're not going to get any

00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:46,720
animation you're just going to get an

00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,639
image that changes when the when the

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,029
checkbox is checked but if you want to

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,249
achieve something like this this is much

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,899
better right you're getting the the user

00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:58,869
is getting a much better feedback it's

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,279
it feels more natural so to do this

00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:02,860
you're not gonna be able to do it in SN

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,350
CSS but you can do it in SVG and it has

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,660
a few advantages so in order to do it in

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,819
SVG you first of all you're not going to

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,040
need any image sprite so this saves an

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,059
extra HTTP request and generally

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,009
speaking when you're going to style

00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:17,110
checkboxes or elements so small the SVG

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,670
is used is going to be really small so

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,220
in lining it and putting it inside the

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,350
HTML it's not going to be any problem so

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,350
you would just add the SVG inside the

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,990
label as shown in the example above

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,939
first there's this line drawing

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,170
technique again how many of your firm

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:36,759
are familiar with the line drawing

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,799
technique okay so the line drawing

00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,779
technique how does it work when I was

00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,119
reversing the talk I I thought about

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,799
explaining it by using spaghetti but I

00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:48,730
don't have any access to spaghetti so

00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,049
you have you have a path whatever it is

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,649
shape that you can't see in front of you

00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:55,480
just scribble or whatever and what you

00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:59,470
do is there's a property in SVG that's

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,189
called Streck a stroke - offset that

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:07,569
allows you to it's kind of like pulling

00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:09,670
the path out of out of its position okay

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:11,200
so you pull it out so that it's not

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,960
visible anymore and then when you check

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,800
the checkbox you pull it back in and it

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:21,390
looks like it's being drawn so okay

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:25,270
should I do we have internal connection

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:27,940
okay it's not necessary no problem I'm

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,280
going to go over it again shortly so

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,870
using this technique the line drawing

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,100
technique you can create so many other

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,970
effects that this is again from an

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,610
article on code drops you see the way

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,620
you draw the checkbox checkbox not only

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,390
first we save then eight extra HTTP

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,070
requests we have an actual image you get

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,830
the animation interactions which you

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:50,140
don't get with CSS and it just it's just

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:53,680
much better okay

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,480
now the larger technique I first read

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,860
about it I think the first article that

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,020
ever mentioned it was this article by

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,180
Jake Archibald if you're interested in

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,890
learning more about it I totally

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,290
recommend this article because he has an

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,940
interactive demo which shows you exactly

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,380
how it works so you get to see exactly

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,510
how it works okay in addition to styling

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,180
check boxes with SVG you can style other

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,790
form elements like these again from code

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,030
drops I really like the way you know you

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,820
see how the way the line moves in a wave

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,340
and then pushes the the label upwards

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,500
this kind of expression cannot be done

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,150
using CSS for now maybe we may be able

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,600
to do it at some point but this is

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,120
doable and SVG because these are SVG

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,950
paths this line is an SVG path and SVG

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,200
you can animate a path you basically

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,730
have a shape and you animate it from one

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,520
from the initial shape to the other

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,720
shape okay and the animation from one

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,220
shape to the other is going to give you

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,390
effects like this and much more complex

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,700
effects that allow us to create just

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,040
amazing new eyes you know yesterday Eva

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,540
talked about timing functions and a lot

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,870
of people love using I'm one of those

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,060
people I love I be using elastic timing

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,700
functions because they can sometimes

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,320
give that extra feel to the UI making it

00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,510
a little more realistic so if you add a

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,250
visual elastic effect like this is going

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:17,380
to make it even much more realistic and

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:20,180
much much more I'm using better okay I

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,200
like the English word for this circuit

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,930
okay graphical text effects this is one

00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,800
of my favorite things that you can do

00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:35,450
with SVG a long time ago how many of you

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,030
use the this the all CSS way basically

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,820
have a heading text and you hide it

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,890
using the nine nine nine nine pixels

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,020
padding and then Scott Callum saved us

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,910
from that and by it by using the one

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,290
hundred percent and text annotation how

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,550
many of you used it okay so basically

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,560
what we're doing here is we have a

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,180
heading a text and because we want we

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,410
want it to be fancy and apply some kind

00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,360
of graphical effect to it and we

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,240
couldn't do it any other way so what we

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,910
did with was we hid the text by pushing

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,040
it far far far away at first and then

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,100
apply the background image to the text

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,420
to to them to the you know the box the

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,400
box of the text that is being rendered

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,530
and that background image would be the

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,670
same text but having a graphical effect

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,090
and we would usually get it from

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:24,350
Photoshop or something now the newer CSS

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:26,570
way to apply it Phil to text is this is

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,670
really faking a filter text we have

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,560
background clip and text fill color and

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,120
these only work and WebKit so I wouldn't

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,970
use these in production and again we're

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,650
only faking applying a filter text using

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,030
this technique these two properties what

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,490
we're doing here is we have a piece of

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,070
text this is a block text a block font

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,200
here that's why it's so thick and helps

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,480
achieve this really nice effect

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,460
depending what you're doing so we have a

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,470
text you turn it into a transparent and

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,510
then you clip the background to the

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,340
shape of that text so that it looks like

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,260
it has a fill applied to it but it

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,270
doesn't really have any fill applied the

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,660
other way that we can use in CSS now is

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,490
using as using CSS masks using CSS masks

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,410
we can use an image no matter what that

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,900
image is and then apply it as a mask to

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,970
text but that only allows us to end up

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,490
with something like not exactly like

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,110
this but you're applying texture to text

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,380
changing the texture you're not really

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,330
applying any fills to text with SVG we

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,820
have the ability to clip background to

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,050
text to but we also have much better

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:31,220
ways a much more semantic alternatives

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:32,559
this is an SVG code so okay so what are

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,820
we doing here

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,190
the important parts are the ones

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,110
highlighted in yellow so we have depths

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,240
the Deaf's element and SPG is used to

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,640
define things whatever anything that you

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,500
want to use later okay that you want to

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,580
reference later anything that you put

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,590
inside the test is not going to be

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,000
rendered on the screen so what we're

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:53,080
doing here we're defining a linear

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,179
gradient then at the bottom of the SVG

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,980
at the end we have the text element that

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,419
contains some kind of text any text that

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,669
you want and then using the fill

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,530
property which is I mean how Morse how

00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:04,570
much more semantic can it get you have a

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,070
fill and then you apply the linear

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,590
gradient that you find that you defined

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,000
before as a fill to that text and you

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,610
can end up with something like this and

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,390
it's not hacky it's 100 percent semantic

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:18,370
the text is selectable searchable it's

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,440
accessible it's perfect another example

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,150
is you can also apply text to text

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,250
because we also have mosques in SVG

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,929
again inside the depths we're defining a

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,470
mosque inside the mosque you can put

00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:31,030
anything a shape and image even more

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,429
we're going to see examples shortly and

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,470
then again using the text you apply the

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,880
mask the mask attribute you applied you

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,289
reference a mask and you apply to text

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,500
and you can end up with again something

00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:43,090
like this text is 100% semantic it's

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,309
also scalable as you scale the SVG is

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,100
going to scale by by default you don't

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:51,640
have to do anything now this is where

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,140
things can get really interesting like I

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,360
said you can put anything inside a

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,010
mosque you can put anything like if you

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,080
want to apply a fill that's not a linear

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,940
gradient that's a pattern some kind of

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,159
pattern you can even apply an animation

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,990
inside that pattern or just animate the

00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,820
pattern and CSS and you can end up with

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,740
these and the interesting part here is

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,870
that the first one at the top left the

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:18,580
burne example uses a jiff no a gif gif

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:22,490
okay so it's using a gif

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,780
and you're getting this animated effect

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,190
without having to do anything just by

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,550
referencing that image okay and you can

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,810
create all kinds of examples here now

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,720
the okay so if you're going to create

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,370
any kind of texture a texture or

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,230
graphical text effects don't you CSS

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,940
because browser support for the newer

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,920
techniques really sucks and the old

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,120
techniques just just don't use it

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,910
anymore because you don't have to you

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,590
have a better alternative the best part

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:53,800
is SVG text is fully accessible

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,800
searchable selectable and 100% semantic

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:06,250
okay creative motion effects with

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:09,220
filters we have filters and CSS right

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,450
how many of you have used filters

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,470
probably not in production maybe because

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,120
the browser support sucks okay so we

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,250
have a set of filters primitive filters

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,020
and CSS that we can use to apply to HTML

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,610
or even SVG elements these are all of

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,830
the available CSS filters blur

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,630
brightness contrast they basically apply

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,730
you know the names are self-explanatory

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,280
and you just apply them to any HTML or

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,650
SVG element this is good you can apply

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,720
multiple filters to an element get

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,290
different effects you can animate these

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,630
filters SVG provides us with the same

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,920
filters like the CSS filters are a

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,190
substitute of all of the filters that

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,170
SVG has to offer now not only do we have

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,390
more filters in SVG but the most

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,630
important and most interesting part

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:56,510
about SVG is that SVG allows us to take

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,400
the output the result of one filter and

00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,990
use it as an input to another filter and

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,210
this is what things where things can get

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,240
really interesting so an example of this

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,420
is this so again we have a depth inside

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,380
we have a filter ID goo I think you

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:15,800
might be okay do you are you familiar

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,520
with the cool effect yeah I'm going to

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,520
blow your minds

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,890
so we have a filter inside the filter

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,590
element we have three of three filter

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,330
primitives the EFI Gaussian blur

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,980
Gaussian blur color matrix and EFI

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,350
compositor so what we're doing here is

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,300
you have the result attribute and the

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,040
first filter we named it blur you can

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,410
name it anything you want and then you

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,660
use that as an input to the second

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,190
filter you know inside the N attribute

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,020
and then the result of the second use it

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,840
as an input for the third and then you

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,110
get some effect that is just genius and

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:55,830
really beautiful and mind-blowing the

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:58,350
goo effect so the Google effect can be

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,660
can be used a lot of people have been it

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,920
has been making really the rounds lately

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,510
because it's really amazing and a lot of

00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,090
people have been using it for creating

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,830
all kinds of effects and these the one

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,950
actually the chat application is my

00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,929
favorite one because you see how you

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,790
know these little dots are moving just

00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,160
like there are dots inside the water and

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:19,740
then you have the Google loader and the

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,179
menu of the menu and then you know all

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,280
these examples okay this can be done

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,020
just because you have the ability to

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,030
pass the result of one filter into

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,850
another this is not possible in CSS but

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:35,340
it is possible in SVG it takes your UI

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,290
to the next level effects like these

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,450
take your you eyes to the next level

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,110
another thing that's possible with SVG

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:46,890
filters is motion blur something like

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:49,050
this not possible in CSS and there's

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,170
this squiggly text effect it's really

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,960
funny I like it so again this one this

00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:57,059
one uses the efi turbulence filter now i

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,679
need to mention that all of these three

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,200
amazing effects have been created by the

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,880
same young man lucas beber you should

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,950
really keep an eye on his work this is

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,990
his code pen account he does all kinds

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,030
of amazing experiments especially with

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,150
SVG and this is his Twitter if you don't

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,580
check copan to much he usually tweets

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:18,540
only about his experiments so definitely

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,510
keep an eye on him so the best part

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,250
about SVG filters a lot of people I saw

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,540
a lot of comments on Lucas's article on

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,300
code robes that a lot of people said

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,320
that the filter is not working in some

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,440
browser whatever the best part is that

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,350
there

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,740
they're going to fall back perfectly

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,600
like this squiggly text effect is it

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,519
doesn't work in Firefox but you're going

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,169
to get the same text the same font the

00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,360
same everything but it's just not doing

00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:47,129
that squiggly effect so it folds back

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,389
really nicely all the folders that you

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,039
use you can use them as part of a

00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:52,169
progressive enhancement so you don't

00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,029
have any excuse not to start using them

00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:55,559
if you're using the good effect if it

00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,600
doesn't work in some browser it's just

00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,919
gonna if you have a menu that the items

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,870
are just going to spread out without

00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:05,519
that additional goo effect

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:08,429
okay so text and motion along arbitrary

00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,029
paths again something we can do in SVG

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:13,740
but we can't do and CSS yet

00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,870
first thing is text along the path and

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,940
now I don't really know how useful this

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,429
is I've never seen anyone use something

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,919
like this except maybe in logos but it

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,629
is possible in SVG and it is very simple

00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,669
all you have to do is you define a path

00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:29,009
again inside the Deaf's element and then

00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:31,409
you have a text inside the text element

00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:33,059
use the text path element where you

00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,549
reference the path that you want any

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:37,230
path it can be any path and then you put

00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,200
the text inside it and it's just going

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,120
to be laid on that path very simple very

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,730
semantic and the best part about SVG is

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,870
that it's generally speaking very human

00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,059
readable and easy to learn

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,389
you can even animate the text along a

00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:53,460
path now this does not have any use case

00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:55,590
why would I mean why would anyone use

00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,269
this unless you're inventing the marquee

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,340
and some twisted SVG way again you can

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:04,169
use the animate element in SVG and just

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:08,669
animate it along the path but don't do

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:10,500
it motion along a path and SVG you can

00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:16,139
animate elements along arbitrary paths

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:19,379
as well I have a car here was just going

00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:22,980
in circles and again you have an element

00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:26,279
it's called animate motion you reference

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,960
any element that you want to move along

00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,909
a path you give it that path that you

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,830
want to use and it starts animating

00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:33,299
there are actually two ways for

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,649
animating along paths the first one is

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,600
to use the animate motion and the second

00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:42,600
one is the same thing but instead of

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:43,590
passing the path game wizard it's

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,870
useless

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,850
okay instead of using the path attribute

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,830
you're going to use the M path which is

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,499
the most motion path element inside the

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,389
animate motion element so the idea here

00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:56,399
is just you can animate elements along

00:27:54,389 --> 00:28:01,320
the path along arbitrary paths and SVG

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:03,299
but this will be possible in CSS at some

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,830
point in September I think this

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,629
specification was created basically the

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,669
feature that we have an SVG the ability

00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:15,179
to move elements along arbitrary paths

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:16,679
and SVG has been moved to CSS we have

00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,360
seen new CSS properties

00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,009
I think implementation should have

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,929
started a few months ago but I don't

00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,369
know what was holding it back but we

00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,980
will be able to animate elements along

00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:27,509
arbitrary paths and an N CSS too and

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,820
that's going to apply to HTML and SVG

00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:32,990
elements as well and this is something

00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:39,330
to look forward to

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:41,369
icon systems this is one of the hot

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,350
topics it was one of the hot topics

00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:45,509
during the past year a lot of people

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:50,850
were pro or con fonts a lot of people

00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:52,950
were Pro SVG are con systems until Chris

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,809
Hoy wrote wrote this cage match cage

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,850
match article comparing the two systems

00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:58,409
to each other and if you're going to

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,149
read the article if you don't use SVG

00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:02,490
icons I pretty sure you're going to

00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:05,639
change your mind because SVG icons icon

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:08,220
systems are far more superior than font

00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:10,080
icons so some of the advantages of SVG

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,309
icon systems are they are infinitely

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,619
scalable and look crisp on all

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,779
resolutions icon phones don't they are

00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,269
style via CSS you can apply multiple

00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,549
colors to an icon because it's an SVG

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:22,289
image icon fonts you can't do that now I

00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,820
think I remembered I remember reading

00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:27,090
something about a technique where you

00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:30,779
layer multiple icons and you hide parts

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,639
of that icon to you know to get that

00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:34,499
multicolor effect for icon fonts but I

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,690
wouldn't do that it's too much I mean

00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:39,029
why would you want to do that you have

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,649
easier size control if you use MS to

00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,419
size your SVG it's going to scale up and

00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,730
down with the text you don't have that

00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,769
with icon fonts they're interactive and

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,899
imitable using CSS smell or JavaScript

00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:50,610
again icon fonts don't have that

00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:52,649
semantic markup our conference is all

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,030
about empty elements fully accessible

00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,160
including text if you have

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,570
texts like a letter or something and

00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,120
certain icons going to be accessible

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:01,950
you have many tools for to make creation

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,750
interaction embedding and spriting

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:08,580
easier and now this is what trips a lot

00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,410
of people off and what makes them want

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,820
to avoid using our con systems you have

00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:16,800
so many like six embedding options that

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,660
you can use to embed your SPG's and then

00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,550
you have like three or four spriting

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,620
techniques that you can use which one

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,120
would you choose it can get overwhelming

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,280
but the thing is all you have to do is

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,320
just weigh your options and weigh what

00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,880
you need and with the options that you

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,580
have and you get to choose whatever

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,700
whichever one works for you now there is

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,900
only one there is one spriting technique

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,030
which is my personal favorite but it

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:43,200
does have some limitations but again if

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,000
we push we can get rid of those

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,470
limitations and get those features that

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
we are missing now you have different

00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,320
depending techniques that each embedding

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,090
technique comes with one or more

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,240
fallback techniques that you can use to

00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:56,040
so again no excuse to not use it you see

00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,570
a while back I think it was during the

00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:03,060
last week Bruce he told me to call him

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,780
Bruce captain wonderful of opera aka

00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,780
Bruce Lawson

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,320
viselli freed man from Smashing Magazine

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,110
master magazine he was asking Bruce

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,970
about what Bruce had tweeted about all

00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,770
the new features that Opera Mini had

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,050
been getting like flexible flexible

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:22,470
support among many others so vitaly

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,240
asked Bruce whether or not Opera Mini is

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,030
going to start downloading icon fonts

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,090
and I really loved what Bruce replied

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:34,350
the way he just said we don't download

00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:38,340
fonts icons are what SVG is for don't

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,800
use our con fonts like a while back I

00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,350
was I was you know in Lebanon you can

00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,630
get really sucky and Turk on internet

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,400
connections they can get really slow so

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,400
I was opening my Twitter account on

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,800
desktop and I didn't get any icons I got

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,570
those small rectangles that you get it

00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,490
looks like Twitter devs are still not

00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,610
sold on using SVG icon systems even

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,290
though they should be so SVG icon

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,630
systems are just superior I mean you

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:06,300
need i say more

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,559
so if you want to start if i hopefully

00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,480
change your opinion and you

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,159
want to start using icon systems SVG

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,629
icon systems you can get started here

00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,730
I've written an overview of different

00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:17,039
sparking techniques on twenty four ways

00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,389
to org and Chris color has also returned

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,220
on CSS tricks and you can check these

00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:21,600
out as well

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,009
now okay I'm going to take this

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,440
opportunity this is not an advertisement

00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:28,320
or anything this is a genuine

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,580
recommendation I have written about

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,710
different spriting techniques but I

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,309
didn't get really into details into the

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,499
in that article but the Smashing book

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:40,259
number five is going on the pre-sale

00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:42,690
starts and and like four days from now

00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,850
or less I really recommend you get it

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,279
not because I have written an article in

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,749
there but then again because of that

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,509
article if you're interested in more in

00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:53,100
SVG I still get a lot of questions from

00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,289
people like okay I want to start using

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,480
SVG but I don't know how I don't know

00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:59,429
where to start the options that I have

00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,740
it's like they need a complete overview

00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:05,869
and so that they know where to start on

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:10,200
what to choose I've written a 23 K words

00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:11,700
chapter it includes so much so much more

00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,320
than I could cover in a talk or an

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,350
articles well I did cover it in an

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,789
article but I really recommend it if

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,980
you're if you if you're interested in

00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:21,779
learning about SVG that's my best SVG

00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,249
piece that I've written so far you can

00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:25,529
check it out the book is also going to

00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:29,070
contain a lot of loads of practical

00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:31,259
information about flexbox responsive

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,749
images etc so the point is if you're

00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,090
interested maybe you want to sign up and

00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:38,309
save the date and you know get the book

00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,799
when you can accessible data

00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:43,799
visualization and charts one common

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,619
thing is to use html5 canvas to create

00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,330
data visualizations and charts how many

00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:53,399
of you do that or have done it or have

00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:56,580
known someone who has okay so people

00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:58,820
tend to use sometimes html5 canvas to

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,619
create data visualizations and charts I

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,330
don't recommend that because the

00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:05,460
contents of an html5 canvas is not

00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,990
accessible basically the content of a

00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,359
canvas is just a bunch of pixels that

00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,829
you're rendering on the canvas it's not

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,889
accessible to screen readers they can't

00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:16,020
read that content so this is the number

00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,540
one disadvantage if you're going to

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,770
cater for readers or users with

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,970
disabilities you're going to have to

00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,859
provide fallback

00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,510
that we usually that would usually go

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:28,080
between the opening and closing canvas

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,460
tags okay but that would still there

00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,649
were that we would still have a problem

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,840
there because how would this how would

00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,460
the screen reader know what element on

00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,080
the campus the user interacted with

00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,520
there has to be some kind of linking

00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,899
between the two between the actual

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,540
content and the pro and the fallback

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:44,790
content so the html5 canvas task force

00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,639
added two new features two new methods

00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,690
to the html5 canvas specification that

00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,520
takes care of that

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,409
but even with that even with the

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,599
accessibility being enhanced for html5

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:56,099
canvas it's still a lot of work you're

00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,180
using it in modern browsers but even

00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,560
those modern browsers are going to

00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,880
require a fallback content and you're

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,130
going to have to maintain two sets of

00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,170
content to provide for users with

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,330
disabilities with SVG you don't have

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,680
that problem the contents of the SVG as

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,050
we mentioned before they are accessible

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,820
by nature they look great I remember

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,910
once seeing an example someone created

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,340
this 3d shape they created in a it's an

00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:19,200
html5 canvas and created the same exact

00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,990
same thing in SVG and then scaled both

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,130
up really high they scaled it so high

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:28,950
the html5 canvas look pixelated but SVG

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,390
did not so again a winner the content is

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,849
accessible you don't need to maintain

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,700
two sets of content and accessibility

00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:37,530
can even be enhanced more in SVG SVG has

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,490
also a set of accessibility features

00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:43,320
that help you enhance it even more so if

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,470
you're going to do any kind of data

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,260
visualization and charts using SVG d3.js

00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,300
is the most popular type popular library

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,790
so you might want to check it out if

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,320
you're into this and also there are a

00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,910
lot of SVG plugins that allow you to

00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,800
create different patterns that you can

00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,830
use with your charts to make them even

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,250
better and then animated diagrams I

00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:08,160
really really love Jake Archibald's work

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,470
on SVG he doesn't write about SVG a lot

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,380
but he does use SVG a lot he even check

00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,839
edited my my smashing back chapter he's

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,310
brilliant he knows so much about SVG and

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,560
even though he doesn't write but I got

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:22,560
to find that out from working with him I

00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,300
love how he uses them he has really

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,190
practical use cases for SVG it's not

00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,170
just about icon systems it's not just

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,670
about you know displaying some pretty

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,350
image that's going to scale everywhere

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,240
he uses them for

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,610
things like these this is the offline

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,500
cookbook he's using an SVG to create a

00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:40,440
diagram to illustrate how something

00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,940
works in this case serviceworker the

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,890
best part the my favorite part about

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,480
using SVG for this I didn't use SVG

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,700
before but I started using it recently

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,190
my articles I tend to do a lot of typos

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,660
a lot of mistakes so when I create an

00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,000
image and there's text inside it and

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,890
there's a typo there sometimes I might

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,410
need to have to recreate the same image

00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,180
again because of that misplaced letter

00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,530
or something with SVG you don't have to

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,240
worry about that you just get into the

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,960
SVG change the text and you're all set

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,540
and another advantage here is Jake and

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,180
this article Jake has a lot of diagrams

00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,540
and all of them use SVG and yet he was I

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,880
think it was it was a really really

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,500
small file size that he ended up with

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,650
and this is because of the reusability

00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,970
of SVG elements he had this one SVG

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,680
where I defined all of these main

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,530
components the five shapes here and

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,080
there are a few others and he just you

00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,820
reused them throughout the page so he

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,190
got all of the diagrams without all of

00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,590
the bloat code bloat and extra HTTP

00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:42,140
requests this is an excellent example

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:46,680
where SVG can be really useful now to

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:48,360
finish up SVG is great for freeform

00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,820
expression I'm really hoping for more

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,350
hands this time introverts raise your

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:59,840
hands what

00:37:54,350 --> 00:38:03,080
no hands seriously okay there's one okay

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,340
oh my god okay so this is me this is

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,570
gonna mean nothing to you except that

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,940
you might be able to understand

00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:11,510
introverts more this is an animation by

00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,240
Sarah Dresner it shows one of the real

00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,100
things that you can do with SVG if you

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,090
combine all of the ability to anime to

00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,770
transform to animate even text you even

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,080
have lighting effects in SVG by the way

00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,700
so if you combine all of the great

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,450
features of SVG you can end up with

00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,450
something like this

00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:48,050
some sound here would have been nice the

00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:50,270
silences how else we'll be able to

00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,589
create something so nice using a modern

00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:57,800
technology and don't even think about

00:38:51,589 --> 00:39:00,440
flash how else so this is great this is

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,900
SVG this is what you can do with SVG

00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,000
this is why you should be using SVG more

00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,089
this is why you should well you already

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,430
do maybe use it more build with SVG and

00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,880
have fun doing it and thank you so much

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,880
