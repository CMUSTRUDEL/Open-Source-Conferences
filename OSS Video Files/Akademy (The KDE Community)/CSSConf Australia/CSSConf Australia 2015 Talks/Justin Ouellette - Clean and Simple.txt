well it's great to be here in melbourn

00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,819
this has been a really cool conference

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,080
and I just want to thank really quickly

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,240
all the volunteers and organizers for

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,590
putting it on hand especially to bend

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,590
for inviting me out here from New York

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:21,330
so today I want to touch on two

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,939
interrelated concepts that come up

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,699
frequently in product design and that is

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,609
a clean and simple and they are

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,059
deceptively loaded words so I think

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:37,350
there's some real value in

00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:40,260
deconstructing them and analyzing why we

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,329
often cite them is desirable qualities

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,059
for websites mobile apps and you know

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:50,760
really anything that has a user a user

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:54,239
interface so for me the relationship

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,640
between clean and simple is very similar

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,010
to the relationship between form and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,320
function while they're often

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,430
interchangeable clean is usually more

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,580
appropriate to describe the way

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,290
something looks and simple is usually

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,110
more appropriate to describe the way

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,140
something works and since the way

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,990
something looks and the way it works are

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,250
infamously hard to separate we often

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,250
find these words describing the same

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,450
thing but it's possible and even useful

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,659
to think about them independently so

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,509
definitions are hard but let's just take

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,500
a stab at it and then we'll move on to

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,869
some examples so for me being clean is

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,939
really about being consistent it's about

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,450
being predictable and it's about being

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,479
rhythmic it means visual elements that

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,880
are laid out according to some plan

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,390
whatever that plan is it means finding

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,549
things where you expect them it means a

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,110
kind of visual flow that feels

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:01,200
frictionless and inevitable it doesn't

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,020
necessarily mean being flat it doesn't

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,590
mean shoeing skeuomorphism above all

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,789
being clean is about finding balance

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:15,730
and harmony on the other hand being

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:19,069
simple is about being singular

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,200
understandable and adaptable it means

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:24,830
finding the right tool for the job it

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,510
means making it easy to use and focus on

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,349
its task in such a way that it can be

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:34,580
easily integrated into a larger system

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:38,540
so let's look at some examples and some

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,340
are successful in some art first of all

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,400
I want to talk about MOOCs Dave just a

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,019
little bit I kind of swore that I

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,760
wouldn't talk about it again in public

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,090
but here I am right now talking about it

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,280
in the context of cleanest and

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:58,160
simplicity it's it's hard to avoid

00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,319
actually in 2015 we have a lot of flat

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,170
design I think when iOS 7 came out that

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,940
was kind of a big watershed moment for

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:11,180
flat minimal design but in 2007 the web

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,170
was a much different place the dominant

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,120
music platform at the time was my space

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:22,329
which has never been known for its clean

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,290
or simple design and in 2007 I was

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,579
thinking about the state of music on the

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,680
Internet it had been a few years since

00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:31,760
Napster and it was before Spotify before

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,459
a lot of the legal alternatives that

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,180
have come later and what I was really

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:41,120
interested in was the mixtape culture

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,060
that I had grown up loving so much in

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,829
the 90s before the internet I thought

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,739
the best way to discover new music was

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:51,560
to hear it from your friends and if they

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,900
took the time to put together a mix for

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,430
you it was kind of a special thing you

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,299
had this kind of physical object that

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,470
was sometimes decorated and personalized

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,810
but really what you're left with is a

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,389
set of music and an avenue to explore

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,989
other music and I thought that was great

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,780
and in 2007 there wasn't anything like

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:14,280
that

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,859
so what I never to do was make a system

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,720
that would kind of recapture that sort

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:26,580
of person to person passing of of music

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:30,389
and the way I achieved this was was mux

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,300
tape so it started off as just a list of

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,810
songs like a static list I was actually

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,880
a college radio DJ and every week I had

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,130
to log every song that I played on the

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,040
radio for two hours and I made a website

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:48,390
that just tracked all these playlists

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,190
and I love sending them to my friends

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,200
because they could kind of if they had

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,310
some of those songs going to repace the

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,950
Knicks together without me actually

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,660
having to send in the physical tape but

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,800
driven crazy that you couldn't actually

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,760
listen to the music on the site so I was

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,590
frustrated by this lack of

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,690
person-to-person contact and music on

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,389
the internet but also frustrated with

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,889
the state of user interface at the time

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,860
I didn't include an example of it but

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,440
2007 was a time of lots of gradients and

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,190
brushed aluminum and really heavy

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,040
skeuomorphism so what I started off with

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,260
was this kind of strip down list of

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,650
songs and I said what is the absolute

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,740
minimum i can do to make this into an

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,470
interactive experience and so just

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,840
working from there i expanded it out a

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,280
little bit i was like okay maybe you

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,020
want to be able to click on the songs to

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,030
play them but in that case there's not

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,560
the need for the kind of you I that you

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,360
have traditionally associated with music

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,669
there's no need for for instance a play

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,289
button rewind and stop these things were

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,760
sort of like rooted in the physical

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:59,340
world and so I got to a point very early

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,560
where I said this works just like it is

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,530
there's no reason to clutter it any

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,080
further and I kind of released it as

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,490
like just on a lark I had no real plan

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,810
for it it was just kind of like what's

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,740
just put this out there and see people

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,169
do with it and the way it worked was

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,539
very simple you've had a username sign

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,180
up for the site and the configuration

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,409
page was just a list of 12 upload boxes

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,569
good load any mp3 up from your

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,580
I upload it to the site and it would

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,319
make this list like this you were

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,729
limited to twelve songs kind of been

00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,979
keeping with the idea of a mixtape where

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,169
I wanted you to be able to focus on the

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:38,429
curation of the song and work within the

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:42,459
constraints of a limited playlist and

00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:45,219
then you could connect with other people

00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,569
who Ron Mueck state and favorite their

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,029
songs I'm sorry I favorite their

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:52,179
playlist and see all the playoffs that

00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:54,369
they had favored it and overnight it was

00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,019
this kind of like insane success like

00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:59,139
almost too successful because I

00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,419
attracted the attention of various

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,849
elements in the the record industry who

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:07,929
are not so happy about some of the

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:11,860
copyright consequences of a system like

00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:14,409
that but for me it wasn't about free

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,149
music it was about creating a better

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,969
experience for listening to music and

00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:20,439
part of that is discovering music that's

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,469
important because someone who's

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,519
important to you likes this music and

00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:27,099
also improving the experience just by

00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:31,329
making it a more beautiful thing to look

00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:33,699
at as it's playing MOOCs tape was a

00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,319
candle that burned bright and fast and

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:40,539
by the end of the summer it was gone and

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:45,099
we replaced it with a version that was

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:47,499
centered around making a site for bands

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,209
so at the time myspace again was like

00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:53,409
the default place to go like every man

00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:55,899
had a myspace page and we created the

00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:59,050
system that was similar but much better

00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:01,269
design much further reduced so part of

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,599
the myspace experience was that you

00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:06,909
could customize the HTML just totally

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,079
willy nilly whatever you wanted and it

00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,759
was crazy I mean it looked like

00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,110
geocities like it was nuts like some

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,099
people did some cool stuff but overall

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,149
it was just it was kind of a mess so in

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,639
keeping with the original mix tape

00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:21,550
design we kind of limited

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,340
what you could do with it and the

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,419
constraints actually have the effect of

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,710
blossoming a lot of interesting

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,870
creativity and people did all kinds of

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,370
interesting things the way it worked was

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,709
you had these different modules that you

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,279
could lay out and there was a picture

00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:38,860
module the actual playlist module

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:44,440
there's like a text box calendar and I

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:46,240
think that's about it and it was great

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,579
unfortunately it didn't work so much as

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,660
a business we never found out couldn't

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:50,949
really find her stride and I was a

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,790
little bit heartbroken honestly about

00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:57,910
what happened to the original version

00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:01,209
but for me it was a really important

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,060
thing to make a statement about what you

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:07,750
could do with very few design elements

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,510
and I think that since then we've seen a

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:15,640
lot of interesting products that kind of

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:18,760
like attack the same way so another one

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,029
of my favorite apps is clear which is

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,490
the to do list at some of you may have

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,370
seen this it's incredibly clean and

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,070
simple in fact it's almost new UI at all

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,709
it's it's entirely flow it's entirely

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,730
rhythm as you can see here you just I

00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,930
wish that included video and actually

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,230
because it had some beautiful animations

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,930
but it was really just about entering

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,279
these tasks could swipe them away pinch

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,230
open and create new lists all the

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,839
interaction was done without buttons

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,269
without sliders without setting with

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,839
boxes dialogues anything and I was

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:59,680
really kind of amazing another favorite

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:03,010
app mine is is kizi this is a music

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,110
making app for iOS again very very

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,540
simple almost new UI you have a grid of

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,120
colored boxes you can hold down a

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,449
colored box to start a short recording

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,220
and then once you've recorded a little

00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:20,730
sample into it you get this microphone

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,730
it's happening it again plays the sample

00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,490
supply

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,310
the supply iPad app it's another good

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:33,560
example of very very clean very simple

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:36,290
design in this case it really was a

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,300
great example of letting a Content kind

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,190
of rule the design which is something I

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,660
think that is a great strategy for

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,010
anything that involves content it's a

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,010
great thing to just get out of the way

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:53,060
so I want to talk about a few examples

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:58,400
of things that are clean but maybe not

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,610
so simple so this is from the movie

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,260
oblivion maybe some of you have seen it

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,830
for me this is a great example of an

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:11,300
extremely clean design it's very reduced

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:14,090
its there's a lot of rhythm to it but it

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,720
can't be fairly described as simple it's

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:22,460
a very information dense kind of

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,530
interface obviously it's not real but if

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,350
you were piloting a spaceship from the

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,930
future I think you'd probably have a lot

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:34,190
of input and information you'd want and

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:37,370
it would be very hard to reduce that

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,220
down into something that's much simpler

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,960
than what they have here and the point

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,500
that I want to make is that sometimes

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,300
that's okay sometimes things have like a

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,200
lower limit to their simplicity and

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:56,240
that's fine but it also means that there

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,730
is its extra important to achieve that

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,760
cleanness the more complicated something

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:08,570
is kind of the more you need to make it

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:12,110
clean to to compensate this is a website

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,720
called radar Matic that I built while I

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:18,800
was in the New York Times and it's a

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,720
it's a weather radar and this to me also

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,730
is a clean design but also not so simple

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,580
because it requires some level of

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,870
specialist knowledge there's not a lot

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,550
here to guide you into what you're

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,920
seeing unless you're kind of already

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,810
familiar with the domain of weather

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,750
detection and radar but again that's

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,720
okay

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,030
really the important thing is your

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,500
audience so if your user if your

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,900
audience has the specialized knowledge

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:50,250
you can kind of use it as a starting

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:53,070
level and build up from there another

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,880
good example of clean but not simple is

00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:00,330
the the famous New York parking sign

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:03,930
ness to me this is an example of a

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:06,360
failure it's certainly very clean but it

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,120
doesn't do anything to aid the

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,740
understanding of the user so it's a

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,630
failure there's nothing about being

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,800
clean guarantees that your design will

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:19,580
be a success so those some examples of

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,880
things that are simple but not clean

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:27,170
here's an antique elevator button from

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,490
the Renaissance I'm guessing and it is

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,510
very simple in its functionality it's

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,560
very clear what you're supposed to do

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,170
with this button you're supposed to push

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,430
it but I don't think you can call this

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:41,160
clean it's very ornate it's uh fits

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,920
within the context of the building it's

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,690
in but there's no reason that this has

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,150
to be clean it just has to be simple

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,430
another example is illuminated lettering

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:56,190
so this is the letter B very simple

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:59,339
functionally it's just the letter B but

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,500
from a design standpoint it is extremely

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,750
ornate it's not a clean design at all

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,730
it's very beautiful but there's no

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,510
reason that this has to be clean how

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,100
about some things that are neither

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,100
simple nor clean

00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:20,489
you may have seen some of these if

00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:22,559
you're at a certain age there's nothing

00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:24,389
clean or simple about this but I would

00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:29,699
argue that it's not a design failure

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:33,059
because it is key to its audience the

00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:35,939
rave flyer is something that is sort of

00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:38,639
like an insane expression of all the

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,499
maximalism and I guess like sensory

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,489
overload you would experience at the

00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:45,959
rave and for the user in this case the

00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:47,970
audience of someone who might be

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,600
interested in going to this rave it's

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:55,859
more important to sort of transmit the

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,119
feeling of the rave and a very clean

00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:59,119
simple design isn't going to do that

00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:06,269
another big pet peeve of mine is car

00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:09,509
stereos which hadn't actually improved

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:12,019
much since they started to be a thing

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:15,269
but this to me is just a terrible design

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:17,759
it is utterly confusing there's nothing

00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,799
familiar about it there's no play button

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,159
there's no stop button there's a SAP

00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:28,739
button I'm not sure what that does PTY

00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:35,100
cat who knows neither clean nor simple

00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:38,489
and it's a failure Adobe After Effects

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:42,289
is a classic example of like a

00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:46,199
specialist piece of software that is

00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:48,629
very difficult to make clean or simple

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,659
simply because it has extremely wide

00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:54,629
range of functionality and to simplify

00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,850
that much more would require alienating

00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,169
a user base that it's going to custom

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,689
these tools and invested a lot of time

00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:06,959
and sort of overcoming the complication

00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:12,779
of it occasionally the goal is to be

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:15,899
neither clean nor simple another example

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,489
from the 90s flashy boom boxes this is

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,749
neither clean or simple design I'm sure

00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:22,859
anyone could imagine a cleaner design

00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:25,619
for boom box but it's not quite a design

00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:28,649
failure because it achieves its purchase

00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:34,619
its purpose which is to kind of be

00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:36,839
flashy and that's just fine luxury watch

00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,129
is kind of the same thing for me um some

00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,699
things I've been interested in more

00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:43,649
recently because the Apple watch but for

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,179
me this is a watch that I would never

00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,009
wear and yet at the same time I

00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,169
understand that there are a lot of

00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:52,739
people who seek out this kind of design

00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:55,799
and for the watchmaker it makes sense

00:16:52,739 --> 00:17:00,509
for them to listen to their audience and

00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:02,879
to provide what they want Bloomberg

00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:06,149
terminal it's another classic example if

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,240
you're not familiar Bloomberg has these

00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:11,120
custom terminals that are an integrated

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,319
hardware software package that are

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,010
famously hard to use therefore for

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,949
financial analysts and reporters and the

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,209
idea is that you have all these constant

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,470
kind of streams of information coming in

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,549
about the financial market about World

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,639
News you can kind of see here there's

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:29,399
like a video window with CNN on and

00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:33,419
that's a custom keyboard with insane

00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:36,029
arcane functionality but the people who

00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,039
use these terminals love the fact that

00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:40,080
they're so complicated because it kind

00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,650
of sets them apart almost as like a

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,500
priestly class compared

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,270
other people so for them they actually

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,160
want it to be obtuse and complicated

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,470
because that satisfies their need to

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,660
kind of have their own cohesive group

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,510
that understands this technology and no

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,730
one else does so Bloomberg in this case

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,890
kind of intentionally makes the design

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:06,590
obtuse and I would argue that's not a

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:08,660
design failure either so it might be

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,790
helpful to think about clean and simple

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:15,320
in terms of their opposites and

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,230
depending on how you look at it you can

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,100
think of the opposite of clean as messy

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,130
and you can think of the opposite as

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,020
simple as confusing but those are only

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,350
in cases where you're in a situation

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,660
where the design is failing in some

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,030
respect and it's better to think about

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,130
the opposite of clean in terms of its

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,830
positive qualities so something isn't

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,540
clean it can still be good but a better

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,540
way to describe it than Messi might be

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,000
intricate ornate and for simple it's the

00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,550
same way it's not confusing I guess it

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,780
could be but a better way for it to be

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:53,510
not simple is for it to become

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:56,930
sophisticated what I'm really trying to

00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:00,910
get at is that clean and simple are not

00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,910
design goals in two and of themselves

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,400
instead I think it's more important to

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:13,370
strive for honesty and satisfaction in

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:17,030
design here's another great example TV

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:20,330
remotes kind of famously obtuse hard to

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,820
understand and in some ways I think

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,930
dishonest honesty is important in design

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:29,750
because in this case the goal of the

00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,340
remote is as much for the manufacturer

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,110
to communicate something about the

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,330
sophistication of the technology the TV

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,770
it may be for you as the user to

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,160
communicate to people over your house

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,470
that you have a very advanced system but

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,800
in terms of usability it kind of falls

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,010
short and we've seen that with the

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,280
alternative for instance the Apple TV

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,299
remote it's just amazing to me that you

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,309
can

00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,929
really reduce the functionality of

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:04,999
something that has all these buttons and

00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:07,549
maybe even an LCD screen to this another

00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:10,009
example is camera design cameras have

00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:13,809
become extremely complicated in a

00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:16,639
digital age and it's unfortunate because

00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,919
photography really is a function of

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:22,129
three simple things shutter speed

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,799
aperture and it's the film sensitivity

00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:26,450
the ISO rating and if you knew nothing

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,460
about photography I think you would look

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,929
at a camera like this and just be

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,600
utterly perplexed and maybe even turned

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:36,019
off to the whole concept but that's

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,330
unfortunate because there are successful

00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:40,279
designs that take just as good pictures

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,889
that don't involve any screens they

00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,519
don't involve any confusing you why this

00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:48,830
is a contact 645 and its really reduced

00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,350
all the functions of the camera down to

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,210
the very few controls that you need and

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,789
to me that's an expression of honesty

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,070
it's an honest expression of what

00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,919
photography is really about and it

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:06,409
translates very well into a very usable

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:09,619
design so what I'm really getting at is

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:12,679
that clean and simple are not so much

00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:14,389
design goals as they are emergent

00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,480
properties of a healthy design process

00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:19,879
or a subtractive design process they're

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:24,799
good goal posts to aim for but

00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:29,259
ultimately they are the result of clear

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,070
thinking and focusing on your user and

00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:34,940
sometimes that process doesn't even

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,710
constitute design I think a banana for

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,929
instance has an incredible user

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:43,309
interface it's easy to open it's got a

00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:45,980
protective shell that keeps your hands

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:48,619
from getting messy as you eat it and it

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,239
wasn't designed by anybody but it still

00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:58,669
has this emergent property of being

00:21:50,239 --> 00:22:00,740
simple and clean so

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:04,279
simplicity comes at the cost of power

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,309
it's important to strive for the most

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:10,980
simple possible solution to your problem

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:12,419
but it's also important to think of your

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,230
user think of your audience and think

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,230
about what they're trying to achieve

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:24,620
this is the cockpit of the space shuttle

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:27,000
which is fantastically complicated and I

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,159
don't know much about spaceship design

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,090
but I do know that it would be very

00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,260
difficult to reduce these controls to

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:39,840
something much simpler than what they

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:42,419
have and that's just fine it's it's okay

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,090
because the audience is the pilot of the

00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:47,610
spaceship who will have the specialist

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:50,520
knowledge required it's still clean I

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:53,190
guess as clean as it could be but it

00:22:50,520 --> 00:23:01,649
needs to be powerful and so there's some

00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:05,760
sacrifice to simplicity there and clean

00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:08,640
is a spectrum clean as as much in the

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,640
eye of the beholder as anything else

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,120
that's so subjective and you kind of

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,510
have a choice about how clean you want

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,880
things to be this is a great drawing by

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,880
Picasso the drawing exercise he did

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,890
where it's a bowl and with each

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,429
subsequent iteration of the drawing he

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,899
sort of reduces it to less and less of

00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,789
its essential elements until you're left

00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,669
with this just a couple lines and some

00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:39,570
shading and I think this is really

00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:42,029
beautiful because even though we're down

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,220
to a couple lines at the end it's still

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,500
Picasso there's still a lot of style in

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,340
there there's still a lot of like

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:53,520
personal energy well without being over

00:23:50,340 --> 00:24:00,720
stylistic without being or an important

00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,660
mentor II with for no reason this is a

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,400
gray

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,720
set of concept designs by a French

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,750
designer from about five years ago you

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,190
might have seen this online and he did

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,040
this for a bunch of different products I

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:15,460
think it was like a Pringles can a

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,470
condom box soda a couple other things

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,970
and he did this exercise where he took

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,190
the existing design and did a kind of

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,350
half reduced version and then a version

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,900
that was like reduced down to its

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,980
absolute bare minimum and this is really

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:34,810
cool because you can see that it's

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,480
possible to communicate the purpose and

00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:39,940
brand of the product with much less than

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,210
what they use and at the same time you

00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,490
can see that there's no clear answer for

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:50,080
what is the right level of cleanness

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,720
here again it's really about the context

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,240
of the audience and about the purpose of

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,460
the design in the case of store shelves

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,460
it's really important for products to

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,470
stand out and a lot of times being the

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,080
absolute cleanest most reductive

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,390
possible design isn't the best solution

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:17,650
doesn't help if you down sell any

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:19,150
products so I want to sum up with one

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,840
last thing here which is a quote from

00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:25,990
Jonathan Ive and he says simplicity

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,030
isn't just a visual style it's not just

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,740
minimalism of the absence of clutter to

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,980
be truly simple you have to go really

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,490
deep and what he's talking about here

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,200
actually is the number of screws in the

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,750
macbook air I think he's talking about

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,670
reducing the number of screws and the

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,740
point he's making is that if they had

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,410
set out to just reduce the number of

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,520
screws they could have gone about that

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,590
in all kinds of different ways that

00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,470
would have actually overcomplicated the

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,810
design of the computer but instead the

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,380
goal of Apple isn't to get rid of screws

00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:01,600
it's to make the laptop lighter cooler

00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:06,220
to make the manufacturing process more

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,700
efficient and the lack of screws is an

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,700
emergent property

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,320
and if you take anything home from this

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:20,019
I want it to be that it's that it's more

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:22,519
important to focus holistically on

00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:25,039
reducing your design down to its core

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,519
elements and thinking about what is

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,389
honest and what will satisfy your user

00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:35,110
rather than just getting rid of the

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:35,110
