	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
I'm here to talk to you about open

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,779
source design and that's me when I had

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,370
longer hair I swear I did but I picked

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,559
this little cartoons i'm holding a book

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,660
and before i was preparing this

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,580
conference I thought what do I really

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,830
like to see when I go to conferences in

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,990
c talks and i thought you know i really

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,060
like to see stories so this just could

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,740
be story time with yuna get ready um

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,599
this noise story is about this guy and

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,730
you may not have heard of him he's kind

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,130
of underground up-and-coming name is

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,590
Bill Gates he is the co-founder of

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,780
Microsoft and we're going to talk a

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
little bit about his life so Bill Gates

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,489
was born into a pretty wealthy family

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,960
his father was an attorney his

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,030
great-grandfather actually started the

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,469
first national bank and his mother was

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,410
the boards of some very prestigious

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,140
nonprofits so bill is obviously this

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,199
really intelligent boy he was sent at 13

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,890
years old to lakeside school in

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,039
Washington which was a really

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,960
prestigious high school but the really

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,520
interesting thing about this school is

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,320
that they had a mothers club that had

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,619
this remer sale and they raised three

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,430
thousand dollars in 1968 to buy a block

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,119
of computer time and a teletype ASR 33

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,490
so this high school had a access to a

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,830
computer terminal computer time in a

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,720
year that most colleges universities had

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,180
no such thing had no kind of computer

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,369
program this is 1968 but they had it at

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,530
their high school so third team Bill

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,119
Gates had this kind of access also they

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,369
happen to live right across the street

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,470
from Washington University that's um

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,619
Bill Gates and Paul Allen on their

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,090
systems where they would sneak into the

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,490
University and kind of like sneak

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,990
computer time where they could so Bill

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,540
Gates was gone between three and six

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,310
a.m. from his house often he was at this

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,899
university trying to figure out where he

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,640
could sneak computer time on the system

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,740
became very obsessed with learning

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,020
computer languages his first one was

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,369
basic and they actually exploit some

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,360
bugs in the system to the point where

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,290
they got kicked out of using this

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,350
computer to the school because time was

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,570
expensive but people did realize that

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,340
they were pretty brilliant boys so the

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,030
end up getting job were they exploited

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,170
bugs for computer time so they were the

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,090
first beta tester

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,410
of the system by the computer

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,480
corporation and they were just

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,550
encouraged to play with it and break it

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,980
as much as I can they had all of this

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,530
experience it's so much time on these

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,209
computer systems they had 10,000 hours

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,390
of practice before they even graduated

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,980
high school and the coolest thing about

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,440
that is that it was a community that

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,060
surrounded Bill Gates that allowed for

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,790
the PC revolution to be what it is today

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,650
it was not an individual it was all of

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,200
us it was it was his mother it was his

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,750
school it was his location it was the

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,459
people around him so like isn't that

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,610
awesome well this cat says no and this

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,470
cats run the internet and so everything

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,519
on the internet is correct and obviously

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,500
the answer is no logical oops the answer

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,580
is no because it was just one kid and

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,709
when he was interviewed later he

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,450
admitted he was probably the only 13

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,610
year old in the world that had that kind

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,459
of access at the time but what if there

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,760
were 20 kids like Gates who had that

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,110
kind of access what if there were 20

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,549
people who had very different

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,859
backgrounds different mindsets different

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,109
opinions who had the same kind of access

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,959
who could get that same kind of practice

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:27,269
in what if there were 200 people or

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,980
2,000 people can you imagine what kind

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,870
of technology we'd be using today if we

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,579
had allowed for a world that had more

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,140
than one Microsoft that had people

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,350
competing and working together to create

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,970
technology and products the world that

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,769
we could have is much richer than the

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,090
world we've settled for and this comes

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,100
from Malcolm Gladwell who wrote about

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,220
gates in his book outliers it was a

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,959
really good book recommend you read it

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,640
so right now we have the open source

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,250
initiative which is another community

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,840
and historically technological

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,150
revolutions have happened in one of

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,769
three ways the first way is through

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,959
government subsidies so this is how we

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,150
have the ENIAC computer where the

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,260
government decides this is for the good

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,910
of the people so we're going to put

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,829
money into it and have people work on it

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,680
the second is through large corporations

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,690
so like a labs and Xerox PARC where they

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,670
can afford to bring together really

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,350
brilliant minds and create technological

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,239
revolutions and their third way is

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,270
through open source so like Wikipedia

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,780
Firefox a lot of really brilliant

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,930
initiatives that are even happening

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,940
today are happening

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,889
just to the contributions of each other

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,120
and through the open sores like new and

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:35,650
Linux so one thing that's kind of

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,810
missing is the designers like where the

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,370
designers at right now open source is a

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,870
lot of developers and it's great it's

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,300
brilliant but we're missing an entire

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,039
different mindset that could be taking

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,030
the world of open source from what it is

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,860
to what it could be and the next story

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,810
is sorry the road so this comes from

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,639
Google's design founders and they have

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,560
this program with their linking

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,300
designers with developers and creating

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,220
startups together and what I really like

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,139
about the story is that includes three

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,639
characters so you have a business person

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,130
you have an engineer and you have a

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,160
designer so the business person says I

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,050
have an idea musical 2 road we need to

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,710
build a road to get from point A to

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,900
point B okay that's fine the engineer

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,330
says great let's build it with this

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,770
super new like high-end stripping agent

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,110
so we won't have to do any kind of

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,520
repairs this road for years and years to

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,780
come it'll be great for a hundred years

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,270
it'll be good for the economy awesome so

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,039
then the designer comes in and says that

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,539
all sounds good let's also build this

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,360
road in the coast that people can enjoy

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:39,039
the ride for years and years to come so

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,490
it takes all of those minds to come

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,380
together and to create the best solution

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,110
another example of this i really like is

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,550
the bay lights in san francisco and i

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,740
didn't know this existed into my last

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,630
trip there and i was just mesmerized by

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,340
this so a lot of the time when people

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,169
think about San Francisco they think of

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,990
the Golden Gate Bridge that big red

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,270
structure that's iconic classic image of

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,520
San Francisco but now there's a slight

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,970
installation on the bay bridge that are

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,860
tons and tons of huge LED bulbs that map

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,710
to there's there's no image of them

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,030
working that's a good they there's a

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,280
program and see that was written that

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,979
actually reads different data around the

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,560
bridge like traffic patterns current

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:23,099
blow the bridge the fish and it maps to

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,039
creating these really beautiful LED

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:28,330
displays along the bridge and they're

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,860
put on the bridge in a way that the cars

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,210
that are driving aren't distracted like

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,620
they're angled in certain ways and

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,659
there's just another really great

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,460
example of bringing design and

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,380
engineering together to create something

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,470
beautiful and this is originally a

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,010
project that was only suppose

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,930
last two years but as of this month they

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,770
crowdfunded this is the biggest civic

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,660
crowdfund project ever to actually take

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,400
down the lights and put them up for

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,290
another 10 years in a more permanent

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,370
installation because people love them so

00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,410
much so I'm going to ask again where the

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,150
designers at let's take a look at some

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,530
of the barriers of why designers aren't

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,070
contributing to open source right now

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,050
and there's a designer I found one this

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,850
is mike Montero and he shares a

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,270
sentiment that a lot of designers have

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:18,680
and that sentiment is you pay me so

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,530
he gave a really awesome creative

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,080
morning's talk in san francisco in 2011

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,630
became a really famous talk and it was

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,540
exactly that it was why designers have

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,550
this knee-jerk reaction to being asked

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,230
to do free work they often feel

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,140
undervalued for their work and it's not

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,640
as objective as development so they have

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,320
this you pay me mentality that

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,180
we're teaching designers from design

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,270
school onwards this is something that we

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,980
have to overcome the second one is what

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,070
i like to call the museum effect it's

00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,080
where you walk into this really like

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,790
unknown place this is why i feel like

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,430
sinus don't really understand could have

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,260
that well it's just same things that are

00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,669
unknown and when things are unknown you

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,440
don't want to touch anything because you

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,479
don't want to break anything this is out

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,800
of goodwill you just don't want to mess

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,150
up someone else's system you know they

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,710
pull off hard work into it and you're

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,120
worried that touching something is going

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,200
to mess it up so you just don't touch it

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,240
at all the third is called unfamiliarity

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,800
paralysis and this image makes no sense

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,910
but it just worked well with the text so

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,860
go with it um so this is kind of

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,940
opposite of what happens in the friend

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,430
world where we don't have enough

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,110
frameworks choose from right so when you

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,610
don't even know what's out there how do

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,290
you choose like when you don't know how

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,150
to get started how do you get started

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,570
that's what this whole unfamiliar area

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:38,750
paralysis is then there's designed by

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,490
committee which oh just the words in

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,400
themselves I don't know if I need to

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,510
explain this it's just frustrating when

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,000
you're trying to please everyone you

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,360
please nobody so at this point if I'm a

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,070
designer I'm thinking not for me why

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,030
would I get involved in that no thank

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,410
you

00:08:53,030 --> 00:09:01,640
no and this is also an example of what

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,680
happens when you have people saying like

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,750
oh let's let's build a logo for

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,280
something so this is I ojs and one of

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,510
the things they decided to do on github

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,190
was have this logo issue right so at

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,520
first it I think it begins

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,730
well-intentioned and there are people

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,640
who are submitting decent logos it keeps

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,730
going what makes me sad is there are a

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,400
lot of really good submissions in here

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,890
they're also mixed in with these people

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,770
trolling like it gets a little insane

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,750
I'm just gonna let you watch this for a

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,000
moment because it's really entertaining

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,800
and I tried to speed up in a moment like

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,320
just go as fast as i Ken down this page

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:54,500
but it takes so long and it points

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,030
people are like I kind of like the

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,810
Jupiter planet you know we're getting

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,550
somewhere I mean I think we were there's

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:11,690
an eyeball in there I don't there's

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:14,270
sausage enough said so this just keeps

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,130
going and going people put t-shirts I

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,180
think people make business cards at one

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:27,350
point yeah so you know I ojs issue

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:28,820
number 37 enjoy Ella so as much as I

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,680
want to sit here and watch the rest of

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,860
this there was if anyone caught that

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:39,620
like Snow White dollars I a globe um

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,470
let's move on from this to our last

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,330
barrier which is that it's just not in

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,250
the peripheral and this is where I get

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,260
to ask you some questions how many of

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,450
you are a designer or no a designer who

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,330
works on an open source project raise

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,340
your hands okay so there there a couple

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,890
of you out there that's great keep your

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,200
hands raised and the second question is

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,450
how many of you know a designer who

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,040
works in open source who is not also a

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,450
front-end developer who doesn't like

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,640
write code themselves

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,560
okay a couple hands went down most hands

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,840
but how many of you know a designer who

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,700
works in open source that didn't get

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,840
into it from their friend who said oh I

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,020
have this project I want you to work on

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,270
who's kind of discovered it on their own

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,070
okay I think I see like two hands now

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,530
but this is a problem it's just not a

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,820
part of the design workflow it's a part

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,010
of the development workflow but how do

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,050
you bring it into the world design if

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,950
you want their opinions and mindsets to

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,990
join in your product so let's do things

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,610
about it all right with this really cool

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,040
rainbow text the class is called rainbow

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,310
me in this presentation by the way in

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,990
fact so I'm also a core member of a

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,090
organization called design open and we

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,890
kind of have two goals for getting

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,960
designers and developers forum source

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,240
and the first is to encourage a more

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,000
open designer developer workflow so

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,680
instead of a designer just taking an

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,120
idea going to a coffee shop for two

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,070
weeks and the presenting their final

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,100
product they're working in the open and

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,020
showing you that process as they go the

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,400
second one is to foster design

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,200
participation in the open source

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,850
community as it was kind of mentioning

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,550
earlier so let's take a look at that

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,770
first one me a solution for that was

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,380
good I think it's great has great

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,990
versioning and issue handling and file

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,880
Asset Management's and I really loved

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,130
working with kit but I know that a lot

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,150
of the time when designers think of the

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,520
word get they just think that I'm trying

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,640
to watch my language here I swear um and

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,290
I really wanted them to feel how I felt

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,800
about get I wanted them to think that

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,500
get was their friend so I wanted to try

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,740
this on my team and I created this gulp

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,330
starter environment and what I did was I

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,190
just tried to create a set of tools that

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,650
will be really helpful as the designers

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,050
that I worked with so this includes SAS

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,420
already set up out of prefix or CSS

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,000
minification bunch of performance

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,890
optimization tools and browser sink

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,420
which is magical so whenever you can

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,880
choose to me the browser sink is just

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,380
like the whole world changes and so all

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,350
they had to do really was install node

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,090
and then user terminal and like use gold

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,760
I really want them to use our terminal

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,590
and get used to that so I set this up I

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,720
thought it was great idea and then I

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,070
convinced my team to my guinea pigs and

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,010
try it out so

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,240
like designers and I said hey don't

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,420
worry like i'll be your safety net

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,980
that's trampoline but we could pretend

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,290
and i finally convince them like yeah

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,960
sure i pry this environment for you just

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,430
try it out doesn't work it's fine so of

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,550
course this is the first thing that we

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,930
see and that's reaction I get one of the

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,600
designers that I first introduced us to

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,670
his name is Ryan it comes to me you know

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,830
i just broke my computer what's going on

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,590
here you can't see it but this is just

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,120
like a node error where it's looking for

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,070
the modules like they didn't NPM install

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,020
something super common something I CL

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,700
time but if you don't know what's

00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,830
happening and you don't use terminal

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,380
often and all of a sudden you see these

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,850
red like blinking lights happening on

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,660
your computer like of course you think

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:09,180
holy my computer's broken um I said

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,340
Brian don't worry I've broken everything

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,020
like I've broken my computer so bad that

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,060
my server company has paid me money

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,860
because they didn't know how I did it

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,520
like I got paid money because I broke my

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,050
server at that bad don't worry we'll fix

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,640
it we'll get through it together trust

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,990
me you doing way better than me there

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,550
was a lot of positive reinforcement

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,900
there so this is our work chats and like

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,300
things started to happen I'll read this

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,850
to you so Ryan messages me and says yay

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,160
successfully pushed code by myself I

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,340
updated the readme and I was just like

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,810
yes corgi butts best desk if ever so it

00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,320
was just all of the little things that

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:48,030
we we celebrated and this hashtag little

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,950
wins this thing that we started using on

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,620
my team for every time we just had

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,810
little little wins when a designer was

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,430
learning development and then this is

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,250
brittany who actually coined that

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:02,430
hashtag another designer on my team and

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,670
she messages me and Ryan it was like ten

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,710
o'clock p.m. on a sunday and she says I

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,500
downloaded you know start environment on

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,180
my own again LOL and added a SAS

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,540
attribute to change the text to

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:19,860
Helvetica hashtag little wins hahaha I'm

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:24,540
freaking out okay bye that's the best

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:27,120
message I ever got and then this is ryan

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,090
who who said taught another designer get

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,220
today education is so contagious thanks

00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,480
you know crazy i think i learned get to

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,279
eat

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,380
ago we call it for education with his

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:42,170
front end development education we think

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:43,880
we're clever but yeah he learned get two

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,279
weeks ago he's already teaching other

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,420
designers that's so exciting this is

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,800
what happens we don't make assumptions

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,970
and you don't assume that designers

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,389
don't care and don't want to get

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,940
involved in this world and I decided

00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:57,230
like telling the designer they need to

00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,029
learn how to code it's just gonna make

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,709
them defensive and just gonna make them

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,269
try to explain to you why they don't

00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,070
need to learn how to code but when you

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,470
get them really excited about what you

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,240
do it makes them curious and when you

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,040
have designers coming to you and asking

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,750
you to set up their system that's when

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,970
you win that's when you've got them and

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,260
this yeah I said this so I had to have

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,699
this emoji at the end because I felt

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:22,160
like it was necessary so now my entire

00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,079
team is actually on github so our UX

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,170
designers are developers project

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,880
management everyone we have research on

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,060
there it's been a really great way to

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,350
increase transparency among our team see

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,880
what everybody is working on keep

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,860
organized it's been a really awesome

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,709
system for just managing our projects

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,319
and working in the open and we're also

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,760
not afraid to iterate so this this is a

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,690
week like one of my favorite gifts

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,360
because it's just like my knowledge

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,600
sharing gifts and i love it i feel like

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,829
it's exactly what's happening right now

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,170
so i talked about encouraging a more

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,060
open designed developer workflow and i

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,560
want to talk about how to foster design

00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,149
participation in the open source

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,920
community which i think is a little bit

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,240
trickier because it's one thing with my

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,380
team it's another thing when i'm trying

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,290
to bring other people onto my project so

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,870
i thought of four pillars of a good

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,579
inclusive open source project

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,290
communication accessibility respect and

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,230
empathy and we're going to start with

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,390
communication so communication is kind

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,860
of about how do i tell somebody that i

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,959
want help in the first place how do they

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,929
find my project how do they know and

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,610
what really needs to happen is a job

00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,559
board or project board to kind of

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,200
connect designers and developers but for

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,120
now what we can do is label issues as

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,130
design needed or design so that

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,679
designers can go on to github and search

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,630
for issues of design needed so they know

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,429
what projects are asking for their help

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,130
and then they feel like they're not just

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:48,170
submitting like I've listed redesigns

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,820
which happens a lot of the time now like

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,460
redesigns of facebook when you could be

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,710
making something that is useful in the

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,720
open source community so if we have

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,530
these labels then they know where to

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,350
search also if you're going to create

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,320
issues with labels it's really good to

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,090
use the system of check mark like check

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,520
boxes in github which is one of my

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,960
favorite features because you can

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,030
actually go in and check them off and

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,980
it's just a markup thing that github

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,900
does and then when you're looking at all

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,090
of your issues in general and might be a

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,010
little bit small to see but there's a

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,510
bar on the bottom that actually

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,640
corresponds with how many checks you

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,080
have checked off so if you have 3x6

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,700
checked off it says the issues fifty

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,110
percent complete I think that's just

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,710
another really nice feature that github

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:38,660
has this is a project that's github and

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,100
gmail and what I like about it is it

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,320
really explains what's happening this

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,090
project and what's going on I like how

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,220
they use these big red boxes and they're

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,570
explaining it's just a lot more lucid

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,680
for me to understand what's going on

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:54,080
when I land on this page in this project

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,850
so using a lot of images is great and we

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,530
use a lot of images on my team when

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,230
we're discussing design plan our issues

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,540
as well this is a talk that I gave with

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,490
Ryan and we were just kind of talking

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,770
about color palettes and what we do is

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,780
every time we're discussing something we

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,490
just do a quick screenshot of a ping

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,950
throw it up and then we has thing to

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,350
discuss and a question that I get pretty

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,390
often about this open-source like github

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,570
workflow is well what about your big

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,880
like PS to use in your AI assets so what

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,950
we do there is will link to like a

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,630
dropbox account with that asset but also

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,200
take a screenshot so we have a visual

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,240
reference of what we're talking about so

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,700
accessibility is the next point and

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,790
accessibility what I mean here is in

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,380
terms of can i use your project can i

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,690
get started with it do I know what it is

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,250
in the first place so getting started

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,230
documentation is really important and

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,180
another reason why I feel like github is

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,670
just not really welcoming to designers

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,670
yet is because all the time this is what

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,830
we see we land a page if we even have

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,220
that that's that's why my repos so like

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,570
guilty as charged learn my ways it just

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,790
makes a lot of assumptions

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,170
and like NPM install gold like these are

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,900
things that you're assuming somebody

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:08,210
knows and what's even worse is one time

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,800
I was contributing to a project and I

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,130
submitted a pull request with

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,390
documentation and I said like you don't

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,640
really say that you need to bundle

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,170
install and the response I got was oh we

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,490
have a gem file you know that's just

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,950
expected that you should go to do that

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:25,030
it's just like oh do you want people to

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,370
work on this or not is open source and

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,960
this is a better example it gives you a

00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,060
little bit more documentation but again

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,530
I have no idea what this project is

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:37,400
doing up front um it has um some place

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,380
that I can go to get more information

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,030
but it would be really great if I just

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:47,750
saw it immediately like what what do you

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,190
want me to help you up so in my little

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,360
Gulf started environment I had some

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,520
pretty detailed getting started

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,440
documentation and this is something that

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,320
I probably iterated most on in the

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,660
entire project whenever any designer had

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,070
a problem or ran into any snag I wanted

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,780
to hear about it so I can go back and

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,120
iterate on these document on the

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,560
documentation and correct it's that for

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,710
the next person that we better say

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,410
wouldn't run to the same issue so

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,930
contribution documentation here's a good

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,670
example Brielle's guys makes it really

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,920
easy to contribute they talk about how

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,500
to use github to report issues and just

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,090
have a really detailed explanation of

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,420
different ways to contribute to this

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,800
project and I think that's pretty great

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,660
so a lexicon is another thing that you

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,220
can do I mean how often does it happen

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,780
that people are talking with the same

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,640
word but have two different definitions

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,250
of it and there are so many different

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,050
terms when it comes to the dev world

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,420
that we just expect people to know that

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,100
if you have a lexicon thought of your

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,930
project or have a different file for it

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,520
everyone can reference that and you all

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,460
are on the same page about what you're

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,260
talking about so I did that I called a

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,090
commonly confusing terms because this is

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,770
for designers who are just getting into

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,630
learning code so I kind of explain

00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,240
everything on there from like what CD

00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,680
means what repo is what sudo means like

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,620
what it means when you're doing that to

00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,690
your computer gulp dist SCSS like what

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,230
pack isn't JSON is I want them to

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,610
understand what was going on so respect

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,389
is next one and we're going to talk

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:17,049
about another tech hero

00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,700
jobs and you know fun fact 1955 is a

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:20,349
great year to be born if you want to be

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,149
like a tech entrepreneur a billionaire

00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:24,849
because steve jobs and bill gates are

00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:27,129
both born the same year but Steve really

00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:29,289
respected design he thought of that as

00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:31,989
like the cornerstone of what Apple was

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:34,419
they would not settle for anything less

00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,950
than his ideas and he really respect

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,589
designers and understood that they were

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,779
an integral part of his product from the

00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:43,119
start so just having that respect has

00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:45,489
really transformed Apple and made it the

00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,079
corporation huge company that it is

00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,299
today that gives us the computers that

00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:53,019
we use so that's pretty awesome thanks

00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:55,329
to you design is not just what it looks

00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,889
and feels like design us how it works so

00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:59,619
I want to encourage you to not just ask

00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:02,139
someone to make an icon or skin a page

00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:04,239
for you introduce them to your entire

00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:06,999
process and allow them to become a part

00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:09,279
of that coordination does not equal

00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:10,989
collaboration and coordination is great

00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,209
github is a great coordination tool

00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:15,070
getting your team all lines but when you

00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:16,869
allow yourself to really collaborate and

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,459
bring these other viewpoints into your

00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,619
project it can really change the

00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:24,339
trajectory of what you're expecting to

00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:26,259
create and last one is empathy which is

00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:27,909
a really fun word that people like

00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:31,239
they're around but it's really important

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:32,829
so fun fact empathy is an evolutionary

00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:35,109
tactic I just like bearing fun facts in

00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,459
there um it's why we care for people

00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,429
when they're sick like we care for our

00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:43,049
family because then our genes get better

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:45,909
we learned to beat that virus and we

00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:47,409
further the gene pool so that's what

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:48,789
empathy was there for from the beginning

00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,440
so treat people who are working on your

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:54,599
open source project like your family and

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,599
don't be this guy the well actually

00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:01,659
nobody likes that guy so feedback

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,369
guidelines are something that are great

00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:06,759
to have and I've got a few pointers here

00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:08,139
so ask don't tell if somebody submits a

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,570
pull request and you're commenting on

00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:12,070
their pull request ask them like why did

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,769
you decide to include this bit of code

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,200
why why'd you do that don't tell them

00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:19,509
like this is wrong that just shuts them

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,549
down instantly the second one is be very

00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:23,529
specific so asked like why did you

00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:25,030
decide to do that online 33 when you're

00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,940
calling the move

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,670
question for instance explain yourself

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,440
um so say like oh I would do this

00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,150
instead because I read this blog post

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,820
makes a lot of sense or explain why

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,800
you're not going to accept that code or

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,080
why you have better idea on how to do

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,980
that and then offer solutions like maybe

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,710
try doing this instead avoid hyperbole

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,180
of saying you should never do this this

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,040
is terrible what are you even doing

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,140
submitting code to this project you're

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,910
useless because that doesn't make anyone

00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:03,430
happy and then use emojis because

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:05,140
because a you can and be because it

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,920
really does just make everything better

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,370
there's so I was staying in acid in a

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,540
hostel in the Sydney two days ago and

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,100
there was a bed that was like perfectly

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,570
made so I put my stuff on it and I come

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,550
back there's note that says I moved your

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,650
stuff because i was sleeping here last

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,720
night smiley face and i didn't get mad

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,860
because there was a smiley face like the

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,120
only reason why is because there's my

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,300
face look I just like to make his bed

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,640
there's nothing wrong with that so um

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,530
communication accessibility respect and

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,000
empathy and I really hate myself for

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:40,690
doing this but it just kind of happened

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,070
it made this acronym I swear I just had

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,590
to rearrange to the words to make it

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,360
work but it makes sense like if you care

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,680
about your project if you care about

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,780
this community and if you care about

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,460
what you do you're going to want other

00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,060
people to contribute you're going to

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,710
want to bring these other minds into it

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,260
so the last story is about all of you

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,550
and it's about what we do now it's a

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,470
further this community and make it more

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:07,000
inclusive and I'm sorry I stole these

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,680
pictures off Twitter so get over it yeah

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,380
it's about what we do here and so I'm

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,630
really excited to have been here to talk

00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,180
to all of you I just want to say thank

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,650
you there are some resources I occluded

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,390
from this talk and there's my twitter

00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,130
handle have I would love to talk to

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,340

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,340
