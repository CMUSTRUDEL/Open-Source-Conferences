Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	Metaphors are an essential means of communication and method of teaching for developers. Without them and Lin Clark, it would be much more difficult for teams to adopt Redux. But learning by association has its limits. When we only discuss the things we can relate to we reinforce existing stereotypes that box us in. Instead of thinking outside the box, we will discuss how thinking about the box itself is the key to breaking down our unconscious bias. Together we will learn how to dismantle the concepts that divide us, techniques for better engaging with people of all backgrounds, and how to empower the systems we work in to be even more performant than our code.
