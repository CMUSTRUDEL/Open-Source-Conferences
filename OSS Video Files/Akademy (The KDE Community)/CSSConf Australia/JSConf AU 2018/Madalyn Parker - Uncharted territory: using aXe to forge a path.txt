Description: 
	I remember attending my first JSConf in 2014 and watching Marcy Sutton talk about accessibility and the Shadow DOM. I was hooked on creating an accessible web for everyone. However, it's really hard to get accessibility prioritized when you're running as a lean startup.

Years later, my company is ready to hop on the train and now we're working to implement the first ever ADA compliant chat box used in a support and sales context. I've seen lots of talks on accessibility basics and implementing aria on static sites, but few that demonstrate what it's actually like to approach a codebase architected without accessibility in mind (especially one that will run on sites you have no control over) and add that layer in.

I'm working on this project now (with a due date of Dec 2017) so I don't have immediate outcomes to list here but I'll cover the problems I ran into and will hopefully be able to help other developers in similar situations with their code bases.

I want to show that it's okay to roll out accessibility changes bit by bit, that it doesn't have to be all or nothing, and that there are good tools out there to help you out. I think the stumbling blocks I come across (and overcome) in this project would be useful for others who find themselves in my position. Part of what made this project difficult was my inability to accurately estimate how long or how much work it would take to update our application. Hopefully, with the lessons I learn, Iâ€™ll be able to help someone else blaze their own trail at their company.
