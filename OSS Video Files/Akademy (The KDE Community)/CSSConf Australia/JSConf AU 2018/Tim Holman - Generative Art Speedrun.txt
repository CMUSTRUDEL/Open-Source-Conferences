Title: Tim Holman - Generative Art Speedrun
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	For so many of us, myself included, the art world is the entry point into the coding world. Here we will explore ins and outs of generative art, and experience the joy of creating art with code. Generative art can be as simple or complex as you like, at the end of the day, everyone will have the mindset and processes down to create their own unique pieces of joy.

This talk begins with the basics of generative art, a small history, including some of the earliest "code art", proceeding into examples through history leading us here. The goal of the "speed run" is to give the audience as much knowledge about generative art as possible in the given time, while also showing the tooling, and surprisingly few steps it takes to get creating unique and original art. Generally speaking, there is no limitation to the audience of this talk, it really sits on the borderlines of people who enjoy art, code and science, and everyone will take home a different piece of that puzzle.

The talk shows both the simplicity and beauty of generative art, with just a few lines of code, we can put the computer to work creating millions of unique pieces.

	hi hey wow it's awesome to be heresingle these smiling faces you mighthave seen me around I'm kind of full offull of energy so I've been doing a lotof dancing about I am Tim let's justkind of go through the you know theadmin there's my website there's myTwitter there's my github there's myLinkedInthere's my code pen it's it's it's crazyactually it's my first time speaking inAustralia these these are my avatarsthroughout the last throughout the lastfive years and if you do it backwards itkind of looks like a budding youngsoftware developer slowly start toquestion his life choices the softwaredevelopment not even onceand if it goes forward it's kind of likemy hair is growing growing out which isnice you may know me from the internetI've done a ton of stuff I'm always kindof making five or so years ago I madethis website you would press this buttonand it would kind of take you to randomwebsites online this one's called Elopcalm and you slap a person with simpleweb development and I made this websiteand got super popular and I was kind oflike whoa I started to get enamored bythings online and I started just wantingto make things and make things and makethings and make things this is a websitethat I have inspiring dot online and Ijust kind of post things on there when Isee something funI made this font just last year for fora look written for a js' comfy you it'scalled smell vodka it's beautiful youcan install it on your machine andreplace the redundant Helvetica you knowyou might have seen these github cornersonline they kind of wave when you whenyou hover over them that was me it's funto see those kind of all over the webthis is something that I made a coupleyears ago you kind of scroll down andyou want to go back to the top of thescreen[Music]beautiful right you might know me frommy LinkedIn profile full of dog picturesyeah so I do a lot of stuff online andtoday I'm here to talk about generativeart generate vada holds a special placein my heart because it was kind of thereason that I got into development inthe first place it kind of provided anavenue to look at things and make thingswithout directly kind of comparingmyself to all these fantastic developersout there and kind of going ah thiswebsites so good this is so so advancedwhy can I kind of do that so back intothe kind of admin stuff generative artis that in part or whole has beencreated with you some autonomous systemand an autonomous system is a systemwhere it's kind of out of your hands forexample you could roll a dice and dosomething different each role and thatis an autonomous system and a speedrunis a playthrough of a game with theintention of completing it so I'm goingto teach you how to complete softwaredevelopment you won't have to doanything after this but no for me thespeed run aspect of this is to kind ofgive you enough information to say hey Ican I can create something like this Ican do it and and and kind of geteverybody on their own making their ownstuff so these are the steps I want tobreak it down I want to break downcreating some generator BOTS and I wantto put it into small small pieces thatare very digestible I'm very easy tounderstand unlike me because I can'tstop speaking really quickly I want toshow the experimental nature of code andkind of draw some parallels betweengenerative art and regular softwaredevelopment and then finally I want tokind of get a little bit introspectivethis was kind of something that I liketo do in my talks where I put somethingtogether and when you're making a talkyou're thinking so much about all theseaspects of software development and Ican't help myself but then put that inthe talk and a kind of inception thingit's awesome so I want to introduce thisidea of a tool belt and we use a toolbelt when we're developing always whenyou start off you have very few thingsin your tool belt and as you get betterand better you kind of have them to drawupon and you can go oh I know how to dothat I've done it before oh I know howto do that I've done it before and andthat aspect of programming is just thereason that I really really like it youknow as time goes onyou build things up in your tool belt sothe first thing that I want to add is aline this is how you draw a line inJavaScript there's a little bit ofsetting out that I've missed getting thecontext but you essentially have twoaspects a stop position and X&Y andposition X&Y and a stroke and I'mshowing a little bit of code in thistalk but not really that much andnothing really too complex and thereason for that is really this is justJavaScript example but there's so manyways to draw a line on a piece of paperand if we get all tangled up in thatit's like what are we even doing here sohere's a canvas and here's a line onthere I've drawn it left to right Icould draw that from the diagonal sideto the diagonal side is this generativeart I don't know it's more like a lineon the page so let's just introduce alittle aspect of random math dot randomreturns a number between around about greater than half and then we'll havetwo splits here we'll draw it maybe fromleft to right on one side and from rightto left on the other side so here againis our line and when I click it's kindof randomly going from from left toright is that generative out yet no it'sstill just kind of a line on the page solet's introduce some more techniques andtiling is the first one and as we kindof keep introducing these they're justgoing to kind of compound and compoundand compound them on each other sohere's our line on the page put it in anart gallery what happens if we do itfour times and it's just randomly goneinto an X here but it's kind of yeahleft right left right what happens if wedo it more than four times what happenswe do it more than that what times if wedo it more than that what happens if wedo it more than that this is generativeart this is something now that is goingto be different every single time thatyou refresh the page and to me thislooks great this is a kind of oh I'vemade something here in a sense it'sfinished I've got a finished work I'vegot a finished piece of some code that Imade that I'm gonna be able to draw onin the past and I'm just drawing linesand tiling right you can do it with avertical and horizontal lines and againwe're gonna get a totally differentcreation here but again it kind ofprovides this weird like mathematicalbeauty that I that I reallyenjoy so let's start adding some moretechniques to our tool belt displacementis the second one so say we had thesehorizontal lines on the page and eachhorizontal line was a connection ofpoints and we're kind of drawing thelines through those points so whathappens if we start displacing thosepoints what if we move their x and ycoordinates around into into a jumbleand we'll take away the dots just togive the example so we have some kind ofmessed up lines on a page but in a sensethat is generative odd in a simple waybut we can start to add kind of logic tothese things and play with them we canget more complex what if we saidalthough all the lines to the furthestleft and to the furthest bottom willstart to distort more this is kind oflike a generative art piece you've usedyour brain you've kind of used some somesimilar techniques but again we're justdrawing lines on the page we can getmore and more complex with somethinglike this and it's a beauty and againit's something I'm just going to keepsaying and over and over again I reallylove this kind of stuff I reallyappreciate itthis is kind of a mimic of an end asHough I put a lot of a lot of referencesto a lot of generate about us and Iinclude them all in the end so here wehave three things and all we're reallydoing is lines displacement and tilingso what happens you know what we've gota line what is the next most complexthing naturally it's a curve so whathappens if we add curves in JavaScriptto a curve it's almost exactly the sameyou have a start and you have an endposition and then you have two controlpoints and those are used to affect thecurve I actually felt this was reallyfun to play with so I thought I'd makean example that the top right there orthe top left for everybody and the otherside of the start and end point and thenthe two other things are the othercontrol points and you can kind of watchas that center line would draw the curvein and and and this is cool because thisis how Bezier curves work it's like whoayou know you can see the theinterpolation between between each ofthe parts which I find super cool andit's like oh man let's just add points to this whoa fun-fun-funit's like oh there's those fuzzy curvescrazy rightso if we add curves to our page and wego ah let's look back at our tilingtechnique and we tile and we Thailand wetile and we tile you don't even knowthat that's what you're gonna get youdon't expect that coming through butagain it's gonna be differenttime it's a nice little piece of artit's a nice little piece of code it's anice little rap you know so we can addcurves to our and as half example andwe're starting to get something havedeveloped a little bit more here and ofcourse you could put the put thedisplacement in the middle and you couldget something like that Joy Divisionlogo and it's going to be differentevery single time so let's add somethingelse to our page to about repetition andrepetition in development is pretty muchloops right so let's have a play withthose what if we draw our displace lineright across the page and what if wedisplace it and draw it again but wedon't erase the previous version andagain and again and again and again andagain and again and again and again westart to get some kind of patternsemerging right what happens if we do itthousands of times we get this kind ofweird natural kind of Harry Harrycreation and you don't really expectthis again it's kind of a little bit ofsurprise and delight in your own codeand every single time that you do thisyou're going to get something differenta different creation and it's alwaysgoing to be cool it's always going to bedifferent and that's repetition again wecan put that in our and as often nowwe've got some really complex stuffgoing on here and again it's justbeautiful beautiful little creation sonow we've got eight things that we'vemade with with our with our techniquesand you can kind of see what's happeninghere and how it's kind of compounding onitself so shapes let's add shapes we'vegot lines curves naturally the nextthing is shapes and again in JavaScriptthere's rect and arced so you can dorectangles and squares and arcs orcircles but really you can draw anyshape you just have to move to eachcoordinate of the shape and then saystroke at the end so if we introduce ourtiling example before and we kind of usea series of squares and triangles andcircles and stuff like that we're gonnaget again super complex pieces I guessyou can kind of keep going deeper andyou're gonna get this kind of noiseeffect we can get these squares and wecan start to apply our displacement inour random variables so what happens ifwe kind of randomly rotate squares thatare that are more towards the bottomthis is a again an example from something like that and what happens ifwe displace those we've got this nicelittle piece of odd here it can be assimple or it can be as complex as wewant but again it'skind of code complete you've gotsomething you've created something wecan play with a suckle and we can do ourdisplacement again so there's our dotsand we can start to kind of mangle thecircle around that's what it looks likeand again we can just do it over andover and over and over again and we'regonna get this crazy like ring esquething form and it's just so much fun tomake this stuff it's so much it adds somuch joy to the code because you againyou're gonna get something differentevery single time and it's gonna lookbeautiful over and over and over againso let's add recursion to our tool beltwe all know recursion from codinginterviews and that's pretty much itbut for those who don't know in inrecursion you're calling a functionwithin itself and then you kind of havean edge case which is there where it'slike oh let's break out of the break outof the recursion so in this example I'mdrawing a rectangle and then inside thatrect Kong ago I'm gonna draw another oneuntil it gets smaller and smaller andsmaller until it reaches a certain sizeand then we can start adding in ourrandom variables again it can be it canbe less complex it can be more complexwe could tilt it in different directionsright and then we can go back to ourtool belt and say Oh what do we know howto do oh we have tiling right so let'stile that a bunch of times let's titleit a ton of times and again whoasomething done something really reallynice you can kind of print it out youcan get these AXI drills which will drawit on a page they're beautiful creationsthis again is something from the earlydays of computer art we can get atriangle and we can recurse in that soif we draw three triangles and then goanother lady and another lady this isthe Pinsky's triangle which is a kind ofcommon occurrence in in recursion andthen we can add our displacement fromour tool belt we can start messing itaround drawing it again and again andagain we can draw it a ton of timeswe're gonna have again these sameeffects these same little developmentsjust kind of going on and on and on andon this is another one branching whichyou wish you kind of see so it splitsinto two branches and they go in arandom direction for branches and itgets more and more complex as you go onand then we could use our tiling maybewe could tile them around in a circlereally complex with that and we're goingto have this kind of scaryMordor eye thing going onso now look at what we've got like it'sjust growing and growing and growingit's so exciting and it's so fun to justmake this stuff let's add colors to roh my god how do we go this far withoutadding colors let's kind of dip intocolors a little bitDeanna kind of talked about these thingsin in her talk in the earlier daysgetting random colors is kind ofdifficult you would guess oh we got anour G and a B so let's just kind ofrandomize those numbers but you kind ofnoticed that we get some of these Genkicolors randomizing andcomputer-generated colors is reallyreally difficult I think that a lot ofgenerative artists do is they stick tothe HSL space so they can pick asaturation and a lightness and then youcan rotate through the hue and at leastthis way you kind of get similar colorsand it works well for gradients butagain the reality of it is that pickingcolors is super complex and there's allthese kind of techniques that people usebut even then it's not really perfect tothe eye so a good trick is really tojust go on a website like Adobe colorsor color levers comb and just find somenice palettes that people have kind ofput together that you know gonna looknice and so we can start adding colorsinto our examples what if we add it intoour shapes like look at that it'scompletely different from the black andwhite version it's completely completelynice this is an example that I took froma website rectangle world we're drawingcurved lines which are our pipes and wecan kind of get the more and morecomplex and they kind of interweave witheach other but when we add color westart to get these really nice littlecreations and you can add like kind ofrandom colors like this and a palette oryou could do something like this whichis just like one straight red line youstart to add the colors and you start toget more complexity and more enjoymentand you can create yeah here's using our circle and we're justkind of tiling it across the screenusing repetition over and over and yousee it starts to create these kind ofsilky these silky effects and we can adddifferent colors and we can adddifferent shapes and I don't know it'sjust the evolution of it and the beautyof it it's very kind of screen saveresque of course as well you see thingslike that in screen savers we can gowith our recursion so here's an examplewhere I'm drawing a circle in a circleand a circle in a circle what happens ifwe draw two circles we start to get thiskind of crazy shape if we drawthree funnily enough the Pinsky'striangle pops up again but you can seethe kind of complexity evolving in thisand that really all we're doing isdrawing a circle if we draw four if wedraw five like wow you would neverexpect something like that to pop outsix it starts to you start to lose a bitof definition around there but what ifwe had colors into that and we usedifferent shades of green again it'slike oh you start to get these crazykind of fractally patterns and you canyou know add a the generative aspect andkind of be random with with variablesand what you get out of things like thatsuper beautiful algorithms I'm and we'restarting to get a little bit morecomplex here we all know that algorithmsare the world programs use when theydon't want to explain what they did andthat's exactly what I'm gonna do soPerlin noise is one that pops up a lot Itook this one from code pen I mean areference at the end and a purlin noiseyou create a field of vectors andthey're pointing in each direction andthen you shoot something through thosevectors and they're influenced by theworld around them Poland noise wasactually created for for animation tomimic kind of real life examples andwhen you put a pearl in noise and youput a ton of particles you start to getthese really really beautifulcollections creations and it's all it'sall generative on every single time thatyou refresh it you're gonna getsomething new you're gonna get somethingdifferentyou can run them slow you can run themfast a lot of people kind of pause thesebecause yeah they have an innate beautyin their own put them in Asarco theylook really nice printed on shirts andthings like that it's the kind of thingthat looks really really nice when youstart to add color to it and you seethis kind of slowly slowly evolved movemy mouse out of the way yeah thecomplexity is just kind of hidden inthis red one might be a little bit morea little bit more visible it's got thiskind of wood s grain effect and youcould run it longer you can run itshorter you know it's totally up to youthat's the fun so we can start to addother inputs into this for example if wetook the Mona Lisa and we said let'sdraw a grid across the screen and getthe colors out of each of those spotsand then draw a circle we're gonna getthis nice kind of minimal Mona Lisaisn't that niceyou could use recursion into that andgeorgianayou're gonna get a different arty styleevery time you refresh it's gonna bedifferent you can turn it into Legoblocks if you want and it still has abeautiful style a beautiful feel it'ssomething that I feel proud to have madeyou can add audio inputs and you knowsend a message to somebody and save thatout and go hey we've got we've got somemore generative art here so now look ateverything we've made and you can justsee how these simple techniques thelines the circles they they compound onthemselves and this is really just thetip of the iceberg for generative art itjust goes on and on and on like thisthere's so much to do and so much to addthere's a there's so much music that goes on thathas kind of generative aspects to ityeah it just is a super super expensivebeautiful space so I want to getretrospective for a little bit now thatI've kind of gone through thistechniques and look at what I wasdiscovering when I was doing this andI'm running a workshop tomorrow atdecompress to create generative art withpeople and it just gave me a nice lookinto again the tool belt and the ideathat when we're building things we havesmall pieces like drawing a line and wecan put a line and a loop together andwe can create something infinitelycomplex but you could also kind of do iton pen and paper so I wanted to look atthe ways that we learn of course we usethings like tutorials we use things likeStack Overflow we use things like ducksand these are great they're they'rereally good at providing a small pieceof information that we can use and a lotof the time I find when when beginnersespecially are looking at problems it'seasy to get a little bit confused withwhat they're trying to do and what isthe actual problem at hand we havethings like code pen jsbin jsfiddleglitch is one of the new ones that thatprovide us with a way to give examplesto each other and and through theseexamples we can kind of add it throughand see what people have done we haveawesome thingsSuz here does twitch streaming of livecoding there's websites like the codingtrain and clever program at that arebuilt to show new people new things butagain I guess the way that we look atlearning and the way that weat developing I was I was kind of hopingto make something a little bit differentso I started playing around with thisidea or something that I've calledtutorial mock down and I'm usinggenerative odd as the examples but herewe've got a tutorial that you would seein a kind of regular everyday site we'vegot an iframe and we've got a small kindof code section at the top and what Iwanted to do is is create thisexperience that lets you go at your ownpace but through the kind of medium oftutorial I'm not like a video where youhave to pull it and go back so as youscroll through this you're going tostart to see the code kind of ridingitself into the bottom into the top leftand it's executing in the bottom rightso oh we're going to stop by drawing aline in the tutorial we're going toexplain how a line works we're gonna adda generative aspect down here so itcould be random every single time likeoh if you don't understand this you cankind of go back to the the single lineand then we're going to start to addmore complexity and start drawing andkind of go in and out and say oh youknow I want to I want to go back I wantto play with this you can kind of playwith it so this is something that I'vekind of been working on and the thestyle that I'm doing it is fairly simpleit's it's a markdown option have usedthe dock on the screen it's just regularmarkdown and a few commands so tutorialmarkdown set up HTML tutorial markdownset up styles and then when you're whenyou're just writing the code again thesame thing just like a tutorial markdowntrigger and as we'll kind of go throughthis will generate into your markdownand create these interactive tutorials Idon't have anything to release just yetbut kind of keep an eye on that spaceand if you're interested even remotelyin working on something like this withme definitely give me a bellthere's my Twitter thank you very muchyouyou
