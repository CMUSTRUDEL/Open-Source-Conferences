Description: 
	So much is expected of our designers and developers. They need to know myriad programming languages and other technical competencies, they must keep abreast of emerging trends and; contribute to the broader community through meetups and online peer learning platforms. 

Often, our designers and developers also work in non-hierarchical organisations, multidisciplinary teams or as freelancers. With organisations like Spotify, Valve & Culture Amp we’re feeling inspired to organise differently, to 'swarm' as fit for purpose teams; to collaborate and lead from anywhere despite role or rank. 

But this scenario is not without its challenges. A couple of years ago, the Inspire9 team started to hear some grumbling from the community. Things like "My colleague won’t listen to me. I have this great idea and we’re supposed to collaborate, but he just does whatever he wants" and "I don’t know what to do when there is conflict, I just freeze". 

They noticed that while their community was technically brilliant, they were struggling with some of the 'human dynamics' of their work. They decided to do something about it and invited me in to run a leadership program "Leading in Networks" with the community which I'll share about in my presentation. 

A very practical talk, full of the tools and tricks I shared with the I9 community. Hear about the insights we gained through our leadership journey, and what changed for participants as they attained deeper insights into their approach and practice as collaborators in multidisciplinary team environments. Hear about the tools and tricks they found most useful and take away your own insights to grow your collaborative practice.
