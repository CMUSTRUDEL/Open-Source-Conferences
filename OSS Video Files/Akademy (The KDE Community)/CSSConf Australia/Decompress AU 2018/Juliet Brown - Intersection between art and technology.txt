Description: 
	Programmers are artists. I am a web animator, developer, and artist. I come from A Fine Arts background, and a question I often get asked is how and why did you become a developer if you come from an arts background? For me, programming is creative, and I would like to share my journey with you. How I brought my diverse background to the developer community and what I am doing with that now. How I relate to technology with its subject matter, medium, and process. Using coding as an artistic medium references and also pushes the boundaries of what art is and can do. Painting and drawing come with such a historical background. 

By bringing the old medium into technology - a new medium, a tool that we as people are involved with day to day excites me, it brings new possibilities for css and javascript and the technology space. 

Common themes I explore in my art practice is popular culture, and the real and the imaginary. Recently, I have been working at converting my practice (painting, drawings) into a large human sized 3D animation world. 

By combing Art and technology together, challenges the notions of the digital world and also how we perceive art and the 'artist'
