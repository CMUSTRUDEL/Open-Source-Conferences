Description: 
	Do you need help convincing your team or wider company they’d benefit from creating a living style guide and UI component library? Or getting buy in on why the one you’ve started is a good idea? Let’s run through a fun analogy comparing how having a design system and building a front-end component library is like the essential afternoon preparation session in a high performing kitchen known as ‘Mise en place’. You’ll learn how to explain how having this in place seperates the amatures from the professionals in kitchens around the world, and will ensure that by the time users walk in the virtual door, the dev kitchen is operating at high speed with grace, and no one’s left waiting, grumpily staring down the wait-staff with their best evil-eyes. 

This talk will benefit you regardless of what level you're at. You’ll come away with a new way to explain to your technical and non-technical stakeholders why you and your team should be given the go ahead to support the successful fast paced delivery of features and products for your users. Don’t sit back and say ‘I told you so’ when things slow to crawl and you're all tangled in legacy code and specifity wars with your heavy CSS. Instead, come and learn a new way to frame the argument to ensure you’ve given everyone the best chance to realise what you already know to be true, before it’s too late.
