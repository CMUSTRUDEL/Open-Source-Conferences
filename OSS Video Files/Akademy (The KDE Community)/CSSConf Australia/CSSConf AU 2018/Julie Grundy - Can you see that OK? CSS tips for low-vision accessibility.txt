Description: 
	So much accessibility advice is based on the needs of screenreader users - but there are many more people with other types of vision problems who've never used a screenreader program in their life. Heck, at 9% of the Australian population, there are more people with vision impairments visiting your site than Internet Explorer users. What tools and techniques are they using, and how will that affect your design?

I’ll show you the effects of different assistive tools for low-vision on a sample site, including text resizing and high-contrast themes. You’ll learn a range of simple yet effective CSS techniques to help your sites cope with those effects, such as proportional units and transparent borders. These techniques can be used by front-enders with CSS skills ranging from beginner to expert. After this talk you’ll be confident in your ability to make any good visual design more user-friendly for people using vision-support tools.
