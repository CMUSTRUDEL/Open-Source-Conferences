Title: Theresa Ma - Effective design and engineering collaboration
Publication date: 2018-04-10
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	Hey designers, have you ever passed off a design to an engineer, only to later find out something unexpected? Maybe the design needs to be re-done because of technical tradeoffs? Maybe something different has been built? Maybe it’s lacking overall polish (why isn’t that button 3px to the left?)?

Hey engineers, have you ever received a mockup from a designer, and had a bunch of questions about it? Maybe it didn’t consider edge cases? Maybe the components in the mockup look different from the components in your pre-built design system? Maybe you’re not sure whether it has to be pixel perfect?

Communication is hard. Collaboration is hard. Strong relationships between design and engineering teams are the foundation for building a strong product. This talk will cover strategies for more effective interdisciplinary communication. This is a talk for both engineers and designers, showing a little bit of each other’s world to foster empathy and understanding for the other discipline while providing practical considerations for day to day communication challenges.
