Title: Theresa Ma - Effective design and engineering collaboration
Publication date: 2018-04-10
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	Hey designers, have you ever passed off a design to an engineer, only to later find out something unexpected? Maybe the design needs to be re-done because of technical tradeoffs? Maybe something different has been built? Maybe it’s lacking overall polish (why isn’t that button 3px to the left?)?

Hey engineers, have you ever received a mockup from a designer, and had a bunch of questions about it? Maybe it didn’t consider edge cases? Maybe the components in the mockup look different from the components in your pre-built design system? Maybe you’re not sure whether it has to be pixel perfect?

Communication is hard. Collaboration is hard. Strong relationships between design and engineering teams are the foundation for building a strong product. This talk will cover strategies for more effective interdisciplinary communication. This is a talk for both engineers and designers, showing a little bit of each other’s world to foster empathy and understanding for the other discipline while providing practical considerations for day to day communication challenges.

all right hi everyone um let's get

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:21,259
started so let's start with a question

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:24,070
why are we here that's kind of a big

00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:26,720
question depending on how you look at it

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,490
like are we why are you here at this

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,470
talk hopefully to get some better

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,080
insight into how to better designer

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,590
engineering collaboration we're here at

00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,720
this conference to celebrate CSS but I

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,010
think if we ask a bigger why're we here

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,340
question there are some important

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,350
lessons we can learn like why are we as

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,110
humans and humans of a particular

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,399
species here I think there are some

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,379
important lessons to learn from our

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,140
human history that we can apply to our

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,100
day to day goals of effective

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,520
interdisciplinary collaboration in the

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,500
workplace so I'm Theresa I'm a software

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,600
engineer at Yelp I have a background in

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,089
computer science cognitive science and

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,100
philosophy so I love the whys of

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,720
questions as much as the house and I

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,280
love bridging different disciplines

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,050
seeing how they tackle the same

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,300
questions from different perspectives

00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,800
and bringing them together and by the

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,869
end I hope that's something that you'll

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,759
also be excited about I hope you'll all

00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,840
have a better understanding and a little

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,849
more empathy for each other's

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,800
disciplines and also armed with a few

00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,860
practical considerations for the

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,030
day-to-day challenges of collaboration

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,770
so I'll be telling you a three-part

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,200
story about what we can learn from our

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,450
history and how that which made us

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,190
humans in general successful in the long

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,539
fight for existence in the world is the

00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,149
same that's going to make us individuals

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:44,119
here in this room successful in our

00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:46,160
collaborations in the workplace so let's

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,530
start with the observation of we are

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,599
everywhere we settled so rapidly in so

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,239
many distinct and ecologically different

00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,390
habitats it's really extraordinary now

00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,399
we're on every continent but why why do

00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,869
we survive but not our human customs

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,869
like the physically stronger

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,940
Neanderthals well it turns out that the

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,950
most likely answer is the same thing

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,849
that makes the debate even possible we

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,870
conquered the world

00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:13,310
thanks above all to our unique language

00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,260
so for anyone who hasn't read safety in

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,709
the brief history of humankind spoiler

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,540
alert

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,700
here's the TLDR briefest history of

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,700
humankind which is that through language

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,709
were able to form shared beliefs that

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,140
enable us to cooperate with stray

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,060
in order to create and use tools that

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,609
help us make those shared beliefs and

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,420
goals of reality which creates community

00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:37,099
and culture so for example my co-workers

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,230
and I we share a common belief and Yelp

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,030
as a company and we work together on the

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,459
shared goal of driving forward yelps

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,920
mission which is to connect people with

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,889
great local businesses we were founded

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,250
in 2004 and in the past 14 years we've

00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:54,230
grown a lot so with all these users and

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,180
reviews around the whole world that

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,769
means that there are a lot of different

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,590
people working in different disciplines

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:02,329
working on our apps and as you can

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,189
imagine it becomes more more difficult

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,590
to keep track of all the design and

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:09,169
engineering decisions being made but

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,549
wherever a user is using Yelp the app we

00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:12,799
wanted to make sure it looks like Yelp

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,780
the brand because for us and for most of

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,060
you as well we want to provide the best

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,040
possible product for our users and one

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,139
of the ways we do that is by building

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,790
strong relationships between our design

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,109
and engineering teams because strong

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,849
relationships between design and

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,549
engineering is the foundation for

00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:30,019
building a strong product but before we

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,849
even get to speaking to each other on a

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,650
technical level about design and

00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,870
engineering topics we need to start with

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,400
our natural language I'm gonna spend a

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,260
fair bit of time covering this language

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,939
portion because that's really what we

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,159
use to communicate with one another and

00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,720
maybe that seems kind of obvious but

00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,609
sometimes it's really these obvious

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,699
realities that make the largest impact

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:51,109
and are the most important to talk about

00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,400
so let's start with what's so important

00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,590
about our human language what's so

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,349
special we aren't the only ones in this

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,569
world with language but what's truly

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,459
unique about ours is that that sets us

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,349
apart isn't that we can talk about

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:06,169
things that are relevant for immediate

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:08,419
survival like where people and lions and

00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:09,859
food and shelter are but rather it's

00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,560
that we can talk about things that don't

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,750
exist at all so as far as we know we're

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,000
the only ones who can talk about entire

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,310
kinds of entities that we've never seen

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,370
or touched or smelled we can speak about

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,099
fictions so our natural language enables

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,259
us not merely to imagine things but we

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:29,060
can imagine them collectively we can

00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:31,009
create concepts like corporations and

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,539
countries and myths and ethics and all

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:35,000
of these beliefs really bind us together

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,210
so we don't just use our language to

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,009
describe the world as that

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,229
but we use it to describe the world as

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,880
we want it to be and we can weave these

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,039
common myths that give us the

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,289
unprecedented ability to cooperate in

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,389
extremely flexible ways with countless

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,530
numbers of strangers and that's really

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,289
what's amazing about our natural

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,180
language so if you're thinking about all

00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,710
this human nature anthropology stuff is

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,479
a little bit too far removed to be

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,509
applicable to the day-to-day realities

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,039
of 2018 modern office work let's talk a

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,139
bit more concretely about what our

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,509
language tells us of our own work

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,160
relationships so the authors of tribal

00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,009
leadership they conducted a ten-year

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,110
field study of 24,000 people in two

00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,000
dozen organizations and they found that

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,220
every organization really acts as a

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,530
small set of tribes as they call it as

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,449
the basic building block of any large

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,490
human effort where they use the word

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,110
tribe I'm gonna use the word circle so

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,139
your workplaces are made up of these

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,789
circles of 20 to 150 people and this is

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,169
something we know even if we're not

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,180
aware of it these are the people that

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,849
you would say hi to if you were walking

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,830
down the street and so every workplace

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,349
is made up of these circles but some are

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,510
far more effective than others so the

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:44,010
authors define five stages of cultures

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,990
with each stage describing the

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,669
effectiveness of the circle and what

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,650
they found from their research is that

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,960
we can determine the stage of a circle

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,760
by the type of language that individuals

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,280
in the circle use and we can actually

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,870
predict the performance of a circle by

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Counting the number of people who speak

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,280
the language at each stage so in this

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
chart they interviewed over a thousand

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,460
people in six companies and then look

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,860
for words that are said in close

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,720
proximity to other words so you can see

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,449
the theme of what dialogue at each stage

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,280
is about and it isn't until Stage four

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,110
where we see effective collaboration

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,630
happening it's where people collaborate

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,570
and work together propelled by a noble

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,300
cause based on their values and so over

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,820
time the language that a person an

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,949
individual speaks and that of the circle

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,440
stage sync up so that the way that we

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,180
can move our circles performance forward

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,039
to the next level where we can

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,840
effectively collaborate with one another

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,419
is actually by moving many people

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,190
forward individually by facilitating

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,750
them to use a different language which

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,820
then actually shifts their behavior

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,770
accordingly so we want to build these

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,430
kinds of stable stage 4 cultures and our

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,000
own workplaces in a way that encompasses

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,680
designers and engineers and in order to

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,120
do that it's not only saying the words

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,639
of that stage that matter but it's also

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,350
how we say it and the context in which

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,570
we say it because words are really about

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,320
how we use them because we speak

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,180
differently under different

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,009
circumstances and I think that's

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,539
something we intuitively know even

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,789
without thinking about it I think about

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,350
the way you speak you change your

00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,660
vocabulary your usage your grammar

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,250
depending on who you're speaking to we

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,770
communicate one way with our peers and

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,960
another with our parents or children or

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,430
hockey coaches like my friends tell me

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,139
that when I speak English to my Chinese

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,729
parents my English takes on a Chinese

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,010
accent so we make all of these

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,020
dialectical adjustments below the level

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,330
of conscious awareness and that means

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,760
that we need to be wary of using the

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,380
word designer engineer that we don't use

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,280
them with some connotation of them being

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,470
the other

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,539
if you're an engineer amongst engineers

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,889
you might say something like design just

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,810
wants this because it looks nice I don't

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,310
know how complicated it is or if you're

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,990
a designer amongst designers you might

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,750
complain about the lack of polish from

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,949
engineering like Oh design engineers

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,960
just don't care about these visual

00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,940
details but every time we say something

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,710
like that when we think of someone as

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,590
the other we're slowly eroding our

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,630
collaborative culture so it's on the

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,130
action item for all of you go out and

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,680
get a coffee with a designer engineer

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,880
that you don't yet work closely with

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,800
that'll also help you better explain

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,510
what you do because it's sometimes it

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,979
can be hard to communicate the things

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,139
that you've learned over the years that

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,849
feel very natural to you when you're so

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,770
immersed in your own discipline but

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:21,979
talking to someone else about it will

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,690
actually help you with that so moving on

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:26,270
from our natural language we can start

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,010
to form a more technical design language

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,020
for our designers and engineers to share

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,089
so a design language is the overall

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,560
visual design of a product and a

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,419
language is a formal system of

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,789
meaningful symbols that allow us to

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,680
communicate with one another so for a

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,000
design language that means having a

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,010
collection of components that are

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,020
defined by principles and patterns with

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:50,270
standard semantic symbols such as colors

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:52,160
type shape spacing icons motion etc for

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,690
everyone to share and understand so

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,810
clear and consistent rules are what

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,100
makes languages successful so for

00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,779
designers and engineers to effectively

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,260
work together they have to be first

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,330
speaking the same design language

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,520
at Yelp we started working on our design

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,170
system over five years ago when we were

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,570
doing a redesign of our business listing

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,370
page our front-end code base was getting

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,960
out of control and the Photoshop back

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,630
when designers are still using Photoshop

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,140
to code workflow just wasn't cutting it

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,080
anymore

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,180
so as the designs of our new business

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,680
listing page started to take shape it

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,660
became clear that we were establishing

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,980
the future of yelps look and feel so we

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,080
started pulling out components that

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,540
could be reused and making a design

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,310
system out of that and now that design

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,010
system surfaces existing solutions for

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,050
designers and engineers but a lot has

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,880
changed over the past five years so a

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,890
few years ago we changed the way their

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,800
engineering teams were organized we

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,170
stuff separate web Android and iOS teams

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,150
so the web team was responsible for

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,260
building out all the web features but

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,790
now we have cross product teams across

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,530
product verticals so teams are all

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,630
working on the same feature for

00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,520
different platforms so we have one team

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,100
that's responsible for our contributions

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,600
like reviews photo uploads and we have

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,810
another team working on reservations

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,700
that you can book a table on Yelp but

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,070
now as designers and engineers focus on

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,260
more discrete areas of the app for their

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,420
particular platform we can start to lose

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,730
track of our larger design system which

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,620
leads to this via this fragmented visual

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,430
language and everyone's speaking their

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,930
own dialect so for example we recently

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,610
did a component audit of our design

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,400
system across platforms and we found

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,260
that our one design language had really

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,810
split off into three different dialects

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,720
what we called an alert on web was a

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,420
message alert box on Android banner

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,360
notification view on iOS and designers

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,710
were calling it a page alert so having a

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,550
shared language is really important to

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,070
us so we've been working on

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,600
consolidating that so get your designers

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,000
engineers to share the same vocabulary

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,330
and from there you can start to define

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,400
the shared goals so as an action item if

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,710
you have a design system audit the

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,630
language write a glossary if you have to

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,760
so designers and engineers might have

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,580
different ideas of what a component is

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,960
or even engineers in different

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,490
disciplines there might be differing

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,950
opinions as to what counts as a

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,450
component and what components are part

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,430
of your standard library so have a

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,880
conversation around that and if you

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,040
don't

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,870
Adonai system yet you can consider start

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,030
to build one there are many great

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,380
resources out there such as the Design

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,780
Systems handbook

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,220
Dhyana Manor is one of the authors on it

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:30,090
thank you for writing it it was it's

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,770
really good okay so now once we have all

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,470
this shared vocabulary what is all this

00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,930
language stuff actually get us well it

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,460
it allows us to express our ideals or

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,830
dreams or goals and to actually

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,870
understand one another so it means that

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,910
we can talk to one another in order to

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,980
cooperate the next step is to actually

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,280
use it to actually use our language and

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,690
talk to one another so I sat down with

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,430
some designers and engineers and Yelp

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,350
and interviewed them about what they

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,670
felt their goals were to see where

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,190
designing engineering goals really

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,980
overlap so this is what designers want

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,810
you to know in a very broad sense the

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,330
goal of every product designer is to be

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,030
able to solve the users problems whether

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,590
that's very small on a UI level like how

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,350
do we highlight a call to action to

00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,940
being very on a very high level like how

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,670
do we get users to come back and be

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,590
engaged so because of that they're

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,480
constantly balancing trade-offs that

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,220
they make on a day to day basis

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,080
they're constantly balancing business

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,420
needs with user needs with engineering

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,100
feasibility so it's easy to criticize

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,450
the design when you're unaware of all

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,580
the trade-offs that they've had to make

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,490
in order to reach that design trade-offs

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,990
for example of sleek versus usable our

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,910
products cover a very large audience

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,950
some people are very tech savvy some

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,920
aren't we have to make accessibility

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,270
considerations so there are a lot of

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,830
trade-offs that designers have had to

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,530
make by the time you see the final

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,620
mock-up and also design is actually far

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,970
less subjective than you may think it is

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,730
decisions aren't made just because it

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,950
looks nice there's usually a reason so

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,480
user behavior is considered like where

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,340
should we place a button if our users

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,200
are left-handed versus as most of them

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,660
are right-handed why should we use a

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,880
button instead of a link and even for

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,400
things like font sizes and colors it's

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,770
not just because it looks nicer it's

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,420
often about visual hierarchy so when a

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,750
user is scanning the page we only have

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,130
their attention for maybe a second and

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,470
so when their eyes land on that page

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,200
what are they most likely to see are as

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,490
eyes naturally fall somewhere so design

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,060
is all about directing that

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,010
tension in engineers designers really do

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,750
care about you and your work they know

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,750
that a pretty MOC that isn't technically

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,890
feasible isn't the right solution and

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,839
designers care about performance as well

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:44,060
because every millisecond that the page

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,800
lands load slower and makes an impact

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,050
and as for what engineers want you to

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,880
know sometimes a change that looks

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,899
simple is actually far more complicated

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,790
than you may think

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,339
because we would all love for our code

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,020
bases to be perfect but often there's

00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,520
code debt that gets in the way of us

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,209
being able to do things as efficiently

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,220
or easily as we'd like so for example

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,709
let's say design wants to increase the

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,350
inset here from 8 pixels to 16 pixels

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,660
our first glance it looks easy you just

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,670
bump up the number but what's actually

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,649
happening is that every single one of

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,200
these elements defines their own inset

00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,940
so that's not a thing that you can do at

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,709
the page level and to change the

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,630
incident means going through every class

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:27,209
and changing that number from 8 to 16

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,160
and also these components aren't just

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,950
used there they're used all across the

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,510
app so we have to consider how to make

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,450
our components both were usable and

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,220
flexible so just because something looks

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,079
like a minor change doesn't mean that it

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,839
is something like this actually ended up

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,860
changing like a hundred files is a real

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,480
case and we know that sometimes it can -

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,579
if you can feel like it takes a very

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,320
long time to do development work then

00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,850
that's because things come up sometimes

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,160
things come up in code reviews sometimes

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,100
were blocked on things by other teams

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,930
touching code that we need and engineers

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,700
also do love visual consistency and

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,010
coaching the citizen see because good

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,800
code can and should enforce consistency

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,180
and really at the end of the day we do

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,980
care a lot about shipping and great

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,600
product to the user we don't want to

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,709
ship bugs and we really do care about

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,750
design so comparing the goals of the

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,040
engineer and the designer the end goal

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,480
really comes down to the same thing

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,790
which is creating the best possible

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,770
product for our users and we have unique

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,250
perspectives on that common goal and

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,709
that's how and why we work together so

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,300
as an action item for all of you take a

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,890
note of what are the shared beliefs and

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,110
goals that unite your designers and

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,670
engineers Oh what are your designer

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,710
engineer

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,300
principals what are your company goals

00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,460
and what's your mission statement but

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,590
most importantly is everyone aware of

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,270
that all those nice mission statements

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,130
and goals they're only effective if

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,270
everyone actually understands and

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,100
believes in them all right so let's get

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,800
to the very practical stuff tips for the

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,000
nitty-gritty day-in day-out

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
communication that actually gets things

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,880
done

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,220
so my team at Yale spent a few quarters

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,320
studying our design workflow how our

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,630
product goes from design ideation to

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,280
mock-ups the handoff to engineers and

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,970
through that development process and

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,320
this is some advice from what we learned

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,000
designers don't be afraid to talk to

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,800
your engineers and ask them for an

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,630
earlier opinion engineers don't be

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,550
afraid to talk to your designers because

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,290
we found that sometimes engineers didn't

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,420
talk to their designers at all during

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,740
the design process an engineer would

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,750
receive a mock-up and then immediately

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,310
start to work on it and then later

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,350
they'd come across some design issues

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,850
like oh this component is slightly

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,830
different than the one we currently have

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,330
in our design system did you need to use

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,910
a green button when all our buttons are

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,220
blue our default Martin is 12 pixels did

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,540
you mean to make this eighteen or two

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,030
engineering teams would simultaneously

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,500
build the same component what they could

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,070
have just put it once in our design

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,230
system

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,880
so sometimes engineers don't even ask

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,350
about those things when they come up but

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,930
they would take the mock-up to be like

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,210
the truth rather noble was in the design

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,980
system so if your engineers aren't

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,930
talking to your designers in the design

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,430
process there will probably be issues

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,410
that come up later that could have been

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:10,100
addressed earlier by simply having a

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:12,200
conversation before development began so

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,120
understand how and when product

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,830
decisions are made in your company take

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,290
a look at that timeline and look at

00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,910
where design an engineering overlap see

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,680
where you can turn that process into

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,060
more of a conversation between designers

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,710
and engineers rather than just a handoff

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,390
and if your design and engineering team

00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,490
sit separately try having them sit

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,650
together designers with the engineers

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,630
who are working on the future because

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,430
don't discount how important those

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,410
casual water-cooler chats really are

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,120
because meetings have too high of an

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,770
overhead for casual exchanges and you

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,390
want to make it as easy as possible for

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,970
designers and engineers to talk to one

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,170
another because yes it's 2018 and we

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,590
have all sorts of ways to communicate

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,720
virtually be at IRC

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,330
hang out slack HipChat facebook for work

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,620
etc but think of your own comfort level

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,600
when you have to ping a stranger that

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,309
you've never spoken to versus the prison

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,840
sitting right next to you so that

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,970
comfort level comes from repeat

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,700
interactions and familiarity with their

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,799
presence some people are more outgoing

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,749
than others they'll say hi to strangers

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,789
in the elevator some people aren't and

00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:14,950
going on off sites is a great way to

00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:16,960
break that ice because remember we want

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,749
to build circles that include both

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,889
designers and engineers so feature teams

00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:22,840
that Yelp has started including

00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:24,580
designers in the off sites and that's

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,320
really helped with team building so now

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,450
designers don't feel like they have more

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,369
allegiance to their design team rather

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,480
than their engineering team they feel

00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:35,679
like they're equally part of both teams

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,999
and consider which design and

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,549
engineering decisions need to be made

00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:41,289
earlier on and the only way you're going

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,379
to know that is by asking the designer

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:46,299
engineer because as we already saw some

00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:48,429
seemingly small design changes can cause

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:50,080
large or engineering changes so have a

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,999
conversation around feasibility while

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,059
the design is still in the exploratory

00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:57,279
stage but when we started carving out

00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,200
time in our product design development

00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,539
timeline for that for designers to share

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,860
their work earlier with engineers we

00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:04,149
actually found that sometimes engineers

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,669
didn't really know what kind of feedback

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:08,950
to give or what - specifically watch out

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,769
for so we created a checklist for them

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,529
that covers things like for each mock-up

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:16,059
of which components is comprised what

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,519
will it look like on different screen

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,039
sizes are there any error states are

00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,629
there edge cases mobile interactions

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,289
look like what happens when a user does

00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:28,809
X is a cop guns page finalized or the

00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,639
assets such as icon the illustrations

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:32,350
available will will this look like in

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:34,899
another language if the strings are much

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,970
longer so these checklists are a great

00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:38,769
way for coping with the limits of human

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:43,419
attention and memory and it's an

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:45,429
accessible tool for everyone to use Moby

00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,169
on checklists we can also create more

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,019
sophisticated tools that actually bridge

00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:52,090
design and engineering because

00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:54,129
communication isn't easy it takes a lot

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,080
of effort to be considerate and kind but

00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:58,029
we can reduce cognitive load wherever we

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,960
can in order to better use that mental

00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:02,900
energy for the tasks that really

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,030
to us so the first evidence for a tool

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,430
production dates back to about two and a

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,780
half million years ago in the

00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,550
manufacture and use of tools is actually

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,010
the criteria by which archaeologists

00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,170
used to recognize ancient humans these

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,830
were things like hammer stones and sharp

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:21,440
stone flake for cutting these tools made

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,910
it easier for us to do things and since

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,440
then we've been able to create tools

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,740
that are a little bit more sophisticated

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,820
and for more specific use cases so for

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,050
example one of the tools that we've

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,180
created is yell pecans

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,370
it's a cross-platform icon build system

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,730
that solved a problem of sharing assets

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,950
a few years ago this is what our icons

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,320
look like they were wildly different we

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,170
had many shades of colors there's no

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,640
singular grid to work off of that's

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,590
where we came from and this is where we

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,450
are now so our designers created this

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,460
beautiful family of icons that work on

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,590
all our different platforms within this

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,450
bounding box so that they're centered

00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,970
wherever they're used and they have like

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,560
details for each pixel density and this

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,270
makes it really easy to swap around

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,310
icons because they all fit within this

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,410
box and we have all these different apps

00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,510
that now use this consistent family of

00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,370
icons so great we have all these

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,530
beautiful icons but how do we actually

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,440
get them to the engineers for them to

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,150
put in our apps as many of you have

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,640
probably experienced it's a little bit

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,440
of a pain to share assets so we use this

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,600
hodgepodge system like oh it's on the

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,670
JIRA tickets no it's in the Dropbox or I

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,830
email that to you but those two weeks

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,710
ago we're not using it the suitcase

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,690
anymore it's a briefcase now so since

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,390
since the elf product is supported on so

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,610
many devices each image has divine icon

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:41,270
size and device-independent pixels so we

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,680
had 2x 3x densities for all of these and

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,900
we really needed a way to automate this

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,060
stuff we needed a system that could

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,040
support the conversion scaling of icons

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,800
and then publish a package that could be

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,590
consumed by our apps so if we created

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,810
our icon system so now once an icon is

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,940
designed the illustrators commit an SVG

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,380
to a repo and then that automatically

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,120
triggers the Jenkins build that

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,010
validates the file and creates the

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,770
variations in the different formats

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,840
needed for web iOS and Android with each

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,060
platform receiving a package of all the

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,340
assets that they need so for developers

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,169
to use those new assets

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,630
it's as easy as bumping the version and

00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:18,610
package.json or requirements text and

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,919
the equivalent for iOS and Android

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,960
so our developers can then easily access

00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,610
those assets through code ensuring that

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,740
no errors are made in that handoff

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,409
process so designers say Yelp have

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,049
stopped exporting icons for over a year

00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,140
now a designer can instead just say oh

00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:38,169
I'm using eighteen by eighteen briefcase

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,820
no more email or JIRA and now developers

00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:42,400
can just use the icons right where they

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,020
need them and a project like this is

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,970
only possible as a collaborative effort

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,330
between designers and engineers of

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,429
different platforms so Yelp cons was an

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,409
example of a tool that helps us do

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,950
things but we can also create tools that

00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:58,929
help us organize and share information

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,789
so even though we started making tools

00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:02,440
at least two and a half million years

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,870
ago we didn't actually figure out how to

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,090
write things down until around 5,000

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,490
years ago but once we did we effectively

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,890
extended the natural limits of human

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,840
history by preserving our memories on

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,210
clay tablets and cave walls and

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,370
eventually on papyrus and parchment and

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,070
Microsoft Word and Google Docs Instagram

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,350
Twitter so these days we have all sorts

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,000
of these tools to help us organize and

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,500
store the information that we write down

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,409
but the purpose is still very much the

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,870
same it's to offload a great deal of the

00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:34,000
processing that our neurons would do to

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,770
an external device that then becomes an

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,690
extension of our own brains turning us

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,220
into cyborgs and allowing us to keep

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,860
track of details that we can't trust

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,570
ourselves to remember so by writing

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,149
things down we make knowledge available

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,490
for future us to refer to and we're

00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:50,110
better able to share that knowledge

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,179
among the community across teams and

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,309
disciplines and you probably already use

00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,230
multiple tools for this you probably

00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,789
have some sort of tool for sharing

00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,919
things like mock-ups and code and

00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,779
tracking issues and comments but

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,090
whatever tools your team use make sure

00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:06,279
everyone has access if design is using

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,260
tool X for design reviews and

00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,270
engineering is using tool Y for code

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,190
reviews make sure that your engineers

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,610
have access to to Lex and your designers

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,740
have access to tool Y and you also want

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,870
one way of tracking design and

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,480
implementation issues like will they be

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,710
tracked in envision as the JIRA ticket

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,840
as a spreadsheet whatever it is and make

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,850
that everyone knows what it is because

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,120
each company is different so find out

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,980
what works for you and also engineers

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,110
probably have some sort of development

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,059
playground within which they make their

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,520
changes and maybe another staging area

00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:42,169
before changes go out to production so

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,970
if that's the case make sure to share

00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:45,770
that development playground with design

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,299
when the work is still in progress you

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,929
can catch a lot of the issues before

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:52,340
they actually go out and all these tools

00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,200
they take the information that we

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,480
already have tucked away inside our

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,500
heads or our own work and it makes them

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,730
accessible for everyone else as well and

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,649
beyond that we could also create tools

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,299
to reinforce our shared design language

00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:08,299
to bridge that gap between the

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:10,309
disciplines so we have our design system

00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:13,039
and we expect it to be this single

00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:15,770
source of truth but in reality there's

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,559
really a separate system for design web

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,690
iOS and Android designs components

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,149
aren't sketch files web components are

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,649
in cheetah and react and then iowa's and

00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:27,200
Android yet still have their own native

00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:29,419
components so we started out with this

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,730
great shared design language and then

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,649
slowly over time box people start

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,330
creating their own dialect this is

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:37,580
everywhere in our natural language it's

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,350
like in America someone says can I get

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,320
an orange pop and you're like what's pop

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,179
do you mean soda or here in Australia

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,010
someone be like he'd want to get MacOS

00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,570
for brekkie and then I look all confused

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,360
and they're like oh don't get McDonald's

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,950
for breakfast so it's hard to maintain

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,710
these systems that are separate but

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,080
supposed to be the same any change

00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,370
requires coordination and that means

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,230
what's in design and what's in code

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,090
don't always match and eventually over

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,580
time the design and code components

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,470
drift apart so everyone has a different

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,330
version of what they consider to be the

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,890
truth you'll see that these are just a

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,809
little bit different in these little

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,669
differences and sometimes it's caused a

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,860
sharp-eyed engineer to build out a new

00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:17,870
component just to match the design spec

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,789
entirely so that's what we're trying to

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,890
solve by generating sketch files from

00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:23,720
code there are open source projects out

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,309
there such as react sketch app an HTML

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,289
sketch app that will generate schedules

00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,940
from code at Yelp we don't use react

00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,740
native so for web women working on

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,110
integrating HTML sketch app an HTML

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,730
Sketchup CLI into our design system so

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,529
every time we update a component in code

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,160
it triggers an Jenkins build to generate

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,930
a new sketch file of our design come

00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,660
that then automatically uploads to our

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,130
designers Dropbox meanwhile for iOS and

00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,780
Android there's nothing out there yet so

00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,700
we created our own sketch generators

00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,270
from scratch and this is actually a

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,980
screenshot from our iOS sketch generator

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,480
which we will be up sourcing and maybe

00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,790
the next month so keep your eye out for

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,410
that and tools like this are important

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,750
because they're capable of reinforcing

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,430
our shared language and other benefits

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,050
are also that it's much easier for us to

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,360
automatically spit out a bunch of

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,700
permutations of a component then is for

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,500
a designer to do that for examples these

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,550
are our business passports and these are

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,650
all the different ways that they can

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,600
look under different circumstances so we

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,060
can catch edge cases earlier this way in

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,430
design and we can also generate entire

00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,900
pages of our app and sketch so these are

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,580
real sketch files generated from our app

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,740
so we can see what design changes look

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,240
like across the entire app so now

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,590
designers engineers don't have to go

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,760
back and forth on whether something's

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,770
part of the design language or whether

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
something looks right there's truly a

00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,340
single source of truth now with a shared

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
vocabulary so that when you say

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,780
something like alert button everyone

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,400
knows exactly what you're referring to

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,320
so maintaining consistency is really

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,050
hard but it's necessary if we're to

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,430
effectively collaborate with one another

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,410
so this sketch generator is a tool that

00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,480
reinforces the vocabulary of our shared

00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,940
language which actually takes us back

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,950
full circle so from that single source

00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,440
of truth we can have the shared language

00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,150
with which to communicate about shared

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,100
goals enabling us to collaborate

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,930
effectively and to create even better

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,000
tools for reinforcing our shared

00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,800
language so we started out with our

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,360
language and its ability to describe

00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,100
that which does not yet exist to

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,870
communicate to one other the ideal world

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,370
we want to live in and that enables us

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,650
to work together to form a community

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,990
that strives towards making those goals

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,910
a reality because at the bottom of it

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,650
effective design and engineering

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,570
collaboration is really just corporate

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,310
speak for effective human collaboration

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,000
and we've been learning how to do that

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,610
our whole lives

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,440
even if you don't have the resources to

00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,910
create the tools that you need the

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,380
important part is that we know what it

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,930
means to communicate with respect

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,430
compassion and sensitivity and set aside

00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,280
our differences in order to listen

00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,720
understand

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,669
and just care a little bit better for

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,289
each other and that's what effective

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:47,470
design and engineer and collaboration is

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:49,929
really all about so these slides are

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,940
available at Teresa da ma slash this is

00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:55,330
coffee au PDF if you want to refer to

00:28:51,940 --> 00:29:01,119
any notes and thank you all listening

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,119
