Fonts are part of the critical request chain. If you’re not paying attention to your fonts beyond merely slapping up a Google Fonts link tag, you might be missing some big opportunities to speed things up. Stuff like preloading fonts, using font-display to render fallback text faster, more creative sub-setting choices, and electing to avoid non-essential typefaces specifically for users on limited data plans. If fast is your thing, zip into this session to allay your font fears, and learn to tune up your typefaces for maximum speed!
