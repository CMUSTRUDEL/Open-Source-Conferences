Title: Ivana McConnell - Journeys: What makes a developer, really?
Publication date: 2018-04-10
Playlist: CSSConf AU 2018
Description: 
	As part of Origins, I have been researching the different paths of coders and designers into the tech industry, and the paths are wonderfully varied and unique. However, we continue to raise up and legitimise certain paths over others, implicitly deciding who gets to be a developer of CSS or Javascript. That language then feeds into job postings and wider perceptions of what it is to write CSS, what it is to write Javascript (or even Javascript frameworks), and the legitimacy of different learning paths. From this, we create hierarchies and draw lines which result in different pay scales and fluctuating perceptions of the code we write. This threatens to devalue inclusivity work, and the development community as a whole— let’s learn about the unconventional paths into development and consciously pull away from the damaging hierarchies we create. Let’s celebrate these journeys instead!

hello thank you so much for sticking

00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:17,630
around I hope everybody is suitably

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,770
caffeinated and has a sugar high from

00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,300
those excellent pastries and let's get

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,869
into it

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:29,689
so my name as mentioned Thank You Ivana

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:33,379
I live in work in Vancouver in Canada I

00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,830
was born in Bosnia though raised in

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:36,379
Croatia

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,680
then Canada spent several years in

00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:41,750
Scotland and have a degree in psychology

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,600
and yeah once upon a time did some

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,269
neuroscience research today UX design

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,330
but I've also been or called myself an

00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:53,330
interaction designer a front-end of UI

00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,360
designer and a freelancer and across all

00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,549
of these I hope to build web experiences

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,949
right and CSS was always involved in

00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:04,430
them and the reason I'm telling you all

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:08,689
this is because as a result of all of it

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,640
I care a lot about you know due to all

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:14,570
this change both geographically and

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,330
semantically about how we build and

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,730
reinforce human bonds on the web how we

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,280
value each other and how our complexity

00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,710
is human beings effects and is affected

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,390
by software

00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,110
so now that I've rambled at you a little

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,510
bit about me I sort of turned this

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,790
question back to you and the next time

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,140
that you're asked but take a second

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,900
maybe to think about your answer right

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,810
it's never enough to just say I'm a

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,380
developer or even I'm a web developer

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,630
right

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,070
we contextualise our work with the

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,850
technologies and languages that we work

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,970
with but there's no agreed-upon standard

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,260
really right like software developer or

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,850
an engineer alone doesn't tell you much

00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,270
about what someone builds what they use

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,430
to build it or the skills that they have

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,950
but those words have connotations not

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,409
just about what that person does but how

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,959
they got there and we all see these

00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:16,129
things as Teresa just showed a little

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:18,140
bit differently and sure I allow that

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,459
sometimes it's just easier to simplify

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,110
things right if you don't always need to

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,920
care about the details of someone else's

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,060
work or how they got to her

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,490
you know where they're standing but

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,800
there are places where these shortcuts

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,840
that we take a harmful in the words that

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,580
we use are important right because they

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,739
carry value and assumptions along with

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,310
them and how we talk about our work

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,170
about CSS about how we learned web

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,080
development all of that matters and

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,239
that's what I want to talk about the

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,150
overarching point is that there's no

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,819
concrete line as the the talks are

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,230
showed today between you know what's

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,530
design what's development what's

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,530
technical what isn't and if there is it

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,750
doesn't exist universally Brad Frost

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,769
called this the development identity

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,890
crisis making great things today

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,709
requires flexibility collaboration and

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,190
respect of each other skills and not a

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:17,970
universal capital D decision on what is

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,530
it isn't development and to sort of

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,700
illustrate that let's kind of rewind a

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,760
little bit because at first CSS was very

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,769
much in the this is appearance bucket

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,769
right visuals were one thing codes

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,510
another and everything is very easy and

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,940
then this happens huh

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,890
right again Tracy just spoke about

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,130
collaboration and how complicated it can

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,829
be it's fascinating because the lines

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,660
between disciplines have blurred so much

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,090
these days that we don't even know what

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,070
makes design what makes development and

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,220
this is because the web is no longer

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,049
just a screen we don't build websites as

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,400
I mentioned we build experiences that

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:03,030
reach across devices across cultures

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,410
contexts abilities services and I'd

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,459
argue that a universal definition is

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,459
likely a waste of time

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,900
so as the web grows right so do our

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,120
roles and our skills and we can

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,280
generalize or specialize or we could

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,859
focus on CSS as a whole or we can focus

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,150
on just one tiny aspect of it and I

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,370
think this is really cool right we've

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,440
spent all of today don't talking about

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,539
this we can really dig into the minutiae

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,479
of things and devote time to really

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:34,169
really understanding them and yet we

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,120
still hang on to this even if implicitly

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,430
right

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,310
this isn't sure anymore all right

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,070
there's no neat line to be drawn anymore

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,120
it used to be that HTML and CSS was just

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,920
about presentation

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,130
whereas programming and quote unquote

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,370
development described function and that

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,780
was convenient but isn't the case and

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,880
David said this earlier today and I love

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,810
it because it's true this it's it's

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,130
magical what we can do today and I do

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,490
have a couple of examples like we've

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:08,570
seen examples all day right but I just

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,630
want to show all of this because right

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,720
we have transforms and complex selectors

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,530
and pseudo elements methodologies like

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,320
object-oriented CSS grid right these are

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,970
all concepts that require a developer

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,820
approach to implement new use

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,470
meaningfully right because like have you

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,790
ever looked at some of the documentation

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,190
like taking a step back and look at it

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,900
looked at it for certain frameworks like

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,490
oh yeah just fire up the terminal and

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,590
install these dependencies and do this

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,180
and be that it's not just about

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,780
including a stylesheet anymore because

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,310
imagine being a beginner looking at that

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,430
and you know people might just say you

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,320
know it's just CSS but CSS touches every

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,530
aspect of the web today and it's a key

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,600
development skill right so here's a few

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,640
more of these right so again as design

00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,140
systems grow in popularity so does the

00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,000
capability of CSS so yeah we saw this

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,620
for github design system and Brenda

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,310
earlier showed a responsive design in

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,440
four lines of CSS this framework was

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,020
made by a friend of mine it's a

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,030
collection of modules self-contained in

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,510
a way that draws from JavaScript and

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,490
Ruby dependencies are managed imports

00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,790
are specified and the CSS can actually

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,230
be tested because it's there's things

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,340
like this tight term site which

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:32,090
leveraged presentation and yeah and CSS

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:35,450
to build understanding of these terms or

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:39,530
you can just be or we can just be

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:42,260
tongue-in-cheek about it I love these

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:46,100
they're great and we could build whole

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,840
games in it now right and even if you

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,960
are like CSS is just presentation

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,470
that's fine but presentation in my

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,960
opinion influences the way people feel

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,730
about software and it governs

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:05,010
interaction there's our it enables

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:07,260
interaction and this in turn affects it

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,480
enables function because if something

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,730
isn't presented and can't be experienced

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,580
in the right way by its intended end

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:18,030
user that intended and function is

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,639
irrelevant and this is CSS right and it

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,830
deserves its place in development but

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,340
for some reason this distinction is

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,340
still made and sometimes it's not like

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,350
because it's like become a ready web

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,900
developer by learning flexbox and CSS

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,440
great so I just want to unpack why this

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:42,180
is a little bit because like it's

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,220
difficult it can be right yeah leave

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,050
that up there but we may not say

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,440
outright that CSS is really development

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,960
but the implication is there right it's

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,400
there when designers ask which coding

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,380
languages they should learn next and

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,020
which new aspects of CSS are the most

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,180
important to learn it's in job postings

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,440
it's in salaries it's everywhere

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,229
and if CSS isn't just design like what

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,620
is it now right we seem to recognize

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:12,330
this difficulty or this sort of lack of

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,220
definition but we don't yet know what to

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:18,870
do with it or how to act on it and the

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,600
important question why does any of this

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,250
matter it matters because this is an

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,410
issue without a resolution yet and that

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,810
lack of resolution has its consequences

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,770
right people are always asking what what

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:35,270
is this what am i and fluidity in roles

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,620
is totally fine because we need

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,450
responsibility and accountability to

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,260
actually build software at the end of

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,140
the day but the titles that we hold do

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,740
modder because the impacts hiring they

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,690
impact team construction perception and

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,339
pay not to mention the actual user

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,880
experience of the thing we're building

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,070
and the weights and the the gravitas

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,500
that comes with this term doesn't always

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:06,090
apply to CSS or front-end develop

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,550
and what development means to me the

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:11,400
word might be different to what it means

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,230
to you and not just what it means to

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,330
actually practice web development but

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,310
how you learned it to how you go out

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,360
there these are things that we

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,940
implicitly assign value to or devalue

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,000
the other as Theresa put it and the

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,850
impact perceptions both of ourselves and

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,870
others how we identify and perceive

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,690
ourselves and others matters and for a

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,280
couple of years now I've run this little

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,770
side project it's an interview series

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,260
with underrepresented folks in tech who

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,120
have found success and I always ask them

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,330
how they arrived in the industry

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,860
it was a by a University where they self

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,780
taught that they go to boot camp like

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,600
did they trip and fall sideways into it

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,930
like I did you know with Neopets into

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,070
your cities whatever and I won't read

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,800
these obviously but I've just

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,210
highlighted lots of quotes because

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,260
suffice it to say there's no one path

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:09,750
into this right and I asked using the

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,120
hashtag folks from the conference you

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,620
know how did how did you find

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,480
development and these were a few of the

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,130
responses that that I got and it's clear

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,380
that you know there's all these messy

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,100
journeys right that indicate that

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,840
there's so many ways to learn this too

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,730
you know but there's also a lot of

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,390
different ways to perceive ourselves and

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:36,930
yet we seem to assign more value to some

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,700
of these paths than others and that

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,440
value differs based on the person

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,600
presenting that story as well

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,100
and there is a certain gravitas once

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,530
again to a computer science degree for

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,450
example but I would argue that education

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,140
doesn't always mean expertise experience

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:58,800
or perspective but neither does self

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,970
taught either you know all this can make

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,430
for a developer but it doesn't

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,020
necessarily have to and we shouldn't

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,750
overlook or devalue those other paths

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,780
because successful development isn't

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,300
just code but communication and

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,890
interpersonal understanding diverse

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,970
journeys into the discipline give

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,649
context to that

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,199
and enable a sexually build better

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,089
software so I just encourage everyone to

00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:25,139
think about this like do you value these

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:28,709
things the same way for everyone because

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:32,579
I think there is one prevailing image of

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:36,240
the developer right and two paths that

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:39,240
sort of arrive at it one fears ice-cream

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,069
and if you're kind of sitting there

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,560
maybe I don't have a computer science to

00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,439
biro I've hired people without computer

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,300
science degrees you don't get a pass

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,980
necessarily because the lack of a

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,620
computer science degree seems to be fine

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,779
to be a developer but only if you

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,629
followed this one specific other paths

00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:59,970
which is that of this kind of hustle

00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,860
hard contribute to open source encode in

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:06,870
my spare time in every free moment that

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:09,540
I have which is an ish dominated by you

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:15,290
know the twenty-something white male and

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:17,759
we're willing to evaluate their work

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:21,149
we're willing to adjust our value

00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,089
systems based on what our perception of

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:26,370
that developer is and that's problematic

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:30,779
when our perception is valued or is

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:33,180
flawed or skewed yeah and these value

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,459
systems see I'm using my psychology

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,910
degree now just good manifests as

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,439
hierarchies in our in our brains and

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,259
hierarchies are just simply put their

00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:45,509
systems of organization and ranking they

00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,420
let us categorize and compare things

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:50,550
relatively and I'm concerned with what

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,180
happens when our understandings of

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:57,709
development and CSS are unclear unspoken

00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,180
and tied up with our perceptions of

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:03,120
ourselves and our journeys into into the

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,290
discipline and yeah in short I'm really

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,639
interested in this when things get

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:10,319
really complicated and were compelled to

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,699
understand this like we asked the

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,379
question like you saw the screenshots

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:17,639
earlier of what is development what's

00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:19,339
this we want to understand this because

00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,720
it makes our world easier to comprehend

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,120
but also because these hierarchies

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,089
affect CSS the language the community

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,620
and the web at large we pride ourselves

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,020
on the fact that any

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,540
one can be a developer and to some

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,040
degree we do celebrate that freedom and

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,620
I try to highlight it in that origins

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,680
project but we also devalue it when it's

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,500
easy for us to do that and usually this

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,450
happens when speed becomes important

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,490
because we're trying to make sense of

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,350
you know how to pay people to write how

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,520
to hire and how to actually build

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:55,560
software on time and if we can sort of

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,300
find this one mythical legitimate path a

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,580
thing that is or isn't development a

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,320
place to draw that line people are easy

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,380
to evaluate

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,960
but again identification matters and

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,760
should be clear hierarchies themselves

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,940
aren't actually the problem the problem

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,380
happens when we assign unequal value to

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,510
different languages and backgrounds

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,110
based upon our sort of implicit

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,520
assumptions and you know for example

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,330
think about how hierarchies might

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:28,280
manifest right if to you know CSS

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:31,080
developers go for the same job one is a

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,380
white male and the other perhaps a

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,970
non-binary person or a person of color

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,150
could you really honestly say that they

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,380
would be evaluated the same way maybe

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,930
maybe not right

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,930
and when we don't know or when we aren't

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,000
transparent about it we reach into our

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,580
minds for that which we do know and when

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,990
that basic knowledge is already

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,440
incorrect or perhaps biased we don't

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,540
make the best decisions so it's the

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,930
opaque nature of this that that creates

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,850
the problems right and this is where the

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,700
developer archetype kind of intersects

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,310
with our social biases right because it

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,780
means that we categorize and determine

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,950
someone's value before we've even

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,660
interacted with them and you know a CSS

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,000
developer for example might be what your

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,130
project or your organization needs but

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,890
if you don't value that as a development

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:26,070
skill you'll never get to hire that

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,410
person you'll never look for them and so

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,680
these hierarchies differ based on the

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,680
company based on the person based on the

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,480
job posts and then and then those

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,230
reading the job posting those looking at

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,280
it are left trying to infer what if you

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,250
know the last time you look for a job

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,540
think about your look

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,210
the job posting and you're trying to

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,610
infer what this person wants from you

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:51,130
and you know you pondered that and this

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,410
lack of transparency is the problem what

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,080
is perceived as hard to calculate we've

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,980
heard that already right and if we don't

00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,500
have a shared understanding of what

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,290
development is or how CSS fits into it

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,760
within our companies we can't actually

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,000
clearly communicate what it is that we

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,730
value and hierarchies are most helpful

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,170
when they're unambiguous when you know

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,540
in that case they're actually valuable

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,220
in actionable things and if they're just

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,650
floating around in the ether somewhere

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,050
though our bias is ensure that we

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:27,100
automatically favorite like skew in

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,930
favor of a certain archetype and also to

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,150
be clear I'm not saying that there isn't

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:35,700
a difference obviously between like CSS

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:39,220
HTML and languages like JavaScript even

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,530
what's dangerous are the power dynamics

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,900
and subtle implications that one is

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,850
harder and therefore better than the

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,040
other and the creation of these

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,830
developer stereotypes around them and

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,680
these biases then which implicitly kind

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:56,620
of perpetuate and this becomes ingrained

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,300
in us right and it makes us make bad

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,690
decisions and it makes us treat others

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,490
poorly even when we don't mean to write

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,010
in the same way that categorization

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:09,660
makes it easier to place people in roles

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:12,580
it also makes it easier to devalue them

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,820
so for the more we don't talk about it

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,470
and that too perpetuates the bias if I

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,270
don't know how your hierarchy differs

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,710
from mine we'll never come to a

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,060
consensus and that's really easy to

00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:27,910
ignore and whether or not our journey

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,460
has legitimacy quote-unquote or whether

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,680
or not we see CSS as quote-unquote

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,900
development has impacts on how people

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,040
perceive our skill as technicians

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,140
if you develop in CSS but don't know

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,530
ember for example are you more skilled

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,350
or valuable why are you worth more money

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,810
do you get more credibility if you

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,120
learned at a bootcamp or just built a

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:55,320
robot in your basement or you learn via

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,590
your as I did your Neopets guild page

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,960
which is better and when we perceive

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,240
people as skilled we give them power and

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,270
when those perceptions or attributions

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,110
are not transparent you know how do we

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,340
know what our value is and until now

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,650
it's been the assumptions of those

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,350
already in power that govern perception

00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:19,620
and value we say that legitimacy is

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:22,320
based on meritocracy but it's not and we

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,860
know it's not it's a bit harsh but it's

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,890
true

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,570
and this struggle for legitimacy is

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,860
especially important for the

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,980
underrepresented and the marginalized

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,810
people we need in this industry these

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,760
higher please take power away from those

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,050
who should have it to whom we should be

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,440
giving it and prevent them from taking

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,860
part people are excluded from court

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,350
reviews or courses based on perceived

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,020
language and expertise and their imprint

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,150
is lost as a result and this point

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,040
really needs belaboring because it's

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,560
about the interaction of the technical

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,210
and the social and it prevents people at

00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,400
the low end of these implicit

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,650
hierarchies from participating in our

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,000
communities and contributing to CSS

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,660
development through no fault of their

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,480
own right and this is complicated

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,910
because you know there are so many sort

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,280
of hierarchies to juggle and you know

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,920
which groups we arbitrarily assign

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,180
higher low value to right and until now

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,750
we've just kind of accepted that and

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:25,170
done very little to change it but you

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:28,650
know this also has impact on salary too

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:31,620
so if I think development is worth a lot

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,230
of money but implicitly CSS isn't real

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,650
development then CSS isn't worth as much

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,170
money pay scales become arbitrary right

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,270
if the person doing that development is

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,050
then part of a minority group we pay

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:48,570
them even less there are also mental

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,510
health consequences to this when you see

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,100
someone as less valuable in any way you

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,040
behave differently towards them again

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,620
whether you intend to or not and just

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,120
because you know you might see it as CSS

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,510
isn't real development may be you know

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,560
we say it jokingly but you know it

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,830
doesn't mean that others perceive it

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,830
that way too

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:13,290
so speaking of the products that we

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,870
build right a devaluing of CSS and

00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,130
developer journeys means you know means

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,650
an impact on that as well

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,600
remember that presentation again governs

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,810
interaction and it governs access and

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,720
therefore function and when we ignore

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,850
CSS as a as a development skill we

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,190
compromise the the language we

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:36,420
compromise the people who use it and the

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:38,280
industry by making bad software where

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,800
user experience and performance suffer

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:46,470
and yeah finally CSS splinters into its

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,670
own sub disciplines and specialties we

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,310
do have to be aware of how we're

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,180
creating an assigning value to those sub

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,650
disciplines we have the potential to

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,640
fracture these communities as they're

00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:01,200
being built and we don't want that so

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,710
what can we do then that's theoretically

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,540
I'm here I'm here to kind of offer some

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,630
hopefully a starting point and I'm not

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,820
suggesting that we get rid of what is a

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,220
fundamental human behavior right because

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,380
again hierarchies are fine they make us

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,500
feel safe they help us process the world

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,470
but what I'm saying is that they should

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,020
be transparent one enforceable and

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,670
concrete and they should be changeable

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,650
two they should be malleable right we

00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,170
should feel comfortable sharing them and

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,480
challenging them and first and foremost

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,580
right acknowledge that we will come to

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,710
the table like say we're hiring someone

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,950
with different value systems and there's

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,390
nothing inherently wrong with that we

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,210
should follow that though with with

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,850
transparency we can't confront that

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,740
which we can't see if we don't know we

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,010
disagree or we're afraid to admit that

00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,720
we disagree we can't make things better

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,140
if we aren't clear on the differences

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,580
between our own hierarchies we stripped

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,770
them of their actual effectiveness right

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,830
we can't clearly act on on any of that

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,990
so what I'm wondering is like

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,060
individually and organizationally what

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,710
would happen if we wrote down like

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,650
actually sat and tried to articulate

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,260
what we believe or what we perceive to

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,850
be a web developer and and don't just

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,250
ask the question because it's easy to

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,400
toss the question out there

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,980
but actually answer it concretely and if

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,140
these hierarchies are in theory very

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,760
obvious then it should be easy to state

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,760
them right and be accountable to them

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,990
and this is really important as well be

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,690
hyper aware and be honest with each

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,820
other like check assumptions not just at

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,910
the door but throughout we can call each

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,980
other on them and in organizations this

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,950
takes vulnerability you have to trust

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,840
your coworkers and those who are not

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,530
marginalized or underrepresented have to

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,970
take that first step and again you may

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,830
have different perceptions even within

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,890
the team of what for an end development

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:03,500
or engineering is and what qualification

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,900
or journey is expected for someone to be

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,670
successful in your company but you just

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,770
need to be open about it and if you

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,750
don't want to or hesitate to then

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,870
chances are the hierarchy that you have

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:19,190
isn't necessarily a good one

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,690
and those who have hiring power can get

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,300
across to people that we value the skill

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,570
that they bring not the language that

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,370
the skill manifests in if we can shout

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,490
about CSS is development we can and

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,990
should focus on the skillsets and

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,660
perspectives that people are bringing to

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,330
us because inclusivity is difficult

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,070
enough without questions about how or

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,050
where we acquired those development

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,900
skills or which are development skills

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,090
to begin with and that's it kind of in

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,520
the meantime those who are juniors or

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,960
those who are looking for jobs we know

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,240
now that you know there's this gravitas

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,160
to the word developer technical

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,410
proficiency tied up with credibility

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,170
right that for some reason CSS doesn't

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,580
always get and use the word to your

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,990
advantage right don't be afraid to call

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,330
yourself a developer if you feel that

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:13,490
you are right and in a broad context

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:15,740
this this approach means putting

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,630
minority groups in decision-making roles

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,200
and challenging hierarchies by deviating

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:24,740
from them we pride ourselves so often on

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,950
being an innovative industry so let's be

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:31,940
innovative in our teams and in the roles

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,870
rather than just in our software and so

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,460
I ask this

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:39,500
in the title of my talk and in true kind

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,870
of Canadian fashion I suppose my answer

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,320
is a bit of a cop-out I'm sorry about

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,100
that

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,650
because it depends right but we can take

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,570
a step back and ask what shouldn't make

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:54,440
one like and why do we feel that it

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:56,690
shouldn't lines you know lines are

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,940
arbitrary sometimes lines are lines are

00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,960
boring we don't all have to agree on

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,870
what should or shouldn't make a

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,460
developer I'm not saying a universal

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,370
definition would be so general so as to

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,289
be pointless but it's worth knowing what

00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:13,610
you value and what your organization

00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:16,549
values and I acknowledge very much that

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,370
this isn't an easy thing to do because

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:23,179
removing lines like this means adding

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,760
complexity and what I'm proposing here

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,700
is that those of us who think these

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,169
hierarchies are so obvious actually take

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,110
a good look at them document them and

00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:35,929
make them an open thing and if it is

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,429
obvious that'll be an easy exercise and

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:40,010
it'll make you feel good about your

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:42,169
honesty and transparency but if it isn't

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,169
then trying to articulate then will be

00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:47,480
beneficial to the organization do so and

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,140
I'm not talking about right or wrong

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,830
here either

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,510
just openness it's a small step was like

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,330
incremental correctness we called it

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,950
right we don't have to go all the way we

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,529
just have to take yeah

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,029
the first step and only then can we

00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:05,720
actually drive meaningful change in one

00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:08,570
direction or another and like and none

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,309
of this is easy right but but so what

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,080
it's it's fine to be finding our way

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,570
it's it's fine to be uncomfortable with

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,760
disagreement but what's not fine is

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,470
allowing these myths to kind of fester

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,970
and impact people negatively because

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,490
we're avoiding having our opinions

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:26,929
challenged right and it's funny to me

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:29,210
sometimes that we are quick to use

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:31,490
disagreement or not quick to use it but

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:35,600
that it we use this agreement to improve

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:37,760
CSSS code or improve languages right but

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,340
not to improve the environments of the

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,309
people who write in those languages or

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,330
our understanding of their skills right

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,680
or challenging these one-dimensional

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,650
archetypes

00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,500
so in these interpersonal situations it

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,030
is hard to admit you know to ourselves

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,070
and to others that we may have hurt

00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:57,890
someone else especially if we were

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,930
acting with good intentions but it's

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,970
okay to make a mistake because again

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,800
we're still finding our way what matters

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,360
is that we put our money where our

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,770
mouths are and actually learn from our

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,360
failures like we say we do and no I

00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,450
don't provide a neat solution and again

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,040
I'm sorry but this this new

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,560
understanding I don't I don't believe

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,100
it's optional because we pride ourselves

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,710
again on unsolvable

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,540
so let's solve this one right empower

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,900
development and interaction and

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,820
perspective of all kinds and figure it

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,550
out together all right we can come

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,020
together on a if we can't come together

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,090
in a common definition or we don't want

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,380
to we can at least be open about the

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,420
definition of development that we are

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,300
working with and understand that there

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,450
are many paths in into this and value

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,460
them equally and I first gave this talk

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,740
a while back or a version of it and

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,740
since then we have kind of partially

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,700
acknowledge how hard CSS is can be and

00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,850
that's a step in the right direction

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,590
right we recognize the need for

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,170
legitimacy in recognizing each other's

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,690
journeys and each other's disciplines

00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:07,490
and I believe that this is worthwhile

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,280
right again we can start with

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,690
incremental correctness acknowledge the

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,380
value of your journey and that of the

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:20,000
persons next to you I love love hearing

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:22,850
about how people in development like how

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,130
it found them and grabbed them and

00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,590
didn't let go and I love finding new

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,780
ways to perceive it we can always change

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,550
our hierarchies and better understand

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,210
the relationship of CSS to the rest of

00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,680
the web and when we better know what we

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,590
value and when we communicate better

00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,510
what we value and how we can know where

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,750
to spend our energies right how to put

00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,960
together better teams and make better

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,650
software and make sure that our

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,640
community the community that we're

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,960
building here today and when we go home

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,690
like we can make that community as

00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,850
amazing as we know it can be both

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,830
technically and otherwise

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:06,060
so thank you so very much for listening

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:08,730
to me for sticking around and I now hand

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,060
it over to early not to close thank you

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,060
so much

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,060
