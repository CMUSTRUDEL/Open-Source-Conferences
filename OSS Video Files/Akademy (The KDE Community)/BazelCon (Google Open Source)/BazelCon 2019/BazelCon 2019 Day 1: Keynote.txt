so with that I'd like to introduce Jeff

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,460
Atwood blogger at coding founder

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,759
of Stack Overflow and discourse yes Jeff

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,960
thanks Jeremy I'll give it to you even

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,930
if you don't hi thanks for having me

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,760
thanks for coming and good morning so I

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,289
wanted to talk to you about failure so

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,000
if you don't know who I am I'm Jeff

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,949
Atwood I was co-founder of Stack

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,230
Overflow and my current project is

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,669
discourse which is an open-source sort

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,219
of teamwork tool okay for them so one of

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,050
the first things you you you hear about

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,460
in software is like you know failure is

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,290
not an option this is sort of the meme

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,149
that goes around like you have to

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,070
succeed at all costs but this is hard

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,180
right like the idea that like we're just

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,170
gonna do everything right we're not

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,760
gonna fail because we're you can do

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,309
everything the right way obviously

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,070
right that's kind of a difficult ideal

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,660
to live up to so for example this is a

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,160
picture that went around on social media

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,020
that's quite funny take a good look at

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,000
this and we'll drill into this like the

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,729
the crazy that's going on in this

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,320
picture because there's like who would

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,450
do this right like why is this even

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,640
possible so if you're drilling for

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,380
example you know there's there's there's

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,450
these are propped up on like like bricks

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,020
right the ladders are on bricks which

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,020
doesn't even make sense

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,610
there's gas propane cylinders under that

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,720
for additional excitement I guess and

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,250
you have this sort of high load a piece

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,810
of wood that's being held down with

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,520
apparently in a car engine

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,810
so the funniest thing about this though

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,970
was the observation that this is

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,770
basically how we do software right it's

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,630
just a bunch of crap piled on a bunch of

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:46,560
crap which somehow works right and we're

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,600
not sure why or how so but I actually

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,070
when I started Stack Overflow I had the

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,869
opposite mindset which is I want to

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,240
actually embrace failure I want to have

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,340
the idea that that not not that I'm

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,170
going to fail but that failure is always

00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,579
looming the idea that you're not going

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,049
to make it is always there on the

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,329
horizon and actually a very likely

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,770
outcome and most software projects so I

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,320
think embracing that is actually more

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,989
healthy and I can actually prove it

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,430
because this is actually in discourse

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,080
which is very exciting I got them to

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,890
migrate their forum to discourse but on

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,900
this forum

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,700
2008 you can check the date there March

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,540
2008 I was like look I'm gonna do this

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,310
thing but I'm probably gonna fail right

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,480
cuz you know you just want to be humble

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,670
about what you're doing and also

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,040
realistic about your chances and also

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,530
think about what's what's waiting for

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,390
you out there so if for some reason you

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,930
haven't seen Stack Overflow here it is

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,340
in Russian just to freak you out because

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,860
I figure you've seen Stack Overflow but

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,850
have you seen it in Russian right

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,590
exciting so this is sort of the the

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,420
shocking truth I'm going to tell you is

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,770
that success is actually kind of boring

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,030
because there's a lot of people that

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,590
have get up on stage and they'll say

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,690
look I was super successful look at all

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,489
the stuff I did but they weren't really

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,060
successful they were actually just lucky

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,560
and that's okay because luck is a huge

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,300
factor in success and you got to do

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,100
everything right at the right time with

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,600
the right team with the right there's a

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,890
bunch of factors you can't control even

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,630
if you're the most talented person in

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,209
the world you can still fail it's not

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,770
your fault right it's okay actually so a

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,150
lot of times when you see people up here

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,739
realize they're the people with a giant

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,930
printed check when hey look at this

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,100
pretty nice check right all cuz I'm

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,299
awesome right

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,459
or maybe you just got a little lucky and

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,890
will write famous you know game

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,989
developer actually said that he

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,290
preferred hiring people that had a

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,850
history of understanding why they failed

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,650
versus coming in saying look at all the

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,269
successful stuff I did I did all this I

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,739
did all this it was perfect everything

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,180
went great they're like well I had some

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,320
bad outcomes but here they were and

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,989
here's what I did about them and here's

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,060
how I you know overcame those and will

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,920
write as an incredibly accomplished

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,010
software developer so if will write is

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,780
telling you that he values the the

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,890
learning you get from failure I think

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,380
that's something you should internalize

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:03,870
into your career and think about in

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,670
everything that you do so it's a process

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,500
of iteration right like that's how you

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,400
learn you don't actually learn that much

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,019
from success

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,610
everything was essentially given to you

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,019
it's like the whole privilege argument

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,400
right like well I just happened to be

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,660
rich I just happen to have rich parents

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,919
I just happen to go to a really good

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,019
school and then I just happen to get a

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,740
really great job because I'm awesome

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,090
right so the idea is failure and also

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,919
when you're pushing yourself and you're

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,110
actually trying I don't say trying to

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,240
feel but like working

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,710
at the boundary of your skill level so

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,759
that you're at the edge of what you can

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,159
do and you're like I don't know if I can

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,379
do this that's where you should be okay

00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:38,120
you shouldn't be in a job where you're

00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,710
like this is easy everything's easy I

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,930
don't have to stress like you should be

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,879
stressing a little need to push to

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,949
really understand so another good

00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,680
example of this is they did a study to

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,759
understand what makes a good surgeon and

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,379
what makes a bad surgeons because

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,449
surgeon is a job you don't want to screw

00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:55,310
up right particularly if you're the

00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,310
person that's on the table you want that

00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,539
person to be extremely competent and

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,219
essentially never fail right but is that

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,560
realistic to surgeons feeling I'm sure

00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:07,099
they fail so they came up with a series

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,439
of questions that they found let them

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:10,639
distinguish the good surgeons who were

00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,590
good at the job from the ones that were

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,259
bad at the job and this was the question

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,219
have you ever made a mistake and if so

00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:21,830
what was your worst mistake the worst

00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:25,370
surgeons would say things like this I

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,159
don't make mistakes or there were things

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,080
that happened but they weren't my fault

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:31,969
right those were the bad surgeons that

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
you would be terrified of the outcomes

00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:37,690
that they had the good surgeons would

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,250
say things like I make a lot of mistakes

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,930
right and here's a mistake I made the

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,800
other day and here's what I did about it

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,690
right they're willing to acknowledge

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,550
rethink what they had done and imagine

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,139
doing it better the next time they were

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,610
learning from the mistakes they made

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,719
rather than pretending that they don't

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,089
make mistakes because we all make

00:05:53,719 --> 00:06:00,589
mistakes right they internalized that

00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:01,909
process of learn iterate repeat so

00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,289
you've probably seen this diagram it's

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:06,409
gone around on social media it's quite

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:09,219
famous it's this is a diagram of the

00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:11,629
surviving where wilt war World War two

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,949
bombers right what they looked like when

00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,479
they came back the red dots are

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,189
obviously like bullet holes and damage

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,020
so you might look at this and think well

00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:21,169
what can I learn from this you think

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:24,110
well I need to armor up those areas that

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,750
are taking the most damage well that

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,219
would be a fatal mistake because what

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,319
you're seeing is the planes that came

00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,599
back these are the successes you're only

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,279
looking at successful bombers they made

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,360
their bombing run they took some damage

00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,430
but they survived those areas were the

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,389
opposite of where you put the armor you

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,370
actually want the armor

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,659
engine and the other areas that were

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,360
undamaged on those guys

00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,219
so if you're looking at only success my

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,740
point is you're not seeing the whole

00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:53,389
picture you're seeing the wrong part of

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,520
the picture you need to see those

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,879
failures understand them to understand

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,039
what you need to fix for the future so

00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,990
to wit failure is actually the

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,520
interesting part of this job so that's

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,469
why we're talking about it even to the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,319
point that like again as you saw with me

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:14,270
in March 2008 I was obsessed with how am

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,060
I gonna screw this up what am I gonna do

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,039
wrong how am I gonna essentially defeat

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,569
myself in this Dever and I was

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,550
constantly in the back of my mind to the

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,620
point that failure is always an option

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,819
was like a mantra on the stackoverflow

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,229
team I don't say it is as much a

00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,840
discourse because we're open source we

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:33,349
can't fail right it's not possible you

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,580
guys know how to this oh yeah we really

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,800
internalized this and I think it really

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,960
helped us and I think it can help you

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,879
too so the three things I want to look

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,800
at are first of all industry-wide how is

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,529
the industry feeling first before we

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,050
even talk about any of this think about

00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:51,020
in software how do we tend to screw up

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,849
okay this way you can get the benefit of

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,250
failing without actually failing right

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,659
you can look at what other people are

00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,550
doing say oh look at those people they

00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:02,210
failed horribly we won't be doing that

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,740
right and this is primarily through the

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,060
post-mortem like one way I love to look

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,860
at this is the post more it's kind of a

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,900
morbid phrase but maybe that's

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,689
appropriate for the topic at hand you

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,250
know it means after death the when

00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,229
someone has died why did they die how

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,659
did they die you know all that stuff and

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,159
as applied to software so it's the way

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,539
we document the fact that everyone's

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,689
making the same mistakes over and over

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,689
and can't stop right so that's the thing

00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,520
we want to fix here and there's some

00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,900
really good collections of post-mortems

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,029
and I think where people also mess up

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,529
here is they look at successes they

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,019
think oh I want to be like I don't

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,550
Google or you know Microsoft or Amazon

00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,019
or somebody that's some company that's

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,459
really successful but I think what's

00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,870
really interesting is look at the ones

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:43,820
that actually failed this is I mean

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,019
Thera knows is like a bag of crazy right

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,350
like if you haven't read this it's

00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:50,779
really good the HBO is series is soso

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,300
but um the book is amazing and it will

00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:54,940
blow your mind some failures right look

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,960
at thier nose look at other less

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,340
exciting failures but look at the

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,600
failures but failures aren't really sexy

00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,950
so nobody says I just can't wait to

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,870
study these five companies that failed

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,300
and yet that is where you will learn the

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,800
most about what you're trying to do in

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,630
game development I love game developed

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,910
because it's super hard you have to

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,110
optimize for fun what is fun like how

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,300
does that even work

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,160
it's super technical involves GPUs it

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,960
involves AI involves really really hard

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,520
coding scenarios and your game may

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,770
totally fail because it just wasn't fun

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,380
right even if you did a brilliant job on

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,550
the AI so this is this is a pressure

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,230
cooker

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,820
I think game development is one of the

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,320
best places to look for pathologies in

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,910
software development there's an awesome

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,740
collection here it's also online on

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,120
Gamasutra highly recommend that and

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,190
there's just like a ton of games and

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,530
like if you like games like all of these

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,990
projects have really interesting lessons

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,250
to learn from and it's gaming so it's

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,020
kind of fun and you know a little bit

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,360
interesting so that's one of the primary

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,680
places I like to look for pathology as

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,170
the software elements you get this

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,360
pressure cooker this hot house on caming

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,980
that really puts the whole team on edge

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,480
and you're gonna see pathologies there

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,540
that you'll see on any software project

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,030
but faster in gaming in my opinion

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,960
they're high stakes high stress so if

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,610
you're familiar with show gilligan's

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,110
island I love this metaphor it's

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,150
actually Steve McConnell sort of my

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,680
patron saint Steve McConnell it's his

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,750
analogy but I love it because on a

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,220
Gilligan's Island the theme of the show

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,200
is that you have these these people

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,430
stuck on an island there's a shipwreck

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,510
they're on this island they can't get

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,490
off they have no way to get off this

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,830
island right so they're on this island

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,960
but every day this is the theme of the

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,910
show every week there's a new scheme to

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,470
get off the island right some crazy

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,940
contraption some crazy thing they're

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,890
gonna do to get off the island and

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,640
finally get back to civilization off

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,700
this you know really isolated island

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,410
Terron but it always fails right it

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,420
always fails there's always stuck on the

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,030
island for next week somehow because of

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,560
the magic of television right and that's

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,660
I feel like where a lot of software is

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,150
you know we're kind of stuck on the

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,610
island because we can't internalize the

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,390
lessons of what happened the last time

00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,490
and if some of these are really famous

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,720
right so there's 36 classic software

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,130
development takes that Steve McConnell

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,780
talks about and I think it's a good

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,220
starting point you're thinking okay Jeff

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,649
I don't wanna do all this reading I

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,660
don't care about Gamasutra just

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,879
tell me the answer well the answer is

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,050
look at this list of 36 classic software

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,519
development tanks and think and every

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,050
one of them good endless are we making

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,199
this mistake are we making this mistake

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,670
and just everyday if you're the PM or

00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,740
whoever's job that is to think about

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,660
that go down the list and mythical

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,819
man-month is of course the classic

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,649
mistake of will just add people to make

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:31,480
this project go faster which doesn't

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,160
work because those people are our cost

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,259
to the project and it takes time to get

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,540
them up to speed plus those people may

00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:39,970
have pathologies of their own right so

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,839
that's just one and here's the full list

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,069
I mean you can look it up but it's great

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,499
to just like health check this

00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:48,610
constantly I mean just in the back your

00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,470
mind it's kind of like you get up in the

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,089
morning do I have my keys to my wallet

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,100
do I have my backpack do I have my

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,319
coffee this is the stuff you should do

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,939
every day on a project in my opinion to

00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,100
make sure you're not running into those

00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:03,429
problems so your goal should be we're

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,980
gonna make all new mistakes that no one

00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:09,129
has seen before that are incredibly

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,170
complicated and giant explosions so that

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,670
should kind of be your goal a new

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,829
mistakes are very very interesting

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,089
actually old mistakes are boring because

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,370
you should have avoided them and you

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:22,170
should have seen them coming so that's

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:25,079
the way you should think of this

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,790
so speaking of all new never seen

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,370
spectacular failure modes this show came

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,689
out on HBO and it is amazing it's like

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,850
one of the best things I've seen and

00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:35,079
it's a five-part miniseries it's one of

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,579
the best things I've seen in maybe a

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,920
decade actually it's really good and

00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,139
it's such a good metaphor for software

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,350
engineering I strongly recommend you to

00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:46,269
watch this show and I'll get into

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,160
details as to why but you know when

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,529
you're talking about spectacular

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,600
never-before-seen failures one of the

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,910
chilling lines in the show is this is a

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,040
situation that has never occurred on the

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,379
planet earth and I got a chill when he

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,689
said that I was like god that's amazing

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,429
right like it's bad but it's also

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,929
incredible right like from an

00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:08,139
engineering standpoint like how did we

00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:10,480
get here no one has ever seen this in

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:14,799
the history of planet Earth right such a

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,019
powerful show and it's well funny is not

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,410
the right word it was during a safety

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,680
test that this happened right so the

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,649
whole thing

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,779
triggered by them trying to test for

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:31,999
failure which led to a catastrophic

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:33,740
failure so that's the line that's the

00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:35,029
scene that's the line love that line and

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,850
get chills every time I see it

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,050
and it's just so well done the actors

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,249
are incredible it's it's a little

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,170
disconcerting that they speak in British

00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,519
accents which is hard to parse you're

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,179
like okay it's Russian but they're

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:51,589
British but if you can get past that it

00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:54,350
works beautifully okay so that's

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:57,230
industry failures so you also want to

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,910
look at your team specific failure modes

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,009
you want to have a record of like what

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,170
we've done that did not work and why

00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:05,149
right and in the show they do a

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,970
brilliant job of this of they show you

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:09,649
the essentially the accident and then

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,439
the rest of the show is them piecing

00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:14,389
together how they got there step-by-step

00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,619
and it takes a long time to figure all

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,809
that out because they thought it was

00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:19,639
literally impossible to get to where

00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,959
they were and you've seen this in code

00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,459
all the time it's like there's no way

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,050
this can be happening there's no way

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,499
this code being can be getting hit this

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:31,910
way but it is right so the impossible is

00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:34,490
what you have to figure out so we use

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:36,620
discourse a lot for this what you're

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,480
seeing here is a list of post-mortem so

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,850
on our project on discourse sorry I

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,069
touched like this is where we screwed up

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,170
right this is a record of our failures

00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:47,029
things that we did not get right that

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,290
caused outages because we're essentially

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:51,399
hosting business that's how we make

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,389
money it's open source people to sell it

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,420
so yeah you need to have something like

00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:58,040
this in your project where like show me

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,839
all the ways in which we fail that I can

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,459
learn from and this is critical this is

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,759
required to discourse anything that's

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,110
like a significant outage for some

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,720
reasonable definition of significant

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,319
there's always a topic and we discuss it

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,069
and we talk about how this happened

00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:15,230
starting with the timeline the timeline

00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:16,879
and Inter Noble again they do such a

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,009
brilliant job of nailing the timeline

00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,220
and the last episode is really chilling

00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:23,449
because they go through it and

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,369
second-by-second finally you get to see

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,420
what actually happened and that's what

00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,829
you're trying to piece together right

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,809
that's why it's at the end of the show

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,249
because at the end of the show you get

00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,170
to see the full story they've figured

00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,549
out the answer which takes time like why

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,760
is this happening how is this happening

00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,100
so the first thing

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,350
start with as a timeline like what when

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,740
did this begin and when did it end and

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,140
then all the events in between so one

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,170
thing you are optimizing here for here

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,500
is how quickly you can figure out like

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,780
basically what the problem is we burn a

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,560
lot of time at discourse like is this a

00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,760
DDoS we still deal with that crap or is

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,950
it something that we actually cause in

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,360
software so you do there are things you

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,670
want to optimize here for and I think

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,040
one of the critical ones is how can we

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,080
just diagnose it faster like you know

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,250
like the classic show house like you

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:17,690
know is it scurvy is it mumps some crazy

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,690
unheard-of disease like that's the thing

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,590
yes so again you want to fix it you want

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,360
to get the fix and then at the end of it

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,070
how can we fix it even faster next time

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,660
how can we improve this process for next

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,330
time how can we add more Diagnostics

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,310
more feedback into the system so that

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:39,290
when this happens it's eat both easier

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:41,400
to identify and also easier to fix and

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,710
it's really simple it's basically just

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,090
writing things down right like literally

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,470
because you're in the middle of a crisis

00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,090
right like we've run a hosting business

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,460
our customers are pissed because their

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,460
sites aren't available and I'm upset

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,810
because you know our company looks bad

00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,250
but really it's just learning to write

00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,720
things down as you go so you have a

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:02,370
record for piecing it together later and

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,330
you have to take notes everybody has to

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,120
take notes it could be your like your

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,010
internal chat system it could be

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,589
something like discourse but there's

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,089
almost like a scribe role that if you

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,470
look at like incident response plans

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,790
there's like somebody who takes the role

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,320
of the scribe I will write down

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,650
everything that's happening so we can

00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,570
piece this together later and intra

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,010
noble again they do such a brilliant job

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,930
of illustrating this it's such a great

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,600
engineering story there's this composite

00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,580
character she represents twenty or

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,580
thirty actual Russian scientists who

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,680
were there interviewing everybody taking

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,660
notes looking at everything to happen

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,010
trying to figure out what happened and

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,500
you see her literally writing know she

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,720
has pages and pages of notes of these

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,240
books and she drops them on the guys

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,830
like look this is this is the story I've

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,910
pieced it together I've taken the notes

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,940
I've interviewed everybody and this is

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,120
what we have

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:56,200
and that's the role you need to have on

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,760
your software team and another thing to

00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,770
think about that also illustrated

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,310
brilliantly in Chernobyl is am I'm

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,750
making it worse now I know as the

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,460
pointy-haired boss like I've been guilty

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,200
of this for a lot of our Incident

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,760
Response I try to like stand back I'm

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,200
like oh I'll just update Twitter right

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll just let people know we're having

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,530
an issue I'm not gonna interfere I'm not

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,500
gonna like micromanage people and

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,910
there's this great character if you've

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,720
seen Chernobyl this joke will be funny

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:25,840
and if you haven't it won't I apologize

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,640
but the main guy just refuses to believe

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,020
that the reactor has exploded he's like

00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,740
well I saw pieces on the ground say nope

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,930
you didn't see that not possible and

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,290
then the other great line is they've

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,150
maxed out their dosage meters like

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,620
they're just literally pegged and he's

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,300
like oh it's 3.6 like but that's the

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,460
maxes like not it's fine it's not great

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,750
not terrible three point six of course

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,400
the actual dosage was far far higher

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,850
because the meters were essentially off

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,060
the scale right but again am i making it

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,340
worse so one way to not make it worse

00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,620
is not try to be the person with the

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,450
answers but try to be the person sort of

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,250
asking the questions like why did this

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,470
happen why did this happen what this

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,570
happened and helping drill in to figure

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,130
out you know the classic five why's

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,780
right until you get to why you get to

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:15,040
God basically I guess the end of all

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,750
that right because God another thing to

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,290
think about is there's this great movie

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,940
called

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,000
Charlie Victor Rome you know it's really

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,990
kind of chilling it's cockpit voice

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,750
recorders of plane flights that did not

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,970
make it and they recreate it in real

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,950
time with actors and actresses it's

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:38,740
called Charlie Victor Romeo which is

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:41,140
cockpit voice recorder it's chilling but

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,800
it's also profound because it shows you

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,240
the power of just hearing the story of

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,610
what actually happened to this flight

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,410
right in real time like how did this

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,040
happen how can we avoid this in the

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:56,620
future you know how can we address this

00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,250
so it doesn't have to happen again so

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,690
the final part I want to think about is

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,559
anticipating future failure this is

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,649
where it gets spect

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,970
you live right like you've looked at

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:08,740
industry-wide these are the ways that we

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,149
fail typically right we add people to a

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,100
project thinking it'll go faster

00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:14,620
obviously it doesn't that's a common

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,799
failure mode you can look at your team's

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,230
post mortems what have we messed up in

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,120
the past where are we weak where do we

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,600
need to be stronger what can we be

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,370
smarter and faster at but you also have

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,370
to have enough metrics that you can see

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,720
failure coming before it happens and

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:37,629
there's another I love the show where

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,679
he's being interviewed and he's like

00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,179
well we don't need to worry about that

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,759
because they want to fix the reactors

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,830
this reactor type the rbk reactor has a

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,590
lot of flaws because they made it too

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,330
cheaply essentially and he's like no we

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,700
gotta go back and fix them and the the

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,200
the politbureau guys like why worry

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,980
about something that isn't gonna happen

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,580
right and that's our job our job is to

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:04,799
worry about things that shouldn't happen

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,799
and we don't want to happen right so

00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:10,330
safety system test so one thing to think

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,399
about it Chernobyl what triggered all

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,039
those events was the safety test so what

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:17,440
safety tests do you do on your software

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,679
what does that look like how do you

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,789
build safety tests so we're this course

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,619
is an open source project we're on

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:27,399
github like many open source projects

00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:30,460
every check-in in discourse results in a

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:34,119
build for us ok and that bill goes live

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:36,249
to meta discourse org so every check-in

00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,009
and check ins are vetted right we're not

00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:40,149
just blindly accepting every check-in

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,100
eventually results in code being

00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,590
deployed to our live production support

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,990
site so I think that's a good way of

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,389
keeping our project honest so for

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:55,840
example here's one build triggered off a

00:21:49,389 --> 00:22:00,369
check-in this is our build system I mean

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:04,629
we use Jenkins as the front end and the

00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:07,029
other sort of interesting thing about

00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:10,389
our build system is every time we get a

00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:13,000
check-in off github we build a docker

00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:16,030
image of discourse we deploy the docker

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,490
image on a server and then

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:21,130
smoke tests against that deployed docker

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,790
image and only if those smoke tests pass

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,900
like do I have a rendered screen of

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,450
recognizable text right like do I have

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,190
the UI can i login only then as the

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:34,120
build mark is a passing build that we

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,010
can then deploy to meta discourse org so

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,600
that's one way to run an automated

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,160
safety test like nobody can check-in

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,170
something on discourse that completely

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,210
breaks the entire project and this has

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,820
saved us many many many times right and

00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,070
I think this is like table stakes for a

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,720
lot of projects you know does your build

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,090
work does it result in something that

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,310
users can interact with you know are you

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,930
completely broken yes or no and that's

00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:02,100
just the beginning of what you can do

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:05,020
here we also have an alert system so

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,340
alerts for us feed into discourse so

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,460
what you're seeing here is a category

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:12,730
called alerts and in this category we're

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,430
seeing any live alerts of things that

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,290
look unusual to us like for example

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,430
puppet wasn't running on servers and we

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,660
use puppet to orchestrate all our

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,310
servers so if puppets not running that's

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,110
really weird on a server like there's no

00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,310
way to for that server to talk to us

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,980
right we can't do anything to that

00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,000
server and the other interesting thing

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,250
about this is you can see these are

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,170
actual conversations you can see the

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,550
uploads are missing in s3 there's a

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,320
conversation going on there but like why

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,030
is this happening how is this happening

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,040
like what can we do about it's like a

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,450
mini post-mortem it's not it's not big

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,970
enough to justify like a full

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,410
post-mortem like we were down but it's a

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,640
mini post-mortem that's basically what

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,350
that is a conversation about like why is

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,700
it still happening how can we make it so

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,980
this lore doesn't need to happen in the

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:58,030
future or how can we avoid the system in

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:59,110
the future so here's a build job for

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,540
example that's failing so this would be

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,930
an actual topic that I showed you in

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,770
that topic list and if you scroll down a

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,260
little bit more you're gonna see the

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,150
conversation about this with Sam about

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,850
like why is this happening pinging

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,170
vinoth to look at it all the

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:21,010
conversations you want to have about

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:22,840
what's going on in addition to that we

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,040
have again we're talking about safety

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,240
check system so we talked about the

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,890
build system we talked about alerts

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,330
letting you know when thresholds are

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,740
being reached when things look weird

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,040
like the the vol

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,990
ms2 hi we have external monitoring wells

00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,270
this is Pingdom we've since switched to

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:40,360
status layer status cake I think it's

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,920
called we had some issues with ipv6

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,480
routing with Pingdom that we're very

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,370
very annoying actually

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,990
but yeah that's another way of keeping

00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,929
yourself honest like from the outside

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,030
world are you alive yes or no you know

00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,500
it's kind of a fancy way of you know is

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,809
this site down or not but still very

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,010
effective and keeps us honest right we

00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,440
can actually show this to customers like

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:07,179
we externally monitor to make sure we're

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:09,190
still alive we also have every copy of

00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:10,450
discourse ships with something called

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,929
log store which is like an internal

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,370
logging mechanism so if we have internal

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,720
errors in your discourse you can

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,809
actually drill into those as the site

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,920
owner and go to slash logs the URL that

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,330
you see in the address bar there and

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,620
this is completely open source which is

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,700
kind of rare in the Ruby world for

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,830
whatever reason there's a lot of paid

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,540
error logging services we're like no we

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,280
don't want that we want everybody who

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,410
installs discourse and is the

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,760
administrator has the ability to go in

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,800
and look at all the errors that they're

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,330
seeing from discourse that we think may

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,670
or may not should be there and you also

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,910
have some arguments about like ok you

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,350
logging you have errors warnings and

00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,900
informational well who gets this to

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,220
decide something is informational who

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,780
gets to decide something as a warning

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,320
and how do we know if something's really

00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,370
an error so there's a lot of sort of

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,770
negotiations that have to go on around

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,900
is this really an error is this just

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,850
informational is that a warning how much

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,100
is too much and I want to have those

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,110
conversations with our customers too you

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,460
know like I want to expose some of the

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,290
login to them so they can tell me well

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,570
Jeff like when I'm seeing all these

00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,010
weird errors on my site that tells me

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,240
that things aren't healthy and I might

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,710
agree with them right maybe I'm not

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,990
seeing that on my instance because it's

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,870
not configured like their instance so

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,490
I'm sharing that role with the community

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,170
in an open-source way like help us help

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,480
you like when you see errors in your

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,470
logs and they make you there too many or

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,190
you don't feel like that's the right

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,690
situation come to us and maybe that just

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,130
should be informational you know maybe

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,770
that doesn't need to be exists there but

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,360
it's a very very sophisticated logging

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,760
system which is again unusual in the

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,169
Ruby world and we explicitly open

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,710
sourced it for that reason so everybody

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:43,710
could benefit

00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,640
here's an example of logging rates

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,290
this is sidekick job so we have

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,270
background tasks that perform in this

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,580
course there's a lot of background stuff

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,230
that goes on with this course but if

00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,030
those jobs queue up too much it means

00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,340
you know something the queue isn't

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,200
running basically background jobs aren't

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,980
happening so here's an example of sort

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,419
of we're seeing cataclysmic levels of in

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,190
queueing of jobs that aren't being

00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,780
performed on our hosting so that's

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,940
telling us that stuff is broken right

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,150
before it's broken you can anticipate

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,440
that it's going to break because this

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,620
mountain is gonna get ever and ever

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,320
higher right so setting those levels and

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,809
deciding where you're gonna alert and

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,940
where you're gonna say you know sound

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,460
the Klaxons everything is broken is very

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,830
much an art and a negotiation Allart

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,660
with your team like are people even

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,250
looking at these stats first of all like

00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,900
you could have seen this coming right if

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,730
you had if somebody had looked at this

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,410
and you set up alert thresholds for this

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,610
particular metric you would have seen

00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,929
this coming

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,340
and maybe that's the outcome of a

00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,660
post-mortem at the end of the postmarks

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,460
like we should have been monitoring the

00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,350
stat and we should have alerted when it

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,520
got to X level then we could have

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,630
avoided this in the future

00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,610
right that's what it's all about so here

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:59,040
we have another example of stuff you can

00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,730
alert on it's just error rates HTTP

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,870
requests errors right like 500s a lot of

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,450
companies do a pretty good job of this

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,100
and it's another really standard metric

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,080
to look at is like how many pages are

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,240
loading how many pages are returning

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:19,049
errors and four of fours and any spike

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:22,200
in that is bad for you but I think the

00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:25,710
end State for all of this is to think

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,870
not how can I fix this for myself not

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,790
how can I fix this for my team or my

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,070
project but how can I fix this for all

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,540
software developers I think that's where

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,650
it gets really really interesting and

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,630
that's where you start thinking about

00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,590
the field as a whole and how we can do

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,900
better engineering and that's why again

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:46,110
Chernobyl was so inspiring because

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,549
spoiler what happens in Chernobyl the

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,799
final thing they get to at the last

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,679
episode is the realization that this is

00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:55,770
a button called a z5 that's how they say

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,740
it I think their Z is a three and

00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,940
that's why he said that's the scram

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,760
button we call it the scram button in

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,380
the u.s. that means shut down the

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,390
nuclear reactor immediately just just

00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,140
insert all the control rods cool

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,620
everything down

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,450
well the kicker is in Chernobyl this was

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,580
basically the blow up the reactor button

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,290
and the conditions they were in right

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,010
which they didn't know they had no idea

00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,960
and like no engineer working at that

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,420
facility could reasonably have been

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,980
expected to think when you press the

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,020
scram button when you press a Zed five

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,110
your reactors gonna explode

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,080
right and that's the thing that they

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,929
have to fix right that's the big

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,559
realization at the end of Chernobyl is

00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:39,450
even though they've dealt with the

00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,850
Chernobyl disaster they haven't dealt

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,700
with the fact that there are this many

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,460
rbk reactors in the Soviet Union and all

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,320
of them are vulnerable to this problem

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,910
in the right conditions and you can see

00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:56,970
some of these are actually still active

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:59,429
like now right now so the challenge for

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,500
them the people working at trouble the

00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:04,290
scientists was to convince the

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,559
politicians that they had to do this

00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:10,250
they had to go back and fix not just

00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,960
Chernobyl but all the rbk reactors at

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,960
considerable expense to the Soviet Union

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,710
right it wasn't a free or cheap

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,530
operation but that's kind of what I want

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:25,920
for us as an industry like I want us to

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:28,710
look at every software project and think

00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,980
how can we do this better how can we fix

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,410
this so no team has to suffer these

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:39,750
failure modes no customer no user has to

00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:42,470
suffer these failure modes and that's

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,630
all I have thank you very much

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,859
[Music]

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,859
[Applause]

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,930
thanks a lot Jeff yeah I hope you don't

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,760
mind we can take a few minutes for

00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,440
questions sure and we have can open up

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,870
to Chernobyl first we can talk about

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,150
that and then later we can talk about

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,770
open did anything so remember the mics

00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,570
are in the center here and if we need

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:09,770
handheld mics we could probably get a

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:12,950
handheld mic as well anyone like will

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,960
give a few seconds here and and maybe

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,850
I'll ask a question to give you guys

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,600
some time to get your courage up to go

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,770
to the mic we see a question why did

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,920
they hit this Graham button

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,750
I mean you spoiled it already so the

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,980
whole thing here but but how they get

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,300
there is really the fun part and I think

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,130
it's also the fun part of post-mortems

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,230
it's like it's like a detective mystery

00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,240
it's actually quite fascinating like how

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,100
did this happen like how did we get in

00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,960
this weird little scenario that we're in

00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,790
and just teasing out the details of how

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,140
that happened can be really fun right I

00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,360
think some of the best parts of software

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,890
engineering and that's so the fact that

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,210
I spoiled it isn't really a spoiler

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,160
right link you could look that up on

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,990
Wikipedia it's how they get there that's

00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,580
really fun I'm still gonna watch it ya

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:57,470
know it's gonna be great it's fantastic

00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:59,240
yeah so I thought it was really useful

00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,010
talking about failure like thanks

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,240
overall one of the things that I noticed

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,650
when you put up your list of

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,890
post-mortems is it looks like they were

00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,660
all outages and in many ways the things

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,400
you talked about is industry failures

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,740
like adding more engineers to a late

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,070
project don't necessarily cause outages

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:19,070
and so I'm curious what you do or any

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,960
advice you have on analyzing failures

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,850
that aren't outages and like what the

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,190
patterns you use for that are to learn

00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,960
lessons about organizational things

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,970
rather than just lessons about like

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,530
minute to minute incident response I

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,830
think that's a really good point and I

00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,330
think what it gets down to is honesty

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,100
like if you're dealing with engineers

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,020
that really want to fix the root problem

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,750
like the root problem Chernobyl was the

00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,970
Soviet state that's the real kicker to

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,100
the series is the Soviet state wasn't

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,770
equipped to build stuff like that like

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,000
in a way that was actually safe because

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,200
they were cutting too many corners and

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
doing it too cheaply the system was

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,680
basically broken so you would get to the

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,950
end of the five whys at chernobyl and be

00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,120
like the problem is the Soviet Union and

00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,370
you know the interesting thing is

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,690
Gorbachev specifically cited Chernobyl

00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,269
as one of the reasons for the

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,299
the breakup of the USSR was that that

00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:11,690
Illustrated they couldn't do things that

00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:13,849
other countries could you know so if you

00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,190
take that lesson and Transplant to the

00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,960
post mortem like the lesson could be the

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,179
reason we failed at this is we had too

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,129
many new people at work that hadn't been

00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,809
on boarded properly that didn't know

00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:26,269
process and procedure wasn't their fault

00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,470
they were trying really hard but we we

00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,950
took on people at the company too

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,529
quickly

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,450
we grew too fast like that could be an

00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,710
outcome from a post-mortem and you could

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,049
say look as a result we needed to

00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,970
onboard better slow down on onboarding

00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:40,099
or you know otherwise train people

00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,210
better before they're on the job I guess

00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,249
I'm just curious whether you've like

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,440
ever done a post-mortem for something

00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:47,809
like a schedule slip or a failed feature

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,950
alone oh yeah rather than for oh yeah no

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,049
but again I think that comes from again

00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,669
embracing failures like look we we're

00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:54,679
failing all the time right it's okay

00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:56,779
it's just we fix it right that's that's

00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,720
the magical part of this as we think

00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:01,489
about what we really need to do however

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,379
much it hurts right however whatever it

00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:04,279
says about what what did that say about

00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:06,109
the Soviet Union it was a very

00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:09,349
embarrassing lesson right our state

00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,639
doesn't work I mean that's so you could

00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,319
get to that level of honesty so I think

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,359
if you're dealing with managers and and

00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:15,799
and you know people in positions of

00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,020
power that are willing to be honest and

00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:19,279
actually want to fix the root problem

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,379
because why wouldn't you if it makes

00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:23,679
discourse the company better right to

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:26,210
acknowledge our weaknesses is a strength

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,250
so I think you have to have some honesty

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,200
from management for it to work but I

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,069
think it really can work thank you

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,230
you're welcome

00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,940
hey make sure that you introduce

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,980
yourself at the mic if you want to do a

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,960
good control just say real quick I'm

00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,879
Eric I'm an engineer at Sky dia which is

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,389
an autonomous drone company in right in

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,529
Redwood City

00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:46,789
thanks for question Eric thanks I

00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:49,520
excited Berg an engineer at Capital One

00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:51,260
I had a question you mentioned basically

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,230
success is boring you were at Stack

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,690
Overflow at some point you decided you

00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,029
wanted a challenge can you talk a little

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,309
bit about how you determine when you've

00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:04,460
hit the end and it's time to move on and

00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:06,470
pick a new challenge well my situation

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,510
there's a link I didn't really hit the

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,849
end of the road I basically had twins so

00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:14,119
when you have twins like everything

00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:16,610
changes and there were some other sort

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,110
of like stuff going on internally

00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:21,800
doesn't really matter but it was it was

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:24,230
not really you know for me personally it

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,670
was just it was time to move on to the

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,250
next project right like I done pretty

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,660
much all I needed to do there

00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,070
we established where the beachhead and

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,920
there's sort of different roles as the

00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,440
company grows that make more sense and

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,960
it was sort of a mutual decision but to

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,160
get to your broader question of like let

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,260
me clarify your question do you mean

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,820
like how do you decide you're done at a

00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,950
company or done with a project

00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:48,140
not at a company basically I think

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,990
whether you're on a project or a team oh

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,180
okay right things are going well okay so

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,770
what I call version 3.0 right like which

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,200
version three is kind of the magical

00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,090
version where when you start a project

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,350
you have this this glorious idea of like

00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,360
this thing we're gonna build it's gonna

00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:04,160
be amazing and v1 is gonna be terrible

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,940
right like it's just it's just gonna be

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,050
care but that's okay

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,700
you're gonna ship it it's gonna be

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,740
terrible but you're gonna fix it you're

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,090
gonna iterate write the name of the game

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,320
is iteration right how fast can i

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,630
iterate that's really everything

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,970
software is and iterate well

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,770
professionally I think when you feel

00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,120
like look this is a version 3.0 this is

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,830
kind of what I originally wanted to

00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,750
build mostly when you're at ninety

00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,760
percent of this is what I wanted when I

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,040
started then you're basically done

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,120
you're at version three like you can

00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,070
essentially give it over to someone else

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,810
that's where I felt like we were with

00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,570
Stack Overflow like I'd gotten all the

00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,130
key vision points in there was a bunch

00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,510
of tweaking I mean software is like

00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,900
gardening it's basically grow it

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,400
seasonally it doesn't really go away but

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,810
the fart the farm was there the farm was

00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,190
planted everything was good you could

00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,810
bring in other people to help harvest

00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,970
the crops and stuff so when you feel

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,860
like I'm 90% of version 3 and I feel

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,440
good about this that's the time of which

00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,890
it's okay in my opinion to to move on to

00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,890
the next thing

00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:02,750
thank you yeah you're welcome if anybody

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,040
needs a microphone if they want just

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,870
raise the hand and I'll come out I know

00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,130
it's hard to get in and around here I

00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,840
can also feel questions about Stack

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,640
Overflow if anyone has any Stack

00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,100
Overflow specific stuff how about

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,930
technical support questions I got a bill

00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,830
problem on basil well you know I have a

00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:21,550
Chromebook so everything just works yeah

00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,550
excellent excellent

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,930
any more more questions anybody all

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:31,370
right oh you have a question here I'll

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:36,170
give you this mic you have to walk all

00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:39,500
the way over there okay I'm Charles I've

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,480
just started joined the basil team what

00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,090
advice would you have given the Russian

00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,880
scientist when dealing with the Soviet

00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:49,460
state that didn't want to fix the

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,490
reactors or their system do you want

00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,760
more spoilers I've seen the show well

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,050
the answer was basically kill yourself I

00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,820
mean literally the guy killed himself

00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,140
and then they were like so shocked that

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,280
all the other scientists essentially

00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,870
forced them to do it

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,500
which is a very Russian way of solving

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,940
problems by the way if you're in a then

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,320
I killed myself and then then the

00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,000
product was saved that seems a little

00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,840
extreme it's really knowable Wednesday

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,510
night sorry is this on the table for you

00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:22,730
is this where you're telling me I'm just

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,980
the project must succeed at all costs

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,120
just in generally internalized that if

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,130
you're dealing with such a system above

00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,330
you that's not really helpful or

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:36,860
conducive to a lot of you know I let me

00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,360
let me in a more serious way address

00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,340
your point cuz I think it's a good one

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,140
when you're it's like how do you fix the

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,060
organization right because Google is a

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,340
huge company now right Lana it's

00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,170
difficult like I have some empathy for

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,610
companies I guess like it's just hard

00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,740
you get become so big you're like a

00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,110
nation-state like how do you manage

00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,150
America how do you manage you know

00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,980
France like it gets so big it's just

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,430
hard to reason about it's hard to

00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,680
understand and you might find yourself

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,840
facing the the problem like how do I

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,660
change the very organization that I'm a

00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:12,500
part of right and I think it takes

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:16,460
internal advocacy I think it takes you

00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:19,550
know really almost like I hate to say it

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,260
but like old-school blogging where

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,670
you're like look I believe in this I

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,670
want this thing to go forward I'm gonna

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,170
write like about how I think we should

00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,520
fix this right for example Chernobyl

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,010
like I think it would benefit every

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,900
citizen of the Soviet Union for us to

00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,220
fix the rbk reactors and in a way he did

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,450
blog he

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,020
to go back to Chernobyl which again I

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,730
love he went to the International

00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,770
inquiry about this right and kind of

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:45,080
told the truth mostly about what had

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,670
happened so the world saw like the

00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,070
problems with the rbk reactor he was

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,530
honest right so I think public honesty

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,820
is a good places and not from a place of

00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,260
I want to hurt people with this honest

00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,390
but honesty coming from a place of I

00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,250
just want this to be better I want

00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,460
everyone to benefit from these changes

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:03,140
and I really believe in this right it

00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,780
almost takes external advocacy to

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,980
sometimes get what you want depending on

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,810
how far you go but I think internal

00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,030
advocacy can also work if you have the

00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,500
right allies if you have a manager that

00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,609
gets it if you have a team that gets it

00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,849
if you have a PM that gets it if you

00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:20,090
have a VP that gets it right those are

00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:21,290
all very very good things so it can be

00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,730
tricky but I think it starts with

00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,470
internal advocacy and then you just ramp

00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,940
it up and make sure you're coming from a

00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,290
place of you know I'm not trying to

00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,450
manipulate the system I'm not trying to

00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:32,060
change the world I just want from a from

00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:34,910
a discipline of pure engineering of like

00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,230
what we can do in the world I want this

00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,700
to be better for everyone and people

00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,460
respect that right they see you're

00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,700
coming from a place of engineering you

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:48,410
know the first principles of engineering

00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:50,780
so yeah okay thank you yeah hi I'm Nick

00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:53,330
from Google I wanted to ask any

00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,089
spectacular or notable faders in your

00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:58,430
career and that you would like to tell

00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:00,980
us about our spectacular and horrible

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,920
failures in my career does this talk

00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:06,830
count I'm Justin Dobbs game this is a

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,300
good talk this is good sign now what I

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:13,940
like to talk about the big one for me

00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:16,400
was on Stack Overflow early on Stack

00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,570
Overflow is powered by you know software

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,920
developers all over the world right

00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,980
we're not the ones doing the work in the

00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,480
system they are so I always felt I had

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,670
to take very seriously the feedback I

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,670
was getting from the people using the

00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,619
system but I did not give them a place

00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,540
to go to give me that feedback that was

00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,430
structured I had sort of a Fight Club

00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,260
like attitude towards it where I was

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,000
like look you're on Stack Overflow but

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,560
don't talk about Stack Overflow on Stack

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,170
Overflow like don't talk about Fight

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,730
Club at Fight Club and we would always

00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,490
kick those questions out and that was a

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,599
huge mistake because the people that

00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,000
want to talk to you about how your

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,040
system

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,960
works are essentially your governance

00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,760
they're the people most interested in

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,710
like being your elected officials you

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,410
know they're they're wanting to help you

00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,420
maintain the system that you've built

00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,430
for everyone so there's some of your

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,050
best users there they're the source of

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,780
all leadership in the system and that

00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:09,240
was a huge mistake and I only realized

00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,680
it like a year or two years into the

00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,840
project that I was essentially kicking

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,460
out my best users like by telling them

00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,040
no don't talk about Stack Overflow

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,130
I was suppressing a huge an important

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,900
source of feedback for my project from

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,050
the very community that was driving the

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,750
project so yeah that was a big oversight

00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:29,340
and I kind of surprised myself with how

00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,810
how much I missed that one they

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,770
essentially for the way they forced me

00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,820
to do it is kind of funny they're like

00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,430
okay fine you don't want to do this

00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:40,260
we'll install PHP BB and then I was just

00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:42,750
like oh god Wow okay you have now forced

00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,540
my hand because I there cannot be more

00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:49,020
PHP in the world that is not a just and

00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,430
right world that I want to live in so

00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,630
yeah they kind of forced my hand on that

00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,940
but I'm glad they did because they were

00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,440
they were really right so I guess maybe

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,270
one of the adjunct lessons is sometimes

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,490
the community is right they may not be

00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,260
saying it in the right way but they're

00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,490
right about what they're saying you know

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:09,240
even if you don't wanna acknowledge it

00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:14,580
so yeah thanks for that question all

00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:16,290
right anything else okay cool thanks big

00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,860
round of applause for Jeff thank you

00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,860
thanks

00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:25,220
you may be you may be able to catch them

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,609
at the break afterwards and we'll go

00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,619
from there

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:30,400
okay okay thanks so much yeah thank you

00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:30,400
