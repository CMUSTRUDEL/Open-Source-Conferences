hi how are you I'm Chris skip all this

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,219
stuff so I run open source and public

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,860
sectors engineering for Google which

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,500
means i have a small portfolio of

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,500
government focused projects as well as

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,609
my open source work for the company the

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,430
agenda is very simple i'm going to

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:27,500
Yammer for a little bit and then you can

00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,430
have some questions this is a famous

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,830
criminal in the United States and then

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,420
and and then we'll go on from there so

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,620
first of all before I start about talk

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,739
about Google at all i wanted to talk

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,790
about open source itself we did a study

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,550
of how much code was out there and

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,309
available to you as a nation

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,719
individually within your companies to

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:55,899
use freely in in so many definitions of

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,969
the word free it's kind of scary but

00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:02,300
here's what's out there for you we have

00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:05,059
somewhere around 31 million unique files

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,860
containing program code that you can use

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:12,860
across approximately 2 billion lines of

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,840
code and and so what it comes down to

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,439
and the reason why I show this this

00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,930
slide is is that this is the equivalent

00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,560
of ten thousand engineers working for

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,180
six years straight this is a staggering

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,280
amount of productivity available to all

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,290
of us and it's one of the very real

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,049
reasons why Google was able to innovate

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,829
and come out of the gate so very

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:39,500
productively so very early on only by

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:41,900
2009 did we have 10,000 technology

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,570
people at Google Google's about half

00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,250
technology people engineering

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,390
informations and the rest and another

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,159
half everyone else so it was fairly

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,509
staggering to basically be able to

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,659
double the productivity of the company

00:01:53,509 --> 00:02:01,219
from the very first day was founded for

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,659
some definitions of double the real

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,700
question is why is all this code out

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,530
there and a lot of people have

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,450
postulated and written stories and

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,100
written books and and the rest about

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,510
this but we decided to actually ask

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,950
people in about ten years ago we asked

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,150
ten thousand developers on source for

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,069
we said hey why are you actually

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,739
released from source code and it was

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,790
actually a pretty amazing thing they

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,170
weren't doing it because they hated

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,730
microsoft store because they were

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,440
long-haired liberals from san francisco

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,910
although i am from mountain view which

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
is about 40 miles south it was because

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,330
they were interested in computer science

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,970
it was because they want to become

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,790
better using their computers at

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,120
administering their systems it was

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,160
because they wanted to sort of identify

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,410
with other people who wanted to stand on

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,200
the shoulders of programming giants as

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,700
it were and only eleven percent of them

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,709
didn't like Microsoft who didn't like

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,079
some company or some proprietary way of

00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,510
doing things and this was something I

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,870
identified with at the time because it

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,970
still because i never saw computer

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,099
science as being combative between large

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,769
companies are between countries or

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,959
between people who like this language of

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,599
that language whether spoken or

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,900
programmed i always saw computer science

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,970
is the way that we could do things you

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,310
know better and do things in an

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,109
interesting way and process information

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,959
and what i felt was a very compelling

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,310
way of life so this was a great thing

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,720
and this is why i've identified with

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,000
open sourcing but involved with since

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,870
1995 it's not other goes i'm just going

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,340
to skip this because we really don't

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,310
have a lot of time know how plan had to

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,769
cut into the break but let me continue

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:48,260
this is google you probably recognize it

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,220
this is google about 11 years ago they

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,940
basically walked up and down the

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,500
hallways of their lab there in stanford

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,019
and they found every computer that

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,670
wasn't plugged in they took it they

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,160
brought it to their lab and they plugged

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,150
it in and if people got upset they gave

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,220
the computer back so this is the last

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,769
time Google ran a heterogeneous network

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,829
of multiple operating systems you can

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:17,000
see here that we have IBM's sons but

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:19,099
mostly x86 machines running Linux we got

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,510
a little better in that we decided to

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:23,720
put everything in a trash can and mix it

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,400
up to make computers no not really for

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,530
those of you who are a computer

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,969
architects system administrators this

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,969
will look horrifying to you

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:35,449
and I apologize they'll be drinks later

00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:37,339
no so what you're looking at here is how

00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:43,729
much computer you could fit into a rack

00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:45,139
in in 1999 it was hot and any time you

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,629
break one computer you'd be breaking

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,599
four of them they feared power supplies

00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:52,369
there was a fabric of fans behind it and

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:54,679
whenever you would pull a computer out

00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:56,989
to work on it you would usually snap

00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:58,549
something off on those cables on the

00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:00,439
side so that was a bad design but it

00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,879
worked really well for us you can go see

00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,729
these at the computer history museum if

00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,739
here we're in the Silicon Valley the

00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:09,529
hard drives you see they're arresting on

00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:12,679
top of plexiglass on top of the memory

00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:14,199
sticks so but we were able to do a lot

00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:17,539
of computation very very quickly very

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,069
unreliably and that unreliability was

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,199
programmed around using open source

00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,169
software these machines were all running

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,969
Linux all the time and from then on we

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,360
were basically running Linux on

00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,829
everything and it would be Linux with

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,699
software those built using open source

00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,849
tools like GCC and Python and the rest

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,639
combining open source libraries and our

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,559
programming together to create google

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,669
this is as we as a couple of iterative

00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,229
pictures you can see our advanced

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,939
cooling system there in the bottom right

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,459
hand side of this of the screen there

00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:52,069
that fan has been at every data center

00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:53,269
I've ever been in and and I was very

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:56,149
happy when I got to be able to see that

00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,889
we had 12 at source Ford's this fan lit

00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,569
on fire and we had to bring the site

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,339
down for a little while but we won't go

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,719
there you can also see the advanced

00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,849
power distribution network that it's

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:08,629
cooling down using the power strips

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:11,089
hanging from the side there but then we

00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:14,179
got pretty good at things we we would

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:15,949
fill up a data center of this size in

00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:17,989
about two hours we would run Rock

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,909
machines and set them up and use up all

00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:22,009
the available power in that data center

00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:23,239
so we would often fill up a quarter of

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,329
the data center and use all the

00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:30,529
available power and AC and that didn't

00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:32,899
work so we went on to the more Minds

00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,899
where we have our own data centers our

00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,879
own machines are on everything so what's

00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,429
funny about all this is that to a great

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,480
degree the commodification of computer

00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:44,340
components for desktop machines

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,710
and to a much lesser degree server

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,540
machines is what fueled Google we always

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,010
use desktop components we always use

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,450
desktop asics and all the rest to drive

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,650
our machinery and the reason for that is

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,480
because we could get the best prices for

00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,280
them and thus get the most power out of

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,350
them and we were very much dependent

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,690
upon the raw computing power and the raw

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,130
storage that the internet and scanning

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,170
it and indexing and searching it

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,510
requires and then we were to run linux

00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:13,170
on top and derive all of our sort of

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,900
reliability in the software layer so

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,290
that's google google is you know our own

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,030
racks running pc class other boards and

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,160
you know really big flippin hard drives

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,690
you know and then we wrote our software

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
on top of Linux and it's been working

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,910
really well for us going on 10 plus

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,540
years 10 so I talked about that kind of

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,800
oh why why so I'm going to tell you a

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,210
story about another company to tell you

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,610
a story about Google back in 2004 france

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,650
telecom wanted to bring out push-to-talk

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,390
capability on their cellphone network

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,580
push-to-talk is when you hit the button

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,170
it goes dude it's really loud it's often

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,270
used in construction sites so it acts

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,140
more was a walkie talkie than it does is

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,820
it cell phone I'm sure you're all

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,330
familiar with him and if not I've just

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,710
described it they want you to play this

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,690
date a two year plan they spent two

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,450
billion dollars upgrading their carrier

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,010
infrastructure very expensive hardware

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,950
and an enormous rocks machinery to make

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,320
it work and they inspect out a cell

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,110
phone to take advantage of this new

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,340
feature i was running windows mobile and

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,350
this is actually not an anti windows

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,820
talk i'm not that kind of person it's a

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:23,570
what happens when someone else controls

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:25,680
your destiny talk and so which i think

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,140
when a country decides it wants to be

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,800
serious about about computer technology

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:35,130
this resonates so they had a problem

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,050
where every fifth call would die it

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,320
wouldn't go through it would fail and

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,419
often the phone would need a reboot and

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,770
it's they couldn't get past it and they

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,480
finally tracked down the heir to a

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,250
shared library in the operating system

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,990
they contacted their customer

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,490
representative and they said hey we

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,420
found this problem they're like hey we

00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,000
found it to like reach we'd like to fix

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,800
it

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,840
he said we have fixed it they're like

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,230
awesome this is a fantastic you know

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,170
this is terrific and they go can we have

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,190
the fix no you can't have the fix and

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,240
they're like well why not they're like

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,860
it's in the next version the operating

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,620
system okay we'll take the next version

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,070
of the operating system okay it'll be

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,920
ready in 18 months and they're like but

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,800
we ship in three months and they're like

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,260
we're sorry we can't help you now this

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,660
is not unreasonable for Microsoft to do

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,220
they did a very specific kind of math

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,130
that you do in computer companies where

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,380
you say this you say how much money do I

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,290
make from this and is it worth the extra

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,410
cost of having a special version of the

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,240
operating system and if the scales

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,210
balance one way or another you have in

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,470
your answer in the case of France

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,660
Telecom there were two and a half

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,460
percent of windows mobile revenue and

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,230
the cost to have a special cut of the

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,360
operating system gesture France Telecom

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,220
for that time period was determined to

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,640
be too high to give them access to the

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,840
code now if it had been Linux I could

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,300
have done what we had been doing all

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,950
along just change it and push it out and

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,600
you know what maybe the Linux kernel

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,339
team will take your patches and maybe

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,810
they won't but you'll be able to control

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,550
your destiny and that was a very very

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,870
important thing to google and it's

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,910
something that our employees and our

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,130
engineers and our founders we're used to

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,920
doing here's open source software we can

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,250
do if it what we wish and make Google

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,900
better and you know what that's a funny

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,600
thing I could have stopped my talk to

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,060
there and maybe for the sake of time I

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,030
should but I still have a little bit of

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,260
time left so we keep going you can stop

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,050
right there and say you know what I am a

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,510
very good of open source software and

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,550
free software I know how to use it to

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,700
make my life more productive my computer

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,250
scientists happier my engineers more

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,200
useful and that's a pretty terrific

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,430
thing coo ten thousand engineers in your

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,450
pocket literally in the case of android

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,330
but we wanted to go a little bit further

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,950
since we recognized how important open

00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,050
source was to ask but more importantly

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,290
to the future of the internet the future

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,610
of a fair and which you cannot have

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,740
without korean open source software

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,250
implementing the standards that Mitchell

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,570
enjoy talked about

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,140
we decided that we want to do some other

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,760
things so we took three broad tax

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,529
supporting open source infrastructure we

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,550
host over 300,000 projects on code

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:26,230
google com now we also help fund the

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,290
open-source labs which hosts groups like

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,149
Mozilla and others we release open

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,820
source code ourselves which I've always

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,940
thought is the real coin of the realm

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,589
when it comes to open source software

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,600
developers we've released a little over

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,339
nine hundred projects to date those are

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,709
smaller projects usually between 20 and

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,570
a hundred thousand lines of code for a

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,459
total of about 18 million lines of code

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,980
into the world of open-source software

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:53,560
it is not a liar or hyperbole to engage

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,700
in to say that every single one of you

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,500
is running some code that we have

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,660
released from google even if you're

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,880
running an apple iphone or a Macintosh

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,800
or a windows machine or Windows Mobile

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,390
you not to be running Android or any

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,130
specific Google technology to have been

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,620
taking the advantage of the work we've

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:13,300
done and that's something I'm actually

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:14,769
quite proud about we've patched into

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,930
literally every project you can imagine

00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:19,120
so we lost track we decided actually to

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,310
stop tracking patches directly it was

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,339
just everywhere we did a survey about

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,740
two years about a year ago and we found

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,350
over 87,000 patches had been done by

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,730
Google that we could find and that was

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,040
just the ones with the at Google address

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,680
and then we've released huge and major

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,149
projects like chrome and being the

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,230
open-source part of that and android

00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:45,640
android is now shipping a little over

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,079
250,000 units a day so I think I want to

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,790
wrap up with before I go to questions

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,510
assuming you have any you know I'm sure

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,480
I've covered everything is web m and web

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,430
p so web M we purchased a company by the

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,829
name of on technologies and they have a

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:03,370
very very innovative and effective and

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:06,459
modern video codec that they've put

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:10,750
together we released it under a patent

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:12,130
granting version of a bsd license we're

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,120
basically we have the bsd license and

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,459
then a patent ground on the side that

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,380
says here take it if we haven't have any

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:19,270
patents covering this you're cool you

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,529
don't have to pay us for that because we

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
want people to adopt this very very

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,430
quick

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,510
we feel the state of video codecs is

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:29,120
such that the costs incurred by video

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,250
sites encoders and software is too high

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,360
and so we released this we think this is

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,810
probably the most important things we've

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,500
released in the last five years and web

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:42,589
p is the single picture version of that

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,000
they're efficient and and truly free

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:48,050
codex which is something we haven't had

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,910
ever you don't know this but I'm sure

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,880
many I could raise your hands if you

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,010
have a phone or a HD camera in your

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,440
possession today we'll make it easy it's

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,360
not even necessary so every single one

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,640
of those is licensed by MPEG LA for

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,160
non-commercial use only non professional

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,260
used to so if you consider yourself a

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,670
commercial or professional person you

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,940
probably don't have the right camera for

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,230
it may be that guy in back at the tripod

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,720
he had a patty paid probably three times

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,950
as much first camera though and its

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,130
restrictions like that that you don't

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,779
even think about but you're breaking

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,330
that license every time you post it

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,750
online and that's something we wanted to

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:30,589
see the end of so yeah I think that's

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,330
basically oh that I went into I took off

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,800
a whole bunch of slides about vba

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,490
acceptor you didn't want to see

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,720
signal-to-noise graphs in the rest I'll

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,520
wrap up with in case there's any

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,560
students in the room we have a yearly

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,620
program called the Summer of Code this

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,120
year we had a thousand just a little

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,650
over a thousand so I usually pick a

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,790
prime number over a thousand I know

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:55,580
that's really nerdy but and they worked

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,110
for over 150 organizations across open

00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,540
source software there were over 2,000

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,890
mentors looking after them and and

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,959
they're paid five thousand dollars if

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,350
they succeed and we have an eighty-one

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,160
percent pass rate across 94 countries

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,810
generates about three million lines of

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,040
code a year now we've regenerated about

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,959
13 million lines of code through this

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,880
program and this is separate from the

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,589
other code that we've released this is

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,240
our way of bringing new developers into

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,070
the world of open source and these

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,950
developers got have gone on to both work

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,810
on projects like Mozilla and the rest

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,040
but also to become active members of

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,089
open source communities all over the

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,270
world so there you go and now I'm happy

00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:43,040
to take any questions you might have

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:45,310
I know well okay now you'll need a

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,960
microphone there's microphone people I

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,690
hear they're over there and there's

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:58,910
people over here he's running up it's

00:15:50,690 --> 00:16:02,630
very exciting I assure you so so thank

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:05,210
you very much for that anytime you know

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,910
one thing I google I think they've been

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,070
revolutionizing the way you know they're

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,720
neutralizing the playing field across

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,370
the internet I mean open it's not just

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,620
into technology but your information I

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,140
mean seeing every single day you have

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,070
google labs something new comes out

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,420
experiment tinker with it I mean those

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,940
are your things but I mean have you ever

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,120
been thought about like opening labs up

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,080
even more to people around the world I

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,450
mean even though that's started by

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,860
Google's using your maybe Google 20

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:39,260
principle so we have we we've had some

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:45,230
very weird ideas that didn't pan out as

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:47,450
well as we wanted them to so the way we

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,490
approach that the way we we take our

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,500
data systems on our and our machinery

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,870
and our programs we try to open them up

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,730
the api's and sometimes we're successful

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,440
like the the google maps api is very

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,090
successful and sometimes were not i

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,640
think people aren't really clear as to

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,980
how the whole Docs and spreadsheets API

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,540
can be used and is effective for them so

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,660
this is in a lot of ways at evolving

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,910
place for google you know one of the

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,270
things that we looked on with just like

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:17,330
glorious envy and admiration was like

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,290
the netflix contests i don't know if any

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,420
of you are familiar with this netflix

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,640
released a lot of data and they had a

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,190
contest with with an amazing monetary

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,589
prize if you could improve their

00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,960
algorithm for matching and recommending

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,520
new movies this is something that we

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,770
considered doing we've always hit the

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,020
full on privacy because it's extremely

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,520
difficult to release search data without

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,290
releasing lots of very personal

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,920
information as AOL found out back in

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,900
2006 and as Netflix found out because I

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,280
had to cancel their second

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,680
because there was too much personal data

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,600
in just the way that people looked for

00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,660
movies it was astonishing a research

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,760
group was able to match up the movie

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,310
search with the human being almost

00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,510
immediately so so ya know we think about

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,820
this all the time and we express it

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,260
through api's more often than not and if

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,370
you have any ideas for new IP is that

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,510
you want to see i'd love to hear about

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:11,080
them so finding at the break i guess

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:12,280
yeah we have someone up here I think

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,650
there's someone back there too yeah it's

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,640
like the lights work against you you

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:21,180
know but he'll be next yeah yeah first I

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,430
was attending the Java 21 birthday

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,160
conference in and Google was one of the

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:32,530
sponsors for hydrolysis but actually I

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:35,710
am I want more Club more investment from

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,600
bogan in the region and there is no

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,270
right yeah there is no development

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,280
center for Google in any European

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:48,070
country ok I am I'm like a like to have

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,800
one of these development centers in

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,120
rypien country the newest one is I think

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,880
in Turkish there's solution Center for

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,310
development for google but and also

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,440
there is I have friends working in

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,750
google in arabic arabic but they are

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,690
working from Switzerland so why you

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,590
doing here yes sir why why Google didn't

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,400
open any development center in libyan

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,870
country we're pretty clueless sometimes

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,700
you know it's hard to figure out where

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,460
to open up new engineering centers is a

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,080
lot but one of the things we're doing is

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,190
we're having google developer days in

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,380
egypt jordan in november sorry in early

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,960
December and I see that as sort of like

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,530
a Google getting its head together as to

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,000
where these developers are Surak is easy

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,490
for us because we could pull a lot of

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,310
the European nation developers to Zurich

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,510
and the London and to a lesser degree to

00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:48,280
Ireland although we have a huge

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:50,290
footprint in Ireland honestly we're just

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,810
not not that sharp about the Middle East

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,310
sometimes either you know we we have a

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,010
lot to learn about the region and we

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,990
have we have an office of now in Dubai

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,840
as well as in Saudi or I think in Saudi

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,760
Arabia it's slightly repairs tomorrow

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,800
but ya know we and those are more than

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,600
just sales offices there also sort of

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,460
like cultural touchpoints so we can

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,040
learn more about the region and come to

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,350
understand where the developers are you

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,570
know so doha can make a huge step

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,810
forward by just getting those kids from

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,860
CMU and VCU and the rest and and get a

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,730
packing all is I didn't see any

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,770
graduates herself but yeah you know it's

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,510
like we you know did the other side of

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,520
this is their developers everywhere and

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,960
you always do that math can you bring

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,150
them to you or you have to go to them

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,950
what keeps people where they are you

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,830
know it's how we ended up in Australia

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,840
actually we so wanted Lars and the only

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,040
way he would stick come to Google's if

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,270
we were there and so we had to open a

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,470
place that the same same was true with

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,600
Craig Neville Manning in New York City

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,160
so but but we haven't opened up

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,110
something in new york in new zealand for

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,730
Craig animal Manning's so you have to do

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,090
the math all the time but yeah we think

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,940
about it all the time hey Chris hi how

00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,160
you doing swap okay thanks to you for

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,040
being here I'm going to run a little bit

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,480
here it can you hear me yeah I can't

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,670
look a great weight I couldn't see you

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,070
that's right okay basically okay it's

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,110
great to have you here and we've all

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,090
been encouraged and we've all been

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,490
talking about openness and how it makes

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,650
sense in a conceptual faction and more

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,320
philosophically and based on this

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,360
production values and develop it keeping

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,870
this in mind I would like to talk about

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,870
Google's open android platform okay hang

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,750
on okay first of all hey Wally google is

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,090
legally called legally dame in android

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,920
to be an open mobile operating system

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,400
because it gives out the source code

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,610
however i think it fails in to get you

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,610
know dealing with you know the more

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,230
moral values of openness which is more

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,410
of a contribution of effort and

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,810
development effort from consumers yeah

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,120
so in that case it's for example it's

00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,730
not being updated to users all our new

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,130
features and what was that one say that

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,550
one more time basically all the new

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,110
versions of android is not always

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,600
released because of the contribution

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,280
from users right that's that's one thing

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,630
and i am

00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,370
not saying this personally I'm saying is

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,770
wrong that's okay you know people and I

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,590
can use that as well as yeah make sense

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:19,590
okay I've got a second second point in a

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:23,070
question to make which is carriers it

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,930
seems carriers are always hurting the

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,810
openness of Android even if there is an

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:31,890
openness in Android very right so I want

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,590
you to comment on that and also thirdly

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,840
and lastly comment on other true opening

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,710
or open operating systems such as the

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,300
symbian foundation um so simians working

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,560
on opening up their code as fast as they

00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,890
can and they actually opened up a huge

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,110
repository of software so that was great

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,990
it was under the EPL i believe they

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,000
chose which makes it even harder for

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,860
carriers to adopt it it's funny because

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,430
the things that you want from the

00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,890
openness side of things can be very very

00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,570
hard when it comes to getting carriers

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,750
to actually stop the operating system

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:09,420
and ship it so we try to do this balance

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,240
where we have carriers and handset

00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,290
manufacturers chipset developers

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,910
software developers themselves running

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,220
applications on top of the platform and

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:21,780
trying to get them all the information

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,820
they need to ship phones and it's a

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,420
balance and we're we're we haven't

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,710
pleased everyone during this time I've

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,620
been happy and that we've released the

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,850
code Prairie version to the outside

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,980
world and people can able to make

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:37,830
devices from that and they've been able

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,240
to make them using Bing or using our

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,770
competitors so that shows you in a lot

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,050
of ways what Mitchell said about forking

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,010
and about having people do with your

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,540
operating system maybe what you're not

00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,970
thrilled about and that's when you know

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,290
it's really open source but a lot of

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,530
people want more than that they want us

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:55,920
to take more user input and that's

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:58,710
historically logged jbq who's on our

00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,990
open source team in the android group

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:04,920
has done a fantastic job of bringing

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,660
user patches but it's just it's one of

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,060
those things where over time they might

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,260
converge a little better it's a lot

00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,000
better now than it was two years ago

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,800
when we first release a software code

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,920
and I think it'll keep on getting better

00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,410
I don't see carriers as the enemy though

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,340
a lot of people like to say the carrier

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,140
stink for doing explains

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,510
the carriers have a huge investment in

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,790
infrastructure and they're the ones

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,800
selling the phones and having to support

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,450
them so they'll often do things that

00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,380
maybe I don't agree with philosophically

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:39,980
but the overall trend is towards more

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,470
openness over time and I'm patient so I

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,030
would say what is Q tell doing can we

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,140
get them to use Android and of course

00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,700
you know the answer to that is we have

00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,430
to have better Arabic language support

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,200
and that's something we're working on so

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,730
and I think I answered most of your

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,940
questions but i'm bad at remembering

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,950
multiple questions at a time and then do

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,350
you have anything going on here do I

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,000
have to shut up yeah I have to show up

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,500
now so you can have a break or something

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,490
Brian's going to come up here and tell

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,490
