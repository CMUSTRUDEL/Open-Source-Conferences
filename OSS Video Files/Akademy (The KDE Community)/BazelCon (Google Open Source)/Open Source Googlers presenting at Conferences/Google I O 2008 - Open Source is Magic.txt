Title: Google I O 2008 - Open Source is Magic
Publication date: 2010-12-17
Playlist: Open Source Googlers presenting at Conferences
Description: 
	Open Source is Magic
Chris DiBona (Google)

Google Open Source Programs Manager Chris DiBona will discuss how, in fact, Open Source is too good to be true and thus must be magic. He will talk about how open source came into being, what it is, what it is not, and how Google uses it to write its software, release software to you and maybe make life a little more magical for you, too.

this is actually kind of a gossipy thing

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,130
this is entertainment you're not gonna

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,600
learn a lot I don't even learn about

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,950
some history and stuff but it's not like

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,480
you're gonna walk away saying I'm gonna

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,780
go create the next Google App Engine

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,309
thing so so I want to make sure your

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,859
your expectations are in the right place

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,230
here they've asked me to mention that my

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,050
my compatriot brian fitzpatrick and ben

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,210
collins-sussman will be giving a talk on

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,650
Thursday at 2 o'clock about how your

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,359
open source project can survive

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,580
poisonous people

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,630
I believe my picture is up somewhere in

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,880
there no no I'm kidding

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,079
and then at 12:45 on the same day

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,030
they're gonna talk about how we do open

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,500
source project hosting so they're

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,790
they're really the authorities on that

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,840
so if you want to ask me questions about

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,829
that you're wasting your time because

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm gonna be like Fitz you know so

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,020
that's good do you guys want a Q&A

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,180
because I can always expand my speech to

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,079
have less you're saying no but no Q&A is

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,969
cool because a lot of people have

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,050
questions about how I'm gonna give like

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:03,539
a 5-10 minute thing at the end for Q&A

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:05,760
so hi this is my talk so I had this

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,130
stump speech they gave for the last four

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,590
years called Google and open source and

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,670
and I've given it a zillion times and I

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,619
have to be honest with you I was like

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,960
getting kind of tired of it so I tried

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,189
out this other thing and it was a three

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,790
hour long history of open source

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,280
software and and wow that's a good

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,320
speech it's quite long and I've given

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,369
that in 45 minutes but it requires me to

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,560
be really over caffeinated and and it's

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,420
a good talk but then it feels a little

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,790
too tight right and so we didn't want

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,930
that so so I said well why don't what if

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,119
I brought them together what if I said

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,979
okay give you sort of an idea of sort of

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,780
where one source has been the kinds of

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,710
things that that I've been asked for the

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,310
last 12 years of doing this

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,750
professionally and and then bring it up

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,909
to sort of where we are at Google and

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,100
how we appreciate open source and and

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,649
and how we release open source software

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,180
and how we feel about it so this is the

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,590
results of that experiment I've given

00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,729
this a couple of times we're still

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,149
working it out but it but it's very very

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,640
simple I use the word magic which of

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,439
course brings to mind Doug Henning so

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,940
the difference between Doug and I'm Doug

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,290
is skinny skinny er felt there and I I

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,620
wear glasses

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,180
and yeah it's funny because when I when

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,469
I first gave this I looked up Doug

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,790
on Wikipedia cuz that's the first thing

00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:24,500
you do before you put up a picture of a

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:28,260
famous scary magician and it turns out

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,939
he's one of these yogic fliers he can

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,129
sit there and flex his legs and bounce

00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,829
so he's one of these guys but he's also

00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,540
dead he died of cancer in 2000 so so

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:41,159
it's really an upbeat way to begin a

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,019
talk so Who am I really I

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm the open source programs manager for

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,909
Mountain View California based Google a

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,040
internet company what that means is that

00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,989
I'm tasked with managing compliance with

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,220
open source licenses which is quite

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,409
challenging in a company that has as

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,409
many engineers as we do whenever we

00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,120
release code everyone here today

00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,220
speaking is talking about code that

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,510
we've released and so our job is to make

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,819
sure it's got the right licenses that

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,409
it's you know properly you know

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,629
templated and boiler plated and all

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,189
these things that seem maybe a little

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,659
minor but are really really important

00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,540
from a philosophical point of view to me

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,549
and we run the Summer of Code and we

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,049
provide some insight into when api's are

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:22,859
a launch that we do so in such a way

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,419
that's you know fair right so a lot of

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,209
people don't think about this but when

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,919
you consume an API you know you're

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,750
basically entering into a funny kind of

00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,579
agreement with the company whose API

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,650
you're consuming you're saying wow I'm

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,900
trusting you to provide this API for

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,129
awhile and and if you're not going to

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,319
provide it that you'll do certain things

00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,879
and maybe I can move by my service to

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,129
another provider you know is that

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,139
possible and so we try to take a lot of

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,909
the doubt out of the equation we try to

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,379
make it a little more honest so for

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,790
instance you'll see things like non

00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,590
asserts coming out of Google you'll see

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,849
that we've joined the open invention

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,620
Network you'll see these kinds of things

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,510
and the whole point of that is to say to

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,639
you the developer exactly what we're

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,250
doing when we create an API so you can

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,590
understand what sort of company you're

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,079
dealing with and and we try to do it

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,540
well I'll talk about this much later and

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,189
I don't want to give up like a slide in

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,269
the beginning you know cuz you would

00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:16,169
hate to miss a really good slide right

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,259
although you're in this talks you're

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,359
giving a lot of really good slides here

00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,760
it's latched on podcasting blah blah

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,850
blah blah blah it was funny I was

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,160
looking for a picture that was

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:33,590
see pants on iStockphoto for the last

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,880
one because I was like look at me if you

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,010
know my educational background you'll

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,660
see why that's funny but I don't go into

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:44,120
that yeah and I really suffer it's fun

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,400
to do so our agenda today is very very

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,290
simple me questions that's it he's

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,670
actually been indicted for selling those

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,470
make money off the government for no

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,000
money down kind of books late at night I

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,650
actually don't think he's been indicted

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,810
but it you know when you type in

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,190
question guy and Google this is what you

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,940
find and that's exactly what I was

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,940
looking for me

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,200
you know most geeks how many of you have

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,150
seen this this quote before but actually

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,560
who hasn't seen this quote before so

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,870
yeah you've all seen this quote and

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,730
that's why since open source does

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,830
something a little unusual and that it

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,050
gives you all this functionality and all

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,120
this beauty through technology it's

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,430
magic right it does things that don't

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,200
make any sense and that's what I want to

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,120
talk about but what is open-source right

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,950
and a lot of you are saying I already

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,750
know this dude but remember this is

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:37,910
about me talking to you so very simply

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,680
open source is software that is licensed

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,440
by an open source initiative license

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,030
right very very simple this is this is

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,780
the core idea that's what open source

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,520
says right and and well most the time so

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,540
there's there's a how many licenses does

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,060
always I have right now

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,350
61 yeah so 61 licenses have been

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,930
confirmed by the open source initiative

00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,090
as being consistent with the open source

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,410
definition well the problem with that is

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,970
you've got eight licenses that cover

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,620
99.99999% of the code out there and then

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,190
you've got these onesie twosie projects

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,360
right and so when we think about open

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,680
source of Google and the way I

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,190
personally feel about open source is

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,680
that you should concentrate on those big

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:25,730
communities of software right the GPL

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:28,460
the LGPL is the the the the LGPL is the

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:31,040
LGPL is the bsd the LGPL is the apache

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,690
the LG pls and you know you bring them

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,669
all together and and that's gonna be

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,740
your big majority case right the MIT

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,240
license is a good example right and and

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,410
then you know when you start looking at

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,690
the smaller communities

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,820
and I don't mean this is as a disc which

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,920
is what the hip kids say today I don't

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,880
mean as a disrespect like for instance

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,860
the EPL but there are that's a very

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,390
popular license but within one community

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,640
within the Eclipse community which is

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,050
very important but I wouldn't release a

00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,880
piece of software unless it was part of

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,530
Eclipse under that license and they

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,330
actually the company Google you know

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,710
we've released things under the EPL

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,030
because it was part of Eclipse but

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,700
otherwise we'd never use the license

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,110
right so it's a little bit of insight in

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,180
how we think about these licenses what

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,130
isn't open source so this on community

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,650
source license is an open source public

00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,650
domain can sort of kind of be open

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,150
source but sometimes it's not and that's

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,860
that's really unusual right because

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,990
you're like wait a second we can use it

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,800
what are you talking about are you high

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm not I don't indulge in that kind of

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,980
thing okay

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,120
so public domain let's talk about that

00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,500
there are some people who can really

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,970
spoke to main software and in fact there

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,400
are some organizations that can only

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,510
release public domain software there are

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,410
parts of the US government for instance

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,390
who cannot apply copyright they do not

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,700
have copyrighted it belongs to the

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,950
people if you're a US citizen it belongs

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,270
to you belongs to all of us and for us

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,670
to do whatever we wish with this

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,630
software I actually cannot put a license

00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,970
on it right there are a lot of

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,500
organizations in the government like

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,700
this and so they released this plug

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,780
domain and we actually trust them when

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,540
they say this is being released as

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,770
public domain however other

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,080
organizations other governments maybe in

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,370
countries for instance that subscribe to

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,020
the World Intellectual Property

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,460
Organization z-- moral rights standards

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,040
that means that for instance if denise

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,800
is to create some piece of art and Simon

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,220
is to buy it and then I don't know what

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,710
your name is

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,300
I call you Tom hi Tom and and Tom should

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,770
buy it from Simon for ten times the

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,080
price he actually owes some money to

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,220
Denis as part of that transaction and it

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,800
was meant to protect sculptors and

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,039
painters and artists but actually had

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,520
these very significant impacts on

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,800
intellectual property in general

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,960
including software so in some countries

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,789
you actually can't release things under

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,280
public domain you think you can be you

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,050
can't so and also we think it's a kind

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,190
of a bad idea to encourage pony release

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,320
because it actually doesn't protect the

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,640
people who are releasing software by

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,520
giving the proper kinds of

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,560
guarantees or lack thereof anyway and

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,300
really from my abilities that most even

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,610
incredibly unencumbered open-source

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,800
licenses give so these aren't open

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,380
source and and it's and and they're not

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,540
open source in some countries but even

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,670
in countries that allow public domain

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,830
code it's actually really bad for the

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,570
people who are releasing the software so

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,310
when we've been presented with public we

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,780
encode at Google we actually go back to

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,090
the people we say listen can we actually

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,610
get one under a more restrictive license

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,100
which a BSD and MIT and in fact you in

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:29,090
compared to both domain is and they're

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,400
like sure weirdo or they say no and we

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:35,360
just deal with it and we say okay your

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,860
funeral you know but you know it's

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,140
actually not open source

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,310
similarly one of the things I keep in

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,050
the back of my head whenever somebody's

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,460
talking to me about open source but I

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,770
know they have a profit motive going on

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,110
it's not the profits bad but when they

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,790
start saying these control words right

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,740
when they start saying things like well

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,620
you know we charge by the CPU for that

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,360
or we charge by the access license the

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,410
client license you know I'm thinking

00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,420
that's not open source anymore even

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,010
though I could tell you all kinds of

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,770
ways of taking any open source license

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,440
and wrapping it in such a way and some

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,560
mechanism some other way of controlling

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,530
intellectual property and charging you

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,850
whatever I want but the reality is once

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,780
you start hearing words like that you

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,010
should think to yourself you know that's

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,360
probably not open source it doesn't mean

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,370
it's bad just means it's probably not

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,750
open source and you probably shouldn't

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,280
put it in the same part of your head as

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:27,110
real open source so the magical origins

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,390
of open source software this is as far

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,610
as I can find the earliest example of

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,970
where open source came from so on the

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:38,090
right you see you know the origins of

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,820
Unix right so Ken Thompson Ken Thompson

00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:43,490
to Google which is awesome Dennis

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,760
Ritchie pounding away implementing UNIX

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,940
and C on their on their mainframe they

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,860
gave a talk at Purdue in 1971 the year

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,490
of my birth to the fellow on the Left

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,340
Kirk McKusick

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,420
and he was in the audience and he's

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,790
watching them talk about this

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,800
implementation of Unix on the mainframe

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,410
using this very portable language see

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,450
and he was just enthralled he said wow I

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,290
could take this information I could take

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,060
this code even maybe

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,970
but I could take this information and I

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,529
could build eunuchs and I could spread

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,180
it around and I can get people

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,810
developing in this manner this is very

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,579
exciting

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,259
and it was exciting it was really cool

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:19,759
cuz he went I met JD Berkeley as you

00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,350
know and this is where the Berkeley's

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,069
system distribution came from which

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,750
became the genesis for not just you know

00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,759
companies like Sun and Apollo at the

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,720
time and others but also was the genesis

00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:34,310
of what became a movement that inspired

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
literally tens of thousands of

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,029
programmers won hundreds of thousands of

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,759
programmers all around the world to work

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,769
on these BSD related tools and all the

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,690
rest and so this was incredibly exciting

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,000
and and of course it wasn't a hundred

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,290
thousand in 1971 but you know you have

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,630
to get your start somewhere so this is

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,699
an important story

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,560
similarly in 1984 you're laughing

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:58,639
because this is Richard Solomon in Lego

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,990
form it's funny the lawyers are like do

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:06,649
you have a license for that image I'm

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:08,480
like you know the guy on the right is

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:10,730
actually just as important though I want

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:16,940
to explain why so that this well not a

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,709
gala the printer right sorry so the

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,170
printer is an important printer this is

00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:25,339
the the first Xerox laser printer that

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:28,279
was delivered to the MIT AI lab right

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,540
overseas sale now this is printer is

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,420
important because it teaches a lot of

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,889
lessons right the most important lesson

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,600
is the one that it taught Richard but

00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,010
there's another lesson I want to explain

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,990
about standards and why you should pay

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,269
attention to standards even ones that

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,399
get no news or no name so this printer

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:44,959
was a remarkable printer it would print

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,970
out you're like why is he telling me

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,250
about a printer this printer would print

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,589
out two pages every second that's

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,149
remarkably fast right we're talking

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,769
about the early 80s right now we're not

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,029
talking about something you get free

00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,209
with your MacBook when you order it from

00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,819
Apple okay this is a significant machine

00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:04,220
embedded inside it is a pdp-11 computer

00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:06,110
right and this was expensive this is a

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:12,920
big printer it says you know not the

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:13,880
width it's big and and when they were

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,160
building it out they were like wow you

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,680
know with this laser we could deliver

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,069
360 dots per inch it's never been done

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,610
before

00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:21,470
and

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,510
is up really well with how printing in

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,370
the large presses is done that's what we

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,560
should do engineers came back and said

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,750
no no no if we do that it's going to

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,610
cost us much extra in terms of ram and

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,839
memory they're like well what what do we

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,310
have to dial it down to so that we can

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,200
do our two pages per second they said

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,760
well if we dial it back to 300 you know

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,709
that'll work and so now when you buy a

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,820
printer it's always in measures of 300

00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:48,920
300 600 1200 2400 4800 dots burn and

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,630
it's because of that printer that math

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,300
came from that printer and because

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,380
memory was just that much more expensive

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,300
and what's funny about it is that same

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,279
memory problem because they dialed it

00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,519
back right they actually didn't do it

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,040
right

00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,390
they had a screwed-up buffer and so when

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,399
the fellow on the left leg Oh figured

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,519
there decided to print to it if he

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,410
printed three pages that gal or her

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,790
maintenance equivalent whoever was

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,610
working a deck at the time would have to

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,230
come tear apart the computer rebuild it

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,510
because it would get jammed up and so

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,310
Richard scratched his head he said well

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,829
what if we just and it reduces the delay

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,360
after every second page just a little

00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,279
bit so that it could dump out that page

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,500
free up the buffer and then we can

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,790
refill it with more pages and that fixed

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,410
the problem then he went to Xerox he

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,750
said I fixed your problem I said that's

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,699
great and he said I'd like to give you

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,570
the patch and they said fantastic and

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:40,220
they said sign here he said why they

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,720
said well we want to take your patch but

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,310
we can't take it also becomes our

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,079
intellectual property and he said what I

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,220
don't want to give that to you they're

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,390
like but how else are we gonna give it

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,970
to our customers it's like I've already

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,370
given it to your customers and they're

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,820
like what and they were verklempt you

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,440
know and and and and and they were very

00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,180
upset and he was very upset and so he

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,620
logically decided the only answer to

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,390
this was to create an entire free

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,070
operating system so that all of us can

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,170
have freedom to do whatever we want with

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,640
our hardware and this is a very

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,540
important lesson now that might seem a

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,980
little extreme you know like wow huh an

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,570
ultra property greement I'll create my

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,209
own Unix but you know whatever

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,130
alright and he wanted one that had

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,620
certain aspects that the BSD didn't have

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,540
right so so he said okay well my

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,060
reaction to this is I'm gonna make a

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,170
world where everyone is free to do

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,449
whatever they want with their hardware

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,970
and that was his original motivation and

00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,950
it informs every action of the Free

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,870
Software Foundation did

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:38,230
up to and including the debates around

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,580
gplv3 so very important thing so we're

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,320
gonna fast forward 15 years now like I

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,330
said not gonna do all the interim steps

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,320
you know then the internet happened and

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,450
and it was funny because as the internet

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,190
was growing - very important operating

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,050
systems were being used more than

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,880
anything else more than solaris more

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,430
than windows more than anything else

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,810
people were using bsd and then they were

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,060
using Linux and Linux was getting

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,880
popular more popular than BSD actually

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,950
for a very fundamental reason you see

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,910
what was happening right around 1997 in

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:12,460
1998 chips we're starting to have the

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,800
ability to gang up more than one chip

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,260
and actually be cost effective and smart

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,090
to do right so you could buy these these

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,200
Pentiums and he could start stacking

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,190
them across you could say oh let's have

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,780
four of them let's have two of them

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,990
let's say even eight of them right by

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,580
1999 and BSD wasn't good with multiple

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,110
CPUs back then they're very good now

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,670
don't get me wrong but they weren't good

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,780
back then and so people were like well

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,270
if I really want to take advantage of

00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,880
these extra CPUs I kind of need to use

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,820
Linux and since all I really want to do

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,950
is throw these pages down the wire

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,780
that's what I'm going to do and so

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,880
people started using Linux like crazy

00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,860
and eventually actually overtook the use

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,610
of BSD meanwhile the internet is growing

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,230
like mad right this is an important year

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,530
to be I think it's when Google was

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,120
founded - but whatever we use the Linux

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,190
at the time - for the same reasons we

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,140
wanted to pack as much power into his

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,420
cheapo box as possible right and this is

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,550
the the internet ethic in a nutshell

00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,589
right so the world's like wow all these

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,060
people are using the Linux and we want

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,680
them to use our software on that

00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,980
operating system that crazy free

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,209
operating system right so so there was a

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,370
database company back then called

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,079
Informix it was bought by IBM that same

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,420
year and they were gonna announce they

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,350
had this big marketing plan all set up

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,420
they're gonna announce that they're

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,520
gonna be the first major database vendor

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,010
of course my sequel is happily turning

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,320
out databases but they're gonna be the

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,840
first database vendor to ship on this

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
crazy hippie socialist you know platform

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,140
right

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,000
I ain't Oracle found out about it they

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,350
found out about it and a week before

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,360
informix was going to have their

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,160
beautifully orchestrated press with

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,090
their embargoed stories and all their

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,370
their PR a /

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:53,120
and you know IBM guys in suits ready to

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,130
sell you their things and Oracle scooped

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,080
them they said we're shipping on Linux

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,679
that's right Oracle's shipping on Linux

00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,730
whoo

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:06,230
of course they didn't share for six

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:07,760
months but they're shipping on Linux but

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,020
it was great people were fighting over

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,250
shipping on Linux and we're all like

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:17,320
this is awesome check it out you know

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:20,240
right but you know it was cool you know

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:24,080
right and at the same time Microsoft's

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,549
like wow this thing is our pal anymore

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,779
all right cuz up till then they were

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,340
actually being pretty friendly they were

00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,100
they were they were sharing information

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,659
with the Samba team which presents file

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:38,330
and print services from Linux and BSD

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:39,470
and UNIX is into Windows you know I'm

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,340
not sure this is going so great this

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,659
Linux thing we should start thinking

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,460
about this a little more critically and

00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:45,919
so they dialed back the cooperation of

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,929
Samba meanwhile they were kind of

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,500
crushing that scape at the time I mean

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:52,250
it's really no other word for right so

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,899
Netscape is on the rocks and so

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,270
netscape's like well what should we do

00:18:53,899 --> 00:19:00,260
like well why don't we try open sourcing

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,880
Netscape so this is when the attacks

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,500
against open source really started

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,610
interest right it wasn't just a

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,799
technical debate now as a business

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,510
debate which means you have press and

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,539
you have all these people with opinions

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,799
opinions are wonderful but back then

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:15,559
they started off with this open source

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,169
is a desperate and pathetic move for

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,590
Netscape obviously a Hail Mary pass that

00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:25,279
they're using as a last chance ditch

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,830
effort to recover their business you

00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:31,610
know the man who you talked to

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,590
it was it was that where it wasn't right

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,730
I personally feel that you know certain

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,380
thought leaders within the company

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,690
wanted it bad enough right jamie

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,830
zawinski some others right but you know

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,299
there was a little bit of the Hail Mary

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,190
to it there's a little bit that salt on

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,419
that particular wound right but it was

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,419
okay because we were all very excited

00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,929
you know because we had a couple of

00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,659
browsers going on we had you know what

00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:55,370
would become Conqueror and which was

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,679
then whose pieces were taken out for

00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,580
Safari and webkit-based browsers like

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,440
the one on Android

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,050
right but you know they were very much

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,040
in their infancy at the time right so

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,530
they said open source is desperate and

00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,510
pathetic and then this stuff came out

00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,650
and they were like hmm we're feeling

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,820
threatened by Linux we're feeling

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,980
threatened by BSG what do we do

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,600
well yeah open source is unsupported

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,670
there's nobody who's gonna help you with

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,900
that stuff you know have you seen these

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:22,580
people I heard this reporters would call

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,900
me up and they'd be like I was working

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,060
at VA Linux at the time which sold

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,470
supported linux hardware right and

00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,640
they'd be like well is there any support

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,110
for these things I'm like yes we're

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
happy to take your money for that and

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,780
they're like yes but is there any

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,320
support for these things and I'm like

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,150
your money me support them they're like

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,990
but is there any support for this and

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm like I don't

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,600
we actually weren't speaking the same

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,700
language but they were talking about

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,840
where the IBM's in the restroom and and

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,010
and there was this thing about the

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,990
database that was about it at the time

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,760
right and they were just spinning up

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,260
their professional services around the

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,180
free operating systems which I think

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,520
they've done quite well but you know so

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,320
they said open source is unsupported

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,700
right they could have gone to all these

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,110
people I list up here you can all read

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,580
and I'm not gonna really read the slides

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,250
out to you I mean unless you really want

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,670
I mean they're very clever but you know

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,370
at the end there IBM you know see a what

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,970
I see a stand before I forgotten

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,110
computer sources because I have a

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,400
certificate authority because I did a

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,500
certificate job for like a couple years

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,630
hey yeah Computer Associates you know

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,220
all these all these very large companies

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,720
started really caring about Linux and

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,610
offering support so it was very cool

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,840
right and and so this this argument

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,360
stopped working and they're like well

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,640
you know it's really expensive you know

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:34,760
that that's that support it's it's crazy

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:39,410
yeah see they charge a lot when it was

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:42,560
cheap you didn't want to buy it right

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,030
and and that's the funny thing about the

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,910
computer business it actually goes from

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:49,340
unsupported to hyper expensive right

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,050
because people know there's not a lot to

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,340
draw on right so you're kind of if you

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,320
need the support well you're gonna pay

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,180
for it but the nice thing about open

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,820
source is you're not just limited to one

00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,800
company supporting it or one network of

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,570
companies to support it everyone can

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,400
anybody who wants to make that money can

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,370
go out and make that money and that was

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,860
really cool right so like okay so the

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,910
support thing doesn't work so I start

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,870
getting these calls from reporters you

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,330
know I'm

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,100
hearing that open source is insecure and

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,270
I'm like well that that's what I can't

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,059
imagine who you're hearing that from

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,500
right no really I mean there was a

00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,570
concern young people who around this

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,340
business before do these yeah you

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,930
remember the Cimarron pearl especially

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,450
people using pearl that's not a real

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,090
language you know and a lot of people

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:36,680
still feel that way but you know it's

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:38,120
like cartoon people swearing see you can

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,270
always save the pearl jokes when you're

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,270
thirsty

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,730
so they say open source is insecure and

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,530
I'd say well software is insecure and it

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,470
what sort of software therefore open

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:53,120
source is insecure right well not really

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,929
though so what's funny about open source

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,540
and I'm not going to give you that

00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:59,840
before your eyes bug shallow stuff

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,190
because it doesn't work right if you

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,380
look at the vast majority of open source

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,620
software it's one developer messing

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,210
around right and that's true but the

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,120
popular open source software

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,040
the Apaches the kernels that the other

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,929
things they don't get to become popular

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,450
unless they pay attention to these very

00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:19,520
real security needs and so what I say is

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,140
that popular open source software is

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,510
more secure than a proprietary

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,540
equivalent and the reason for that is

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:28,580
because it has to be or doesn't become

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,020
popular right so that's my logic that I

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,940
wanted to share with you right and that

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,590
eventually actually took hold not

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,450
because of anything I did my chai mean I

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,880
responded to my reporters in all the

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,040
right ways but you know the reality of

00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,010
computer science shines through right

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:47,210
people not getting paged at 3:00 in the

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,410
morning shines through Linux is a cancer

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,820
that's like wow that's that's a new

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,740
tactic you know so this is you know I

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,870
love coding like this because like one

00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,400
of my lawyers so Google is large enough

00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,960
that lawyers are actually able to spend

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,290
the time to review presentations and

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,250
they're like do you really say that

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,860
because we have a couple of people who

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,750
are newer to this space and and that's

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,820
okay by the way doesn't mean they're bad

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:20,840
lawyers it means they're just new and I

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:23,390
was like yeah not funny and I'm like I'm

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,220
like that's what we said and

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,020
yeah this is what they say lose cancer

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,830
they said Linux is a spoiler communist

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:33,500
socialist anti-business lefty right so

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,360
it's funny the history of the socialist

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,540
word with Linux like I said this is

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,430
entertainment not so much learning but

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,900
so in 1998 there was this great panel

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,630
discussion and it was a future of Linux

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,400
we called it and we had we had you know

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,050
Jeremy Allison we had linen store vods

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,520
we had a bunch of folks up there on

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,740
stage I wish I think we do is they're

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,570
kind of Quito's in the room you know

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,940
someone from Intel so you know six Anna

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,680
and a couple other folks and and

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,300
somebody went up to them Mike you know

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,040
forgive me for asking but communism

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,810
you're giving this stuff away you're all

00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,060
pitching together it sounds like

00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:11,360
communism and I said and I was like well

00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:17,420
yeah people gonna ask this right and and

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,950
Jeremy looks over it he says yeah he's

00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:26,150
like so you're not calm you said no I'm

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:28,010
socialist just like the but but when

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,070
when the whole schoo IBM thing was sort

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,780
of in it's heated up period every story

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,110
was about this and I was at least from

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,210
the open source perspective write a

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,830
bunch of free software you know regulars

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,420
you know our troops on the ground the

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,740
secret army they all decided to get

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,510
together and go in protested this Co

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,580
office right over this whole ridiculous

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:49,910
lawsuit thing right and when they did

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,070
that there was a counter protest of a

00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,500
couple folks inside the company who

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,620
worked for girl and they had signs that

00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:01,820
they had used during the 2000 election I

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,740
bet you want a recount to it was really

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,350
weird I mean they literally were trying

00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,910
to resurrect because this was like 2001

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,520
when this happened and they were trying

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,310
to resurrect the debates around the

00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:18,230
American election as being an equivalent

00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:22,600
to this open source crazy well they were

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,600
so and they said open source is crap

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,230
okay

00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:29,570
I guess no one will want to use us I

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,760
said it's not crap but it doesn't care

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,320
about real business needs and and this

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,430
is a long-running thread through the

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,460
history of its first they say you know

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,110
what

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,580
you guys have got compilers but you

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,740
don't have any actually operating system

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,150
oh well you've got this Colonel thing B

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,760
you don't really have it's all

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:48,960
programmers stuff right you've got Perl

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,700
and Python and and and and C it's not

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,230
real time we don't actually you don't

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,210
have anything for like the end user and

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,890
then open offices release from Sun they

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,060
said well you've got this office suite

00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,590
but you don't have a bro you have a

00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,820
browser well you have a browser but you

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:05,270
don't have databases you have databases

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:09,210
oh you don't have business intelligence

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,710
it turns out there is because people use

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,270
to ask me what will never be open source

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,490
and I had this stock answer I said well

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,790
oil field management software

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,370
I said that's never gonna be open source

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,290
and Exxon Mobil they went into a little

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:25,020
open source community with Chevron and

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,840
with the other oil companies to create a

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,220
big oil field management software

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,170
because it was so damn expensive for any

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,780
individual company to create it they had

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,790
to they were spending an order of a half

00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,280
a billion dollars a year just creating

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,330
software for their oil fields there are

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,010
L rigs and all the rest and they went to

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,510
the other oil companies and said you

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,700
know we're not competing here we all

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,380
have to do this let's work together and

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,720
you see this at the high end of all the

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,990
software community it's like oh weird

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,520
you know and so ok supports this really

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:57,540
real business Tina I'll talk about that

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,910
with Google too and this is well you'll

00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,170
notice that I said they said no somebody

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,490
else but when it doesn't say that it's

00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,970
me saying it so open-source is made a

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,860
meet and what I like to remind people is

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,230
that open source is written by people

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,630
right one of the things they're trying

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,670
to say right now is that open source

00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,380
doesn't care about the end-user right

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,420
they're trying this thing again but the

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,400
reality is is open source people are the

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,350
end user and the best open source

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,060
applications are the ones of which the

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,680
open source developers are the end user

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,150
because they know the bugs that they're

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,530
creating when they create their software

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,810
they know what they have to fix they

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:34,470
know what features they want and that's

00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:36,810
really cool right and and in general

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,010
they don't want this is a red herring I

00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,360
apologize for that I really shouldn't

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,400
use red herrings I'm doing this but

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,690
so I say and they don't wanna waste

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,820
their time writing yet another stupid

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,210
function another stupid library or

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,280
another

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,950
CMS and that's why we only have one CMS

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,230
and

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,510
you know only one database and one

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,250
kernel and one compiler okay people

00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,299
obviously like rewriting code and if you

00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,340
actually look at what people are doing

00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:59,620
the things they don't rewrite are things

00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,269
like you know an XML parsing library

00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,370
they can just include write or some

00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,870
other library tool right but it turns

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,880
out they like rewriting this stuff they

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,090
like rewriting it all the time I mean

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,889
how many XML rewriting XML processing

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:15,220
libraries are there for Perl it's like

00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:16,480
all XML parsing libraries down right I'm

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,049
sorry I keep on calling on them but they

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,370
set up front so you know so why are

00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,630
people doing this open source stuff

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,980
again if they're if they keep on

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,960
rewriting stuff they're not getting that

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,639
productivity game it's not it's not

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,289
rankle easiness right so why are they

00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:30,130
doing it well we asked them all right

00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,899
there were a lot of people going out

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,210
there saying it's a cargo cult it's a

00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:36,880
gift economy it's like why you just ask

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,039
him you know so we did we asked 10,000

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,679
developers on SourceForge we said why

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,590
are you actually doing this stuff right

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,139
is it some sort of weird thing and it

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,690
wasn't just people who wanted to be

00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:51,460
smarter right they want to become better

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,049
at what they did they didn't want to

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,260
wake up in 3:00 in the morning by their

00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:58,149
pager right IRA a network of 1200

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,850
Microsoft mail for the Macintosh users

00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:04,090
when they were converting from PowerPC

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:07,120
from the 68k processors I was woken up

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,159
every hour for three months I didn't

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,950
want that

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:16,269
that's terrible job right yeah cheap

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:17,440
laughs from the swear words you know and

00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:18,370
then there was idealism they're like you

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,600
know I want to share this technology

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,799
with my friends I want to share this

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,919
with my colleagues when I may consider

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,039
science better it's really cool you know

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,260
and then only down here at the bottom

00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:32,019
was it about not liking somebody else

00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,179
all right it was about I want to kill

00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:35,620
Microsoft or whatever and this is cool

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,269
you know because it was never for me

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,919
about that I don't love computers right

00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:42,100
if it was a world without open-source

00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,570
I'd still love them right but yeah this

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,700
was really cool to find out this is

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,860
people who developed developers people

00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:51,370
who are coding right that's why they're

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:54,539
doing it that's pretty great right and

00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,919
they said well unprofessional

00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,940
open-source is made by a bunch of drunk

00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,940
long-haired lecherous hippies

00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,100
so that's how uncocks long hair

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,660
that's Lina's drinking a beer that's

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,940
Miguel he's just cute and young whatever

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,570
that's Jeremy dressed up as a lecherous

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,100
old fella

00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,570
that's Guido but I'm sure there's beer

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,530
somewhere there's beer all over this

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:20,530
thing and there's people making out I

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:22,330
mean yeah so that's true cause like I

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,820
said software's made by people people

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,220
are people right

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,990
so they said open-source is a dangerous

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,870
thing it is coming right for us it is

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:35,080
going to ruin America and American

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:37,510
business that's kind of true right it

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,950
could it has this potential what what

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,780
open-source does do to the computer

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,650
industry is very very interesting it

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,880
removes some opportunities for

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,010
traditional licensing revenue this is

00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,200
absolutely true but doesn't mean that

00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,060
it's bad it's just it does change things

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,490
if you wanted to go out and create a new

00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,980
UNIX right now from scratch you'd be

00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,520
insane how many of you think that'd be a

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,500
good idea okay see I mean that's tyranny

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,640
of the majority right but you know if

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,900
you're creating a new UNIX now it's

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,190
because you want to it's not because you

00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,600
need to make money from it right or

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,450
maybe you have some plan that I don't

00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,860
understand it's coming from everywhere

00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:18,640
it can't be made to go away right so

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,200
it's one of those things you can either

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,960
get on the you can get run over

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,510
by it or start farming off on the side

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,760
whatever it's a bad analogy but so who

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,260
got crushed well as coherent got crushed

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,200
coherent was a vendor of UNIX and

00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:35,290
expensive viewings let's go is in some

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,370
state of crushing myths you know there

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,050
used to be a lot of compiler vendors

00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,970
people forget this there were a lot of

00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,790
very talented developers working on

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,290
compilers they still are they're just

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,940
not working for compiler companies they

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,260
don't exist anymore and there's probably

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,960
like one or two don't get me wrong but

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,330
there were a lot of them before that

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,340
doesn't exist anymore a bunch of

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,070
workstation companies got marginalized

00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,630
out right well if your business was

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:03,280
largely low in UNIX workstations bye-bye

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:06,160
that was a tough world that was a tough

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,200
thing the tough lesson to learn and most

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,360
people who sold software that competed

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,830
where we're open source was insanely

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,289
great web servers and there

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,549
this is a hard road to hoe and this is

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:18,380
something that people have to understand

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:19,700
you know we don't worry about creating

00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,409
these kinds of tools anymore because

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,789
open-source has done that which gives us

00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:24,260
a lot of opportunity above that layer

00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:27,649
but there were a lot of people doing

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,059
this so or their Microsoft right

00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:31,070
Microsoft's still very successful

00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:34,970
companies selling proprietary software

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,870
they compete with open source so open

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,399
source is good for you this isn't me

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,779
saying that right so some people said

00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,789
well wait a second you know why don't we

00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:42,590
take these this effort

00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:44,840
the societal effort we've been making in

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,399
recreating compilers and recreating UNIX

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,200
is recompete and creating these tools

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,929
and see what else we can do with that

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,279
right and so Oracle IBM include

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,720
ourselves Google we're very good users

00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,830
of open source software I talk about how

00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,080
we give it back to it's not just about

00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,730
use but you know people got in front of

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,100
it they said well there's an opportunity

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,440
here and maybe we don't understand what

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,659
that opportunity is yet but there it's

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,849
there so let's figure this out and many

00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:11,929
people have so another argument that

00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:13,639
people would say and I didn't put it in

00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,099
the vase head format they would say open

00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,349
source is is unusable difficult to

00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,629
maintain difficult to configure this is

00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,190
software in a nutshell though software

00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:25,750
is difficult to maintain and difficult

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,879
to configure you know I list some some

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,940
half-joking half not complex software is

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,980
complex to administer right I think

00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,190
that's the nature of complex tools and

00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,409
that's not open source or proprietary

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,310
that's software right and we have a lot

00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:42,560
of things and actually we're talking

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,849
about if I can pimp the company I mean

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,109
we're talking about a lot of really cool

00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,580
technology that makes software

00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:48,500
development easier software scaling

00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:52,060
easier and that's remarkable this work

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,109
but complex software is often complex

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,389
you know that doesn't change just

00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,890
because it's open source or because it's

00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,150
proprietary so I should probably work

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,220
this slide to make it a little nicer but

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:09,470
whatever and because I'm basically

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:12,250
sliding on everyone's like I have an

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,250
application I hate

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,670
so one of the things I like to point out

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,310
to people as open-source is fast this is

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:20,530
good and bad mind you right you know

00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,060
there's a lot of exciting work going on

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,440
in the open source world it's not

00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,630
standing still if anyone ever tries to

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,890
tell you that open source is a people

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,020
are dinosaurs in the open source world

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,670
obsessed with their UNIX is and all the

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,700
rest I mean that's crazy talk

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,290
open source is remarkable I mean there

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,560
was I'm not trying to slag on anybody

00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,210
here when I say this there was a person

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,550
in the Linux kernel they're like we get

00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,230
more patches in one day than most

00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,800
proprietary software will get in its

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,170
lifetime right even most open source for

00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,030
that matter right so it's like once you

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,050
have a project that's got some steam

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,810
built up

00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,870
it's remarkable it's really something

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,540
and and and and if it's mature enough

00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:04,320
it's also those patches represent

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,310
responsiveness to use or concern and

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,290
that can be a problem right because

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,480
people make money off of computers when

00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,700
they break it's harder to make money off

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,860
of computers when they don't right if

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,810
you can charge that monthly revenue for

00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,920
going in and cleaning up a log file or

00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,690
whatever it is you have to do to

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,780
maintain a monthly revenue stream from

00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:27,220
bad software you know that's good money

00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,570
right but I actually believe this I

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,910
think that open source is a problem for

00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,950
consultancy is because it's really good

00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:35,530
it's designed to be really good it's

00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,720
designed to be reliable right and you

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,910
see this with people who work in the

00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,710
open source world they've learned that

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,260
trying to make the money on the

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,150
integration services the feature add-ons

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,500
whatever but if you go down the support

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,360
route it's not gonna be as lucrative

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,130
sometimes and this is this is tough on

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,970
people because for a lot of folks the

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,930
money in open source was a support story

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,880
so one of things I like to point out as

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,790
open source is free you know you don't

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,360
have to pay for it so Google has about

00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:05,980
14 computers right so if we had to so if

00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,950
we had to pay for proprietary operating

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,950
systems on all 14 of those computers it

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,140
would be a substantial amount of money

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,810
non-trivial amounts of money right no

00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:20,650
matter who you are right

00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:23,260
and it's free its reason beer sometimes

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,460
that's important because software costs

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,270
money if you're not spending on the

00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,090
software you spent

00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,290
the hardware for instance but it also is

00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,900
that free to do with it as you please

00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:34,210
this is you know review for a lot of you

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,560
I know that but you're also free to not

00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,730
use it you're free to go away you're

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,770
free to go do what you want with it

00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,360
right we have some patches in the Linux

00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,540
kernel our data centers that are absurd

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,890
they're crazy you know like if anybody

00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,150
else if they'd told me about that before

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,250
I started there I had a really question

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:51,190
about working there right but they make

00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,720
sense for us right so we do them right

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,580
and it's cool but there's this other

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,030
freedom that nobody ever talks about

00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,270
right when Google was using my sequel

00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,890
for Oh a forex really everyone else had

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:05,380
moved on to five except for people like

00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,119
Google right and we had these patches

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,450
when these patches made replication

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,750
really much better for my sequel for X

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:15,850
and so you know we went to my sequence

00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,320
say do you want these how like we're

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,150
kind of moved on we're in for the five

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,460
land and we have stuff like that already

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,619
in five really okay so we just really

00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,730
suit our selves right and a bunch of

00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:27,119
people adopted this stuff because I

00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,080
hadn't gone on to 5x yet

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,340
and then they it was funny it was

00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,510
actually an opportunity for my sequel to

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,710
make money off of patches and something

00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,080
else it created because they went to

00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,890
them and said please support us on these

00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,660
Google patches and they're like okay you

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,710
know and they figured it out and we we

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,540
made it so they could bring it into a

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,490
later version of the software but you

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,050
know we were free to release those

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,450
patches into the community of people who

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,820
has the same problems that we do and we

00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,350
do this more often than we really talk

00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,230
about because it can be seen as being

00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,340
very aggressive and you know we don't

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,040
wanna be seen as that kind of company

00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:02,859
but the reality is that freedom to

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,560
create your own fork here on branch your

00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:07,630
own community within a larger community

00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,180
of open-source developers is incredibly

00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,300
powerful especially as you start really

00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:15,580
becoming a heavy user of this technology

00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:18,250
so I talked about this already so I'm

00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:21,910
just gonna skip it open source is all

00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:24,280
around so how many of you own a thing

00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,799
you all own things well so the reality

00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,349
is is that GCC is used to develop almost

00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:34,210
everything that has a battery a chip

00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:36,160
washing machine you know whatever you

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,690
know it's like GCC is almost ubiquitous

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,569
in the embedded space and that's going

00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,309
to be true until LLVM rises to the floor

00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:44,920
and then the story will be the BSD

00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:45,819
licensed LLVM compiler I firmly believe

00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,099
I know that sounds a little unusual

00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:50,140
because I'm really calling a shot that's

00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:52,839
five years seven years down the pike but

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,359
yeah open-source compilers matter right

00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,740
they make basically if they didn't exist

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,450
we would have to create them you know a

00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,920
blackberry I don't know if my little

00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:04,299
green laser has this chip in it but if

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,520
it does GCC right so yeah obviously

00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:08,020
every time we visit Google open source

00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,270
runs the Internet we've already talked

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,819
about this many many talks you can go

00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,470
look at these stats yourself open-source

00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:16,630
friends business friends the world it's

00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:22,809
magic so this is the intermission before

00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:24,789
I start the Google part I have 19

00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:26,859
minutes so really 9 minutes to get

00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:28,630
question that but we'll work it out so

00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,609
opens first is Magic for Google right

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,000
and what does that mean well I'll tell

00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:33,279
you

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,839
coincidental you know it's magically

00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:36,789
easy for us to use it's very easy for us

00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:38,559
to bring code into Google it was very

00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:39,640
lucky in that we kind of don't ship a

00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,869
lot of things I mean we have Google

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,029
Earth and Picasa and the Search

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,260
Appliance but considering the amount of

00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:46,000
engineering that goes on at Google and

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,529
the amount of open source we use we

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,059
don't use open source in such a way that

00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,650
demands a lot from a compliance

00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,869
standpoint so we're very lucky there

00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,329
right but the coolest thing about open

00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:57,910
source for all companies right is that

00:40:55,329 --> 00:41:01,390
they use the same licenses remember I

00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:05,650
talked about the 99.9 in in any bar case

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,760
the bar in math you know the great thing

00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,490
about that is you can go to your lawyer

00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,250
and say listen I have this piece of MIT

00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:14,859
license code what do you think of it and

00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,789
they go oh the MIT license oh you know

00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:16,240
we're pretty used to that we've seen

00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:18,730
that before

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,130
so if you see an MIT license this is all

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,599
you need to know XYZ same thing is true

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,200
of all the other popular open-source

00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,000
licenses see the thing is software has

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,730
licenses every piece of software how

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,619
many of you have a Macintosh sorry an

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,329
iPhone an iPhone so if you look at the

00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:35,759
iPhone in the legal section it's a great

00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,960
little document it's like

00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:41,410
20 pages long of all the open-source

00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,849
licenses that are in there it's really

00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,279
easy once you get comfortable with a

00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:47,140
license to just bring it in bring in all

00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:48,250
that functionality have your many many

00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,509
engineers not working on that

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,690
functionality and working on things that

00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:54,130
are cool for you your value-add is or

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:57,430
you know that's really powerful people

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,799
don't realize how powerful that is when

00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:02,140
I do a deal a joint development deal

00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:04,210
with the University it doesn't look like

00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,529
standard joint development deals and I

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,759
get it done in about three weeks which

00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:08,650
is impossible all I say to them it's

00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:10,029
like listen I need to give you money and

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,789
you're gonna write code and you're gonna

00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,930
release it under an apache license if

00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:15,880
you don't really sort of the apache

00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,259
license you won't get the second half of

00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,690
the money that's it that's the deal

00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,950
right we structured as as we have

00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,630
sometimes have a statement of work and I

00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,700
take a little bit of time in in the

00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,950
legal area but if that university can

00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,960
release open-source code we're done from

00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,000
an electoral property standpoint if I

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,109
want to enter into a traditional joint

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,690
development agreement where we end up

00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:37,210
owning intellectual property it can take

00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,640
six to nine months and this is not just

00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:41,740
universities right if you do this with

00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,299
companies six to nine months if you do

00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,759
with the free software foundation if you

00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,930
want to have a broad-based agreement

00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:48,819
with the Free Software Foundation saying

00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,660
any Googler can give you a patch and you

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:53,319
can accept it

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:55,359
that took me two years right joint

00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,640
development joint intellectual property

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,650
is really hard and it's not because

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,660
anybody doesn't want to do it and it's

00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,769
not because people are evil or wrong or

00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,890
want more control or less control

00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:07,539
although it feels like that at the time

00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:10,119
it's just complicated and busy and

00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:11,589
everyone's busy so it takes forever but

00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,329
once you get used to these licenses what

00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,130
you you put that in there and say listen

00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:17,619
that's the deal people say well you know

00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,940
we understand the apache license they

00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:20,109
release it we already understand as a

00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,210
company on how to pull it in

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,609
there's no weird copyright getting moved

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,549
around and all the rest it's easy it's

00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,410
simple it's great right and the nice

00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:31,779
thing about it too is as a company we've

00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:34,539
created common tools that look for these

00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:35,829
licenses and can track them so that when

00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:38,319
we do release a Google Search Appliance

00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:40,329
a Picasa and the rest we know exactly

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,920
what we're releasing so we know exactly

00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,210
what the announced what properties

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,289
standpoint is there and that's really

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,869
important from just a government

00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:48,549
standpoint so it's fundamental to us

00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:49,180
every time you use Google you're using

00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:50,890
Linux

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,990
every single one of those 14 servers is

00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,299
running Linux and all the software in

00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,579
there was built using GCC and

00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:00,099
open-source compilers every single one

00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:01,630
right and so it's really important to us

00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:03,190
the language is you know people think of

00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,630
Google is doing all this crazy stuff

00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,190
with open source but where it matters

00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,650
most to us are these fundamental levels

00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,630
Linux the compilers and our teams come

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,940
from the mainstream Linux the mainstream

00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,529
compiler world right and they're able to

00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,809
release and they do release quite often

00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:18,430
we're we're now like the 11th most

00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:20,170
common patcher into the Linux kernel

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,119
which is not bad and certainly we only

00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,579
really started doing active patching

00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:25,990
about four years ago right I mean red

00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,390
hats on all the rest from there way

00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:33,069
ahead of us but so I feel pretty good

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:34,359
about that yeah so and then you have all

00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:36,490
the software we've built and they use

00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,200
libraries that are out there that are

00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,279
useful to us and there's some libraries

00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,240
that jump out at you all the time like

00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:45,760
open SSL pcre and and and those very

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,589
common ones right but then it's all

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,390
longtail you know people love a word

00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:50,740
longtail well there's a long tail of

00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:53,770
open-source libraries out there turns

00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:56,529
out especially in the Java world and

00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,760
that's really useful to us oh yeah and

00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:59,980
my sequel you can't forget my sequel

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,390
amazingly useful tool for us so these

00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,839
are kinds of things that we rely on we

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,279
love we do whatever we can to help and

00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,289
that's nice all right so I talked about

00:45:06,279 --> 00:45:09,549
time and legal blah blah blah but the

00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,720
thing I want to mention is when we do

00:45:09,549 --> 00:45:12,400
release we generally really Center

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,490
Apache than any other license we've

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:19,089
released under the EPL the LGPL the GPL

00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:21,730
GPL v3 v2 I mean you name it right but

00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:22,750
we we generally release under the apache

00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,480
license because we feel that's the

00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,740
fairest license for all of us inside

00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,819
there there's the statement about

00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,470
patents there's a statement about

00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:32,170
trademarks it says when you use this

00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:34,240
code you know that anything in there

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,490
that came from Google that is a Google

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,339
patent we're saying to you that patent

00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:40,750
that we're expressing in this code is

00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:42,970
yours to use free of charge and for your

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,230
users to use free of charge and that's

00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,029
something that the apache license in the

00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:49,480
GPL v3 do quite well and none of the

00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:50,890
other licenses do alright so there's

00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,589
some minority licenses but again we

00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:54,940
don't try to use those right so that's

00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:56,260
really important there's also wording in

00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,400
there about use of trademark and stuff

00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,960
that matters to us too

00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,250
so you can basically release your piece

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,780
of software that uses some Google

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,700
technology and say go

00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,070
I mean you kind of can it's it's

00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,450
complicated we actually were very happy

00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,990
when you use our API is us just come

00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:12,700
talk to us anyway and then you as a

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,020
developer can take this code and know

00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,820
exactly what we're talking about it's

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,590
not the Google open-source license it's

00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,190
not the Google Creative Commons tax

00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,900
license

00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:22,570
it's the Creative Commons license it's

00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,700
the apache license it's the GPL it's the

00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,700
LGPL you know what we mean because those

00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:30,280
licenses exist outside of Google in the

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,620
sort of a cynical way you don't have to

00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,630
trust us because you already trust

00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,300
Apache because they are trustworthy

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,500
they're there they're worthy of it right

00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,780
even if you don't think we are and I

00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,770
think we are but you don't have to and

00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,140
that's another great thing about

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,870
third-party licenses and why you should

00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:49,500
be suspicious of new open-source

00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:52,990
licenses that created just for one thing

00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:57,280
one release one company their species

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:58,360
and that's why so that's kind of how I'm

00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,080
wrapping up I just want to talk about

00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,030
Summer of Code

00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,650
it's a project we do so if you look back

00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,210
at what I just first started Google some

00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,930
four years ago one of the things that

00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,600
people come up to new companies

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,920
conferences they say listen yeah Google

00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,570
is fine thanks for searching all that

00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,770
but but you know my friend Tom was

00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,120
working on some source project you went

00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,860
to go work for Google and I haven't seen

00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,570
a patch from them since and it wasn't

00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,340
that Tom hated the project or he didn't

00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,050
even want to patch it so sometimes when

00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,940
they came to Google they they found that

00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,670
some of the problems we had were really

00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,230
interesting and I have to be honest with

00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,870
you after you've worked on the single

00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:34,240
piece of software for five years ten

00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:36,070
years you know or in the case of vim

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,900
which brands been working on for 20

00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,470
years sometimes you don't want to do it

00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,260
anymore

00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:42,810
you're tired of it right and maybe there

00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,400
isn't someone to pick it up and so

00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,990
people go away sometimes so we thought

00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,130
to ourselves you know this is a problem

00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,140
right

00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,730
not that Google is doing there's a huge

00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,890
part of this but this just happens and

00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,750
and if you went to open-source you guys

00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,830
have been to a lot of how many people at

00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,950
the Pearl conferences are the same

00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:02,920
people you met 12 years ago all of them

00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,840
right all right so it's about half

00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,010
that's good but but you started seeing

00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,510
the same people over and over and over

00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,900
again I'm like this is driving me crazy

00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:13,030
I mean I like you guys I like all of you

00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,080
but I'd like to meet more of you and I'd

00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,250
like more of you to work on open source

00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,440
it's not good for open

00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,930
source first all to keep on getting

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,150
continually older right I mean if we're

00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:24,400
relying on Linus for the kernel ten

00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,800
years from now 20 years from now 40

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,150
years trying he's gonna die eventually

00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,160
right we're all gonna die

00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,660
Robert shouldn't shouldn't this work

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,250
live on this is the great thing about

00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,230
open source is it doesn't die with the

00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:38,110
company or the developer it's still

00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,760
there right so we said well how can we

00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,170
create more of these people how can how

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,450
can we do that Larry Page came up to me

00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:45,340
it was mine I've been at Google maybe

00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,470
eight months right and we had launched

00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,990
code.google.com for compliance purposes

00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,120
and for the beginnings of our API story

00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:55,000
and he said to me Chris I want you to do

00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,530
me a favor okay what's that he said well

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,300
there are a lot of computer science

00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:04,450
students who over the summer aren't

00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:08,620
doing computer science yeah I want you

00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:10,330
to fix that and I'm like really he's

00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:14,620
like yeah go do that he gave me some

00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:16,450
targets and okay and so Greg and I are

00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,520
like oh what do we do we're fun we're

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,050
functionally kind of lazy people but

00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,100
were the open source people so all these

00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,750
open source people what if we gave them

00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,190
students and so we kicked off the Summer

00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,960
of Code where we would pay students to

00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:28,090
work on open source software over the

00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,010
summer that first year we had 200 people

00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,150
and we told Larry Page were like well

00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,130
you know if you to other people's right

00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:35,560
number and he's like you can't do a

00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,880
thousand and I'm like no I can't do a

00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,520
thousand he's like well why not I'm like

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,540
cuz I'm only one person it's like well

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,310
you should fix that too okay you know

00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,780
and all these people applied to take

00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,390
part we're like ah you know we're

00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,770
throwing out it was absurdly badly you

00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,670
know handled from a webapp perspective

00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,950
we were basically throwing around

00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:57,310
spreadsheets really with 6000

00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:59,620
applications in them anyway and so we

00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,840
doubled it to 400 that year and that was

00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:04,360
cool then we went to 600 to 900 now

00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,280
we're at 1,100 kids so it's a great

00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,470
project it reduces people open source

00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,060
but it also introduces computer

00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,110
scientists to real user needs this is

00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,210
something none of you need to be

00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,230
reminded of but you know I don't know if

00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,730
you can remember for those of you who

00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,780
went to computer science school you know

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,190
you're given theory you're given

00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,720
practice you've been homework for even a

00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,550
couple group projects but you're not

00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,930
giving users all right for the most part

00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,550
you're not your users are yourselves in

00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,810
here and ostensibly your teacher but

00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,850
that I could be finally bug reports and

00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,840
saying I really need this or you you

00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,880
corrupted my database

00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,140
right so it's a really great project

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,190
because they're exposed to actual

00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:36,340
computer science I don't know how many

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:40,960
of them leave the field after this but

00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:42,730
isn't it better they leave now but but

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,410
no but seriously it's it's it's a great

00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,420
project so that's the Summer of Code

00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,640
that's this year you know we've had over

00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,410
1,500 graduates we have two to three

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,840
thousand mentors who have mentored

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,940
students over the last four years this

00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,130
year we're in like I think it's 95

00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,600
countries and it's pretty remarkable

00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,340
last year alone we created two and a

00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,650
half million 2.1 million depending on

00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,790
how you count and and lines of code by

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,130
the way it's a terrible measure of

00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,450
anything we know this you know that line

00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,210
of pearl is not the same thing as line

00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:12,310
of Python clearly it's not the same as a

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,660
line of C and so on and so forth I mean

00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,490
we had some students who had generated

00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:18,280
30,000 lines of code for their project

00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:20,470
some were 2,000 right but we sort of

00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,000
said ok let's seems like a happy centers

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,830
around 3,000 lines of code so we figured

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,140
we generated about 2.1 million lines of

00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,550
code last year and that's code that goes

00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,200
back in benefits Google for sure but it

00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,550
benefits all of us and keeps women

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,600
source healthy and that's pretty

00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:36,070
remarkable this one student right so

00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,530
fewer tour who created nmap and is a

00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:39,850
remarkable security developer the first

00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,770
years of the Summer of Code he took on

00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:44,740
ten developers all by himself and we

00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:46,150
were like are you crazy no he was but

00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,140
that's ok he was also really really good

00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:52,150
at what he did so this was one of them

00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,680
and so Adriana did an nmap project

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,270
passed with flying colors it's a

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,940
merit-based program we fail about 20% of

00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:00,460
the students every year he passed with

00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,530
flying colors and then he said the

00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,850
problem with end map is it's kind of

00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:09,100
ugly so he had seen the use of end map

00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,600
in the Matrix movies and so he created

00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,780
umut which is a really pretty interface

00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:18,580
on end map and hewmet stands for use me

00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:20,410
instead trinity right and so in in in

00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,970
later movies people use the human

00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:24,640
interface on 10 map because it's

00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:27,190
prettier right so it's sort of like a

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,780
funny joke but the reality is is he

00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,890
created a new project he's a mentor he's

00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,870
read a bunch of students through it and

00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,250
they both have terrific project Scion so

00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,800
open-source has gotten better and that's

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,300
the goal so why are we doing this well

00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,280
it's good for us sure

00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,160
but it's really good for the internet

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,850
member the internet runs on open-source

00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,410
right and the

00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:46,360
and why the Internet is a great business

00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,670
and a great opportunity for all of us is

00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,530
because it can't really block any of us

00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,660
out you can't be locked out of

00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:54,250
developing for the internet right the

00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,500
way you can on proprietary platforms

00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,940
right I mean that's just how it is right

00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,350
you know you're gonna be able to get

00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,700
your DNS address you're gonna be able to

00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,170
send traffic to it you've got to be able

00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,150
to serve your customers that's really

00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,920
cool and it's really cool because of

00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,810
open-source software they are so

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,580
intimately intertwined right

00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,870
you're able to build value on top of the

00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,770
internet because of open-source and so

00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,540
we want to make sure the open-source

00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:16,180
remained healthy and presented that

00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,080
opportunity ongoing so that's what's

00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,670
good for the internet and what's good

00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,020
for the Internet is good for Google as

00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:22,960
you heard earlier and that's very very

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,870
true and that's it I'll take any

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,000
questions there's a microphone right

00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:38,010
here and we have 6 minutes and 36

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:41,640
seconds 3534 that's the microphone there

00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,640
or I can tell more stories

00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,690
I'd rather answer questions hi you

00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:48,040
talked about Summer of Code I could talk

00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:53,140
about the highly open participation

00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:54,160
project for about 2 years she was like

00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,870
we should do a high school program I'm

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,200
like yeah we should but I really don't

00:53:55,870 --> 00:54:00,280
want to talk to parents okay I was like

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,320
well we just could be the Summer of Code

00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,640
you know that's like a delaying tactic

00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,100
because it's always so long all

00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,240
engrossing and so she finally came to me

00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,440
she came to me followed last year and

00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,530
she said okay I'm gonna launch the high

00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,790
school program I'm like okay I said to

00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:14,290
her this is really my guidelines that's

00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,280
like there's two things I need from you

00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:18,190
though she's like what's that I was like

00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,780
I can't talk to parents okay she's like

00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:22,720
that's fine I was like and I can't talk

00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:24,460
to parents she's like fine so if she

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,060
launched and she had 400 students taking

00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,860
part over over the base of the winter it

00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:32,470
went like November December January ish

00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:35,410
and we had 400 students do over a

00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:37,120
thousand tasks they were smaller and the

00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,920
idea was if you do three tasks he win an

00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,690
award of a hundred dollars that's their

00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,370
will stack them up and and make some

00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,990
money but also do some open source and

00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,250
it was really cool we had some students

00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,490
that I did I think there was one student

00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:49,780
it's like 43 tasks I mean just amazing

00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,160
work and then I have to tell you

00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,270
something it's like I had projects

00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,040
coming to me and saying you know we've

00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:56,360
got a problem like what's that we don't

00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,340
have anything left to do

00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,200
like really and they're like yeah every

00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,300
spell every word is spelled correctly on

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,800
our website every page looks beautiful

00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,700
we've got great themes all across and

00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,670
because they're allowed to do very small

00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:10,670
tasks right and like they're all done

00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:16,050
and then come up with hundreds of them

00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,900
right that's kind of how it worked out

00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,580
so that's the participation program we

00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,190
want to do it again if I do it again in

00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,990
the fall is my guess once the summer

00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,330
codes wrapped up and so I haven't sort

00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,700
of ping-pong off each other you know so

00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,960
it's pretty cool and also it does answer

00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,160
this question of what if people do

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,320
because summer code is only open to

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,880
people 18 or over and we'd have these

00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,830
these kids show up who are just

00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,390
brilliant I don't know if we don't in

00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,980
the room but there's a 13 year old who's

00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:44,280
doing more work on Python right now than

00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,780
most well the guido right and it's just

00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,940
like wow how do we call me how we help

00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:53,600
that kid that's this remarkable stuff so

00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:57,690
you want an apology for the project I

00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,150
want to fight the a lot of people kind

00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:01,560
of principles are all well and good but

00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,300
you know a lot of people swore they'd

00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,460
never use proprietary software again you

00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,170
know can I pose 1999 or whatever and

00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,420
then OSX came out and all the geek

00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,370
switch to that and people swore they'd

00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,290
never you know never see adverts on the

00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:14,910
Internet until AdWords came out it was

00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,320
you know frictionless to go and put ads

00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,030
on your on your blog and then suddenly

00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,120
everyone's got AdWords cuz you know it

00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,260
doesn't matter if it's just me you know

00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:26,070
one of the reasons why people so that

00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:27,240
was a little big there one of the so and

00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:29,010
what I think one of the reasons why

00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,690
people do open-source oh because it's

00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,460
just not worth selling their stuff it's

00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,930
you know the input the the overhead of

00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,730
trying to sell yourself will be way too

00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,340
much for the the effort you're putting

00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:40,740
out for like you know your little poll

00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:43,170
yeah but if somebody came along and

00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:46,140
provided like a zero friction sales

00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:49,800
thing kind of like the iPhone App Store

00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,360
so now that do you ever worry that a lot

00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,360
of this stuff a little things will go

00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,860
away kind of like the the the OSX kind

00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,140
of little app market where people charge

00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,580
you ten dollars for you know wrap around

00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,950
a sink or something like that do you

00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,960
ever worry about that so you're kind of

00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:05,130
asking a larger question in my mind you

00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,900
can tell me if I've got it wrong and

00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,330
you're asking me is there a time when

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,370
computers

00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,930
I insist on I don't mean to make you

00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:13,780
sound like a Luddite by saying it that

00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:15,370
way but I do think there are times when

00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:19,030
software is pretty much done

00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:20,680
yeah right and I think that open source

00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:23,560
is very very good at finding that kind

00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,240
of software and not just commoditizing

00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,430
about making the open source one that

00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,350
done one alright cuz it serves the right

00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:32,260
needs for the right users and that's it

00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:35,590
you know so so the question then becomes

00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:39,340
is the needs of the end user community

00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:41,350
large enough to accommodate more and

00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,060
more programs and applications than all

00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,500
the rest I think the answer is yes I

00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,150
think it'll go in fits and starts though

00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,240
so I don't know if you remember before

00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:51,280
the internet really took hold so I

00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,470
mentioned that that horrific email

00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,080
network that I ran right but it really

00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,790
was the best solution for a Macintosh

00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,080
network at the time and it didn't get

00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:02,230
better until the internet took hold

00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,180
right you know exchange was being

00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:06,460
sampled and stuff but people really

00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,070
weren't into email I mean I had 1,200

00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,230
type a boutique lawyers as my clients

00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,490
they weren't in the email it was that

00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,140
joke you know they'd have their

00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,900
administrative assistant print out their

00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,910
their email we had those guys they exist

00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,220
they still exist today probably but you

00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:23,470
know it'd be really weird now but it was

00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:26,020
just mildly weird back then for a guy

00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:28,510
like me right but it was very normal

00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,940
back then so so there are things I think

00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,830
that happened like so I think that once

00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,070
the United States actually has really

00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:37,360
fast broadband things will change again

00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:39,100
the kinds of applications we preach and

00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,020
I think we're sort of here to talk about

00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,490
that kind of thing right but so I've

00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:44,920
actually had a very good part right now

00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,690
where there's way more demand way more

00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,880
opportunity than there is done

00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:52,540
applications but that's we're talking

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,070
philosophy here there's there's more Pro

00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,930
programmers today than there were 10

00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,920
years ago even though Perl might be

00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,800
perceived as being on the decline

00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,800
because there's such a demand right it's

00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,090
a great time via computer I in in a very

00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,800
strange occurrence I gave a commencement

00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:08,140
speech at a computer science department

00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,470
like last week and the speech was you

00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,790
picked the right career you all did

00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,200
right this is a great time to be a

00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,310
computer scientist this is a great time

00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,620
of you Burma this is a great time to be

00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:20,150
a project manager or a person in

00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:23,270
computers because the demand is is

00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:24,319
Daanish you know and and I know people

00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,299
were worried for a bit that it was all

00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,789
going to other countries but it turns

00:59:26,299 --> 00:59:30,529
out the demand was so big that it cannot

00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:32,750
be filled by the current population of

00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:35,150
humanity that can work a computer the

00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:37,220
way we can't so so I think there were in

00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,960
a very good place and I think that the

00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,970
projects that open source may be a

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,250
spoiler for depending on how you want to

00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:46,279
say it may service that need wholly and

00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,210
completely are so small and there's so

00:59:46,279 --> 00:59:49,339
much more opportunity I think we're a

00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:55,250
good place for 20 more years ask me

00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:58,700
again in 20 years one question okay for

00:59:55,250 --> 01:00:02,359
non-google ayats is there blood for how

00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,650
do you make money out of this magic if I

01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:05,839
were not at Google what would I do

01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,760
I would I would be figuring something

01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,319
out you know I really think there's a

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,670
lot of opportunity right now and I think

01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:12,619
the people who understand open source

01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,079
are more effective and productive and

01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:17,270
are able to create solutions and

01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:19,010
products much faster from the open

01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,150
source base and so you know none of you

01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:24,950
would how many of you were writing your

01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:28,160
own web server yeah you are there's

01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:29,630
probably room for it right but it's like

01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,829
you know not many of you were writing

01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,089
your own web server certainly none of

01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:33,829
you are writing your own firm well maybe

01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:35,029
your firm or people but you know they're

01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:37,549
very few people who are writing their

01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:39,079
own fundamental infrastructure right

01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:41,240
most people are working way above that

01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:42,890
level and that's a very good place to be

01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,200
but I think I'm out of time I'm seeing

01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:47,450
the blinky red light right so I've been

01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,240
asked that you fill out these evaluation

01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:51,559
forms and that'd be really good too so

01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,400
any comments you might have I actually

01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:56,420
will read them because yeah it's funny

01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,670
you know I said be honest with you for

01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,069
the last 10 years I've given talks I've

01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:02,150
never seen an evaluation form but I

01:01:01,069 --> 01:01:03,890
would really welcome them because I know

01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,990
that since we're running this thing I'll

01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:07,730
see them so please take the time to fill

01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,940
them out and thank you for coming

01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,940
