Hi, I'm Carmen Andoh, with Google.

00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,847
I'd like to talk about the Git Contributor Inclusion Summit

00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:22,360
a butterfly effect for open source, diversity, equity, and inclusion.

00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:29,481
In 2020, amid a global pandemic that shone a spotlight on structural inequities

00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:34,538
a Black man named George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis

00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:37,198
not brutally or violently

00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:41,606
but by eight minutes of callous indifference to a Black man's life

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,184
at the hands of a person who was supposed to serve and protect.

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,468
The fallout was far and wide.

00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:51,569
Communities all over the world exploded into protest.

00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,030
In offices and homes

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,087
it sparked conversations about race and justice

00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:01,330
conversations that have been happening in Black communities for decades.

00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:06,715
These made their way into the national dialog over 50 years ago

00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:09,650
in the first civil rights movement of the 1960s

00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:14,387
and were taken up anew six years ago with the start of Black Lives Matter

00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,334
culminating in 2020 as a global racial reckoning

00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:24,006
one that garnered mainstream, worldwide attention.

00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:29,474
These images were taken in Nairobi, Paris, and Cologne, Germany.

00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:31,748
The collage on the lower right

00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:35,408
honors the many Black lives taken at the hands of police

00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:37,886
or the justice system over many years.

00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:40,808
You may find yourself asking

00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:44,202
"What does this have to do with open-source software development?"

00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,279
With this reckoning

00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,355
in order to understand and make sense of these events

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,932
many of us in tech and in open source looked inward

00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:58,596
to see how to effect change in areas of our lives that we had influence over.

00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:00,997
This story is an example

00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:05,792
of how one small group looked to be the change they wished to see in the world.

00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:10,544
This talk is for anyone who wants to make open source

00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:15,524
a place that is more inclusive, representational, and equitable for all.

00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:21,480
This includes developers, maintainers, organizers of events

00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:26,634
or any open-source enthusiast that wants to know where they can start.

00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,268
This talk comes in four parts

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,970
and my goal is to take the diff of where we are and where we need to be

00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:37,392
with a road map of how to get there.

00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:42,458
This includes contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.

00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:45,496
As the descriptions allude

00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,269
these four parts take a journey from a moral, philosophical, societal

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,935
reflective journey into the operational nitty-gritty details

00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,877
because both the vision and the execution details

00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,294
are needed for change.

00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:07,514
In this way, I hope everyone understands how these approaches complement each other.

00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:11,998
To contemplate is to think profoundly and at length.

00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:15,324
In this context, we ask ourselves

00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,820
what is open source?

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,278
How do open-source projects reflect a larger, global society

00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:24,231
and where can they improve?

00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,252
Open source is not just code.

00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,349
It's made by and for people.

00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:33,712
Open source is fundamentally a vision

00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:37,370
for how humans can work together to create works of greater good.

00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,441
For developers and maintainers, that meant looking within projects.

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,374
Both code and products

00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,216
processes, tooling

00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:51,532
and the way project members collaborate and produce the code…

00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,568
open source is people.

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,999
But although open source is people

00:03:58,193 --> 00:03:59,754
it's not everybody.

00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:04,575
This is from the most recent Stack Overflow global Developer Survey.

00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:08,261
We see 7 out of every 10 developers are white.

00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:14,316
This is the survey by gender, which represents and even wider discrepancy.

00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:17,136
Nine out of 10 developers are men.

00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:22,701
The 2020 racial reckoning needed to become, and became

00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:27,646
a larger reckoning on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).

00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,042
From a logical standpoint

00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,728
the representation found in open-source projects

00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:36,126
should closely resemble the demographics of the world

00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,823
yet it does not.

00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:43,524
It is still widely over-represented by men of white or European descent.

00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:47,999
Understanding the reasons behind this over-representation

00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,068
why and how it happens

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,851
is the key to fixing it.

00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:55,322
I like this quote by Craig Owens.

00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,306
"Representation, then, is not—nor can it be—neutral.

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:04,623
It is an act—indeed, the founding act—of power in our culture."

00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,125
And this is where we come to talk about

00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,719
one set of maintainers in one open-source project

00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,510
who came together to improve their DEI.

00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,255
That project is the Git source control management tool.

00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,396
In order to give a bit of context

00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:22,122
I'm going to take a step back to describe Git

00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,940
and its impact on the software development industry.

00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:29,621
I'd like to describe the relationship between Git and Git hosting sites.

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,517
Git is a source control tooling that you install locally on your computer

00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:38,517
to work with burgeoning and changing code in a distributed manner.

00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:43,654
Sites like Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab are code hosting sites

00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:47,490
that also add workflows and other features to work with Git.

00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:50,945
With the rise in popularity of GitHub

00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:52,747
followed by GitLab

00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:57,666
Git has grown to become the de facto tool of source code management

00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,306
in the last five years.

00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,779
It became so standard

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,174
that the developer surveys no longer ask which source control tool is used

00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:08,656
because it's mostly assumed to be Git.

00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:10,837
Why is this relevant?

00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:18,349
Well, this makes Git the foundational tool for 90%+ of the world's software developers.

00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,142
This is extraordinary in terms of mind or market share

00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:26,984
when it comes to technology choice in the stack for developers globally.

00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,097
In terms of influence

00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:34,811
90%+ of the world's estimated 26 million developers use Git

00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:40,013
and Git is developed by a core group of fewer than 100 people.

00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,517
For shaping developer culture, thinking, attitudes, and more

00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:49,335
this group of contributors has enormous influence.

00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:53,046
Git is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy

00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,641
which accepts donations on Git's behalf.

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,158
But a larger donation is found in companies paying their employees to work full time

00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,655
devoted to improving Git.

00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:04,850
These companies include Google

00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:08,912
home to the primary maintainer of Git, Junio Hamano

00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,820
as well as the Git Core Team.

00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:16,998
Employees of GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft, and more also work on Git full time.

00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:19,618
But in terms of representation

00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:24,330
the core contributors to Git were not representative of the wider world at large.

00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:27,928
Similar to the results of the developer demographic surveys

00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:32,664
this small group has almost no racial, ethnic, or gender diversity.

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,465
So, as a first step in contemplating

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,548
this meant that in order for Git to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,790
they need to look at the group that provides this code

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,873
but also the code and the tool itself.

00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:48,809
For tooling

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,959
one simple but powerful change that could be made straight away was terminology.

00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:58,746
In the summer of 2020, a move was made to change several terms

00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:04,146
the most notable being the default branch changed to be called "main."

00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:09,641
GitHub and GitLab made these changes in the fall of 2020.

00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,558
This is part of a broader effort in open source

00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:17,090
to contemplate certain terms as being negative

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,090
or reinforcing negative associations and unconscious bias.

00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,254
Google Open Source blogged about their initiative

00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,157
to have all of Google's projects that are in open source

00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:30,650
numbering in the thousands

00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:35,484
change their technical terminology to omit certain phrases.

00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,900
If you work in open source

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,175
and haven't taken an audit of the terminology used in your project

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,106
even if it is terminology inherited in your project dependencies or upstream

00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:51,596
this is a great first step in making your code and project more inclusive.

00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:55,129
We come to the second part: Preparation.

00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,529
Maintainers at Git Core recognized that

00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,533
they needed to do something beyond terminology

00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:03,851
that terminology was not enough.

00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,661
Looking inward at the lack of diversity in the project contributors I just mentioned

00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:13,851
and also understanding negative associations and unconscious bias

00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:17,119
they decided to look at wider patterns of bias.

00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,553
They also wanted to bring along

00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,147
everyone who played a part in making the Git tool.

00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:28,335
As you see here in this screenshot, one maintainer did just this in June of 2020.

00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:31,438
Git does their discussion on the mailing list

00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:37,427
a plain text email list that can be read publicly at lore.kernel.org/git.

00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:41,867
Here you see a maintainer making a suggestion about

00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,226
organizing a virtual contributor summit

00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:46,102
focused solely on DEI.

00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:49,528
She also recognized the lack of diversity in the group

00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:53,748
which creates perspective gaps to improving said DEI.

00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:57,350
Given we know this group has an enormous influence

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,057
on a key, foundational developer tool

00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,695
Git knew that in order to succeed in a larger way

00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,662
it needed to start with the contributors.

00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,535
As a first stage

00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:10,379
they invited contributors to a virtual summit that

00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,247
instead of talking about a wide array of subjects

00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:17,247
would focus solely on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:22,287
Since that group in and of themselves needed more representation beyond them

00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,359
they organized or they brainstormed

00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:28,009
on ways to get that broader perspective to make change.

00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:31,704
The group would hire and enlist help from outside experts

00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:35,146
focus the event on level-setting and education

00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:39,646
and manage expectations by coming up with pre-reading materials

00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:44,954
to make sure attendees did some work and had a certain level of understanding

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,463
prior to attending.

00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,073
As the event-planning started to happen more

00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:53,489
extra people expressed interest in helping

00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:57,885
and this became a collaboration between Google software engineers

00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:00,243
technical programming managers

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,506
the open source programming office

00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,470
the diversity business partners within Google

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,963
as well as the Microsoft Open Source program's office.

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,430
And as we move from planning to action

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,550
this Part 3 moves from the philosophical and moral imperatives

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,702
to those practicalities of running such an event.

00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:23,693
Depending on the goals you set in the Contemplation stage

00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,171
and the plans you made in the Preparation stage

00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,949
this Action stage can occur in different steps.

00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:33,782
It could be all in one, or in small, gradual steps.

00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,827
A couple of practical tips to let you know how to put an event together

00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,702
and what details not to leave out.

00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:43,340
The first is

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,766
to ensure high trust

00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,549
you should always take time to establish ground rules.

00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:53,237
I'd argue that for every productive event you need ground rules.

00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:57,524
Running an event like this doesn't need a lot of tech.

00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,223
We kept it simple.

00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:03,944
It's appropriate to keep the tooling that the project already uses.

00:12:04,034 --> 00:12:10,480
In this case, the Git project use the plain text email for the mailing list.

00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,526
We also want to make sure that

00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:17,226
we give extra care and thought to accessibility access too.

00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:21,774
In Git's case, they wanted to continue to use that mailing list

00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,299
for discussion and consensus-building.

00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:28,456
Since many of the attendees were Googlers as well as organizers

00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:34,052
we used G Suite tools like Docs, Sheets, Forms, and even Google Draw

00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,330
for planning and executing the event.

00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:42,819
Lastly, we used a self-hosted Jitsi for video conferencing

00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:48,977
at the behest of the attendees who wanted an open-source video-conferencing solution.

00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,237
In fact, at the beginning of planning, we sent out a survey

00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:58,466
asking if people had any strong objections to any kind of tooling that we should use.

00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:02,474
I mention this because how you engage your stakeholders

00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:04,266
and how you build consensus

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,370
is as important as what is stated in the event itself.

00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,846
For all but the biggest open-source projects

00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,959
you're going to have a small scale with contributors.

00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:19,895
Most open-source core teams comprise only a few people.

00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:22,362
Work with those contributors

00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:25,547
that have been involved with the project for a long time.

00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,490
This may not work for every project.

00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:31,148
You need to think carefully about event goals.

00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:34,026
Part of the Git project's goals was to bring together

00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,781
the people who had been with the project for a long time

00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,044
but also try to bring in the right amount of new perspective

00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:43,045
to enlighten the group while keeping the trust high.

00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:48,925
You must also recognize that many open-source projects work asynchronously

00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,675
over many time zones.

00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:55,406
So, this event ended up being two half days

00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,266
or four-and-a-half-hour slots

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,390
that tried to compromise on 15 different time zones.

00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:08,166
Communicating that compromise and making that compromise easier to do

00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:13,684
for example, four hours only in the early hours of the morning for Australia

00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,262
instead of a full eight hours in the middle of the night

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,283
will go a long way to ensuring the success of your event.

00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:26,199
Here are some how-tos and screenshots of artifacts of the event.

00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,227
The left is an event brief

00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:32,946
with the event purpose, objective, and measurable goals

00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:36,762
to be able to understand what it is and why you're doing it

00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:37,810
so the "why"

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,556
followed by tactical strategy —think "who," "what," or "how."

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,740
You can also keep an appendix

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,700
of any communication you had (in our case, the mailing list).

00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:53,616
It will serve as a useful reference document

00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:55,520
or what we call a home base document

00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,712
to come back to over and over again.

00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:01,994
The second document is a Google Form to sign up registrants.

00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:06,084
You can use other tools that you're familiar and comfortable with

00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:07,658
but more importantly

00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:13,692
make sure you understand the tools your attendees are most comfortable with.

00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,551
Here's the agenda, which included

00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:21,080
after much consensus-building and stakeholder engagement

00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,978
training and level-setting on Half Day 1

00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,226
followed by unconference discussion breakout sessions

00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,859
which means they were essentially chosen and voted on by attendees

00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,326
on Half Day 2.

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,566
Again, we did have to corral time zones and availability

00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:41,431
of all the contributors across all the time zones

00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:45,744
and we did that using the browser-based whenisgood.net tool.

00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:52,651
One other bit not shown here is moderator training for discussion leaders

00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:57,359
a group of about a half dozen who volunteered to take the lead in these discussions.

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,852
They all attended a brief, one-hour workshop on how best to facilitate conversations

00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:07,452
approximately one week before the summit.

00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:12,744
For day-of details, we made a Google spreadsheet

00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:18,770
and used that as the place to suggest discussion breakout topics

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,293
and also to have the attendees vote or rate those topics

00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:26,806
and put the highest-rated discussions into the time slots on Half Day 2.

00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,548
The voting mechanism was simple.

00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:35,783
We simply asked the voters to add an asterisk or increment it by one in the second column.

00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:41,765
Again, look for the easiest tool to get the job done for the scale you need.

00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:43,291
Finally

00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,023
all the documents were made available to participants on the site here

00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:50,166
as well as other information for public consumption.

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,943
You can use a lot of this for ideas for your event.

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,428
Lastly, in Action, there were many takeaways from the summit

00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,076
a few listed and grouped here.

00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:06,776
They include the terminology changes that were discussed earlier

00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:12,639
including deadnaming or name-mapping without making deadnames more prominent

00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:15,914
a real challenge for a version control tool.

00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:19,663
Representation, sponsorship, and mentoring

00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,668
for people that need to have better representation.

00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:27,077
The mailing list, or inclusive project communication.

00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:30,464
Accessibility and localization.

00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,189
Code review, including bias

00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:38,154
and ways to make sure you keep it friendly and welcoming in an asynchronous mode.

00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:44,114
Attracting beginner-friendly, non-user, and non-code contributions to the project

00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,682
including valuing them.

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,886
User and contributor documentation.

00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:51,517
And user experience research.

00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,555
Since the time of recording

00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,555
there is now a name-mapping that takes deadnaming into account

00:17:57,555 --> 00:18:01,555
and handles it much better than previous versions of Git.

00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:05,302
The other thing I should say as I wrap up the actions

00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:08,475
is that many of these takeaways are universal among projects.

00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:13,102
What to do with them and when, is key for maintaining.

00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:18,554
As we mentioned maintaining, notes of the summit are linked here.

00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:23,845
You can read the full list of projects and all the things that were discussed.

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,587
Plans for 2021 for Git include

00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:30,749
additional follow-up summits or a summit for contributors

00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:34,596
and a possible larger event with Git's end users.

00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:39,338
I want to come to you with two conclusions

00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:44,396
about planning, preparing, and acting on this event.

00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:49,106
The first is one of my favorite quotes about my job.

00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,643
"Software is never done."

00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:55,399
This describes the cyclical nature of development

00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:59,399
whether it's software development or other types of development.

00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,166
And so diversity, equity, and inclusion, by their nature

00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:07,876
is and always will be a work unfinished

00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:14,108
where a cycle of re-contemplation, more preparation, additional and new action

00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:15,558
and ongoing maintenance

00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:16,930
will always be needed.

00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,599
Lastly, my talk subheading was titled

00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,505
"Contributor Inclusion Summit: A Butterfly Effect for Open Source Diversity

00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,189
Equity, and Inclusion."

00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,762
The butterfly effect is

00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:34,514
a phenomenon where one small act can result in large differences later on.

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,810
When I think of the butterfly effect, I think of this quote by Margaret Mead.

00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:43,153
"Never underestimate the power of a small group of committed people

00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,344
to change the world.

00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:47,183
In fact, it is the only thing that ever has."

00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:52,121
For open-source developers, maintainers, and project contributors

00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:54,111
thank you for changing the world

00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:55,937
