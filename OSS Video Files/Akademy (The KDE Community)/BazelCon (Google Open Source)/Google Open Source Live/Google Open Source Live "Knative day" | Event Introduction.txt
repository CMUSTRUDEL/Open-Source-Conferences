canada

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
enjoying a brisk 56 degree weather too

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,000
cold to ride the bike unfortunately

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680

today we're going to go from zero to a

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,640
hundred in terms of k-native eventing

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,719
first akash and chen will take us from

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
zero to 60 with an overview of k-native

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
eventing

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
starting with the history and advantages

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,680
of microservice architecture

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
to the problems they create to how

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
event-driven architecture and k-native

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,520
specifically

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,200

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,880
nacho and adam will tell us everything

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
we need to know about sources

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,880
a key value to canadian eventing is the

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
ability to benefit from sources

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
published by the larger community in

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,240
this talk we'll walk you through how

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
they work

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,079
and even how you can go about creating

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
your own sources finally grant

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
understanding of the eventing components

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,799
