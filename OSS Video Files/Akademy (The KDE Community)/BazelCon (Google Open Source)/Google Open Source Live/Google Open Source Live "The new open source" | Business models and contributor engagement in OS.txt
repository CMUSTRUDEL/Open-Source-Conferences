Hello and welcome.

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,110
I'm here with Seth Vargo, and we're going to have a chat about open source

00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,340
I'm Kaslin Fields and I'm a developer advocate at Google.

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,600
I focus on Kubernetes, cloud native, DevOps, and all sorts of topics in that area.

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,359
Yeah, and I'm Seth.

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,019
I'm also a developer advocate at Google

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,660
primarily focused on security, but recently I've been working on Exposure Notifications

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,550
which is a tool to help stop the spread of COVID.

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,360
That is a super interesting topic

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,440
and I think we'll talk a little bit about that in a bit.

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,270
But first off, I want to start with...

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,860
We're talking about open source today.

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,980
What kinds of open source projects are you involved with

00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,570
and how did you get started working with open source?

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,809
Yeah, so like I was just saying, today

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,960
honestly, most of my days are spent working on

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,180
Exposure Notifications on the server component.

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,110
So this is a joint effort between Google, Apple, and Microsoft

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,330
to help stop the spread of COVID.

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,330
We have a server.

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,680
The server is open source

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,780
github.com/google/ exposure-notifications-server

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,611
And it's written in Go, which is also an open source project programming language.

00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,500
So there's kind of double dipping there a little bit

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,210
Prior to that, I've worked on a number of open source projects at Google

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,450
including GCR Cleaner and Berglas.

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,970
And then before that, BG, before Google

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,940
I worked at HashiCorp for a number of years

00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,640
which is a company largely based on open source software tools like

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,530
Vagrant, Packer, Serf, Consul, Nomad, Vault.

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,060
I did a lot of work in the Vagrant and Vault ecosystems

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,820
and before that I worked at Chef Software

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,591
which is also a company based on open source

00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:56,700
primarily doing a lot of ruby development and ecosystem development.

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,200
But my first open source project ever was actually

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,580
when I was an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon.

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,880
I wrote a little RubyGem that could query the ISBNdb database

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,950
so that you could look up a textbook by its barcode number for

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,120
a little startup that we were working on that ultimately failed.

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,702
But you live and you learn.

00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:18,819
What about you, Kaslin, how did you get involved?

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,129
Yeah, so I mentioned that I do Kubernetes things.

00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,209
I'm involved in the special interest group within the Kubernetes project

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,189
that's focused on contributor experience

00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:34,239
specifically a team that focuses on kind of internal upstream marketing.

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,129
So I take the things that contributors are doing within the Kubernetes project

00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,299
and I help other contributors see what they're doing

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,999
that can help inspire people to find

00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,680
a new project to work on that they're really interested in.

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,040
It's a great way to learn about all of

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,599
the different types of projects that are going on within Kubernetes.

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,200
It's a broad spectrum of areas and types of projects

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,579
so I'm really excited to get to see all these sorts of broad categories of

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,150
things that people are doing within Kubernetes.

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,029
And I'm also a CNCF ambassador.

00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,859
So that's the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,250
And with them, I do a lot of things to kind of help promote their community

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,230
help kind of organize things.

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,340
I volunteer at conferences and help with webinars and things like that.

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,560
So I do a lot of things that are related to open source community.

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,290
Cool, awesome.

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,879
Which kind of brings up an interesting point that we might want to talk about

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,269
is open source communities, and how does open source work?

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,659
I think in the current situation of the world

00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,299
there's a lot of interesting things that we can learn

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,420
from the way that open source does their work.

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,160
Yeah, for sure.

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,180
I think with the current situation with COVID, traditional nine-to-five

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,769
and commuting to and from an office every day is pretty much nonexistent.

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,830
And for that reason, many people have reinvented the way that they work

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,590
whether that's because you have family or loved ones at home or new pets

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,909
or new furry friends, you may be working at really odd hours

00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,239
two hours here two hours there instead of this normal chunk of time.

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,770
And because of that, I think we're starting to see open source software flourish

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,330
because open source is designed and these communities operate in

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,590
a way that's highly asynchronous.

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,330
Even if you look at a lot of those source code platforms we have like GitHub and GitLab

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,949
They're all designed around asynchronous communication comment threading

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,270
multiple approvers so that there's no single points of failure.

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,539
And that's really enabling open source to flourish in this environment

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:49,800
as opposed to maybe a traditional waterfall software method that requires very rigorous

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,450
points in time and check points for things to move throughout a system.

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,199
And I also think that this situation is giving people

00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,180
opportunity to explore contributing to open source more

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,560
because they might be branching outside of their regular day-to-day work.

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,990
Some people are finding that they're more productive actually by working from home

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,580
or working outside of the office with less distractions.

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,930
And that's giving them additional time to explore open source projects

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,169
and open source communities and ways that they might get involved.

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:24,060
Yeah, an important thing that I want to point out there that I am involved

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,199
a lot with in my role with Kubernetes is that these projects are often global

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,979
especially Kubernetes, such a large project.

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:37,509
They have the opportunity for people all over the world to contribute to Kubernetes.

00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,669
And that can pose all sorts of different challenges that

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,720
a lot of folks might be dealing with today as well in their work.

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,330
Since everyone is staying home

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,310
you might have to collaborate with people in different time zones

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,699
and all sorts of different places in the world.

00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,300
And a lot of open source communities are just used to that.

00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,479
They do it all the time and they're familiar with all of

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,669
the challenges that poses.

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,669
And they have come up with their various solutions.

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:08,759
A lot of the time, there's a meeting in my morning

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,580
in my evening that hits different time zones and all sorts of programs

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,099
and kind of leaders situated in different parts of the world that all work together

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,130
which is really cool to see.

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,849
Yeah, I think open source has been remote largely from the beginning

00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:31,669
because of the way that contributors come from different backgrounds and time zones

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,129
and countries and languages that...

00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,770
Not only has there not really been an interruption to

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,460
the velocity at which open source software is being developed

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,790
but I think it's quite the opposite.

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,690
I think we've seen an acceleration as more and more people get involved.

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,770
Yeah, which brings up another really interesting point

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,040
which is who contributes to open source?

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,430
Who are all these people across the world?

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,919
So, honestly, anyone can contribute to open source.

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,639
Oftentimes we talk about open source software and we talk about the "S" word

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599
the software, and that tends to lead to developer or software engineer.

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,090
And that's something I really want to dispel.

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,949
It's like you don't have to be a software engineer

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,539
and you don't have to be writing code in order to contribute to open source.

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,349
You don't have to be a software engineer to write code

00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,510
and you don't have to be writing code to contribute to open source.

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,491
I can't think of a single open source project

00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:24,219
that wouldn't gladly accept a documentation, a fix

00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,120
or especially, we were talking about global climate earlier

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,289
a translation of documentation into another language so that you have localization.

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:34,999
All of these things are incredibly welcome in open source projects

00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:40,749
and don't require you to write code or be an engineer.

00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:45,310
There's also a ton of other things that build an open source community

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,150
things like logos and graphics and swag and pre-COVID meetups

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,970
and local human-to-human interaction.

00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,030
I think a really good example of this is Go.

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,539
Go, the programming language, is also an open source project, an open source community.

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,919
They have this cute little mascot.

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
It's a gopher.

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,050
And there have been folks from the community who have taken that

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,180
and turned it into amazing, cute little artwork

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,689
that people have stickers on their laptops and backgrounds on their computers

00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,099
And that dramatically improved the continuity of community

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:26,779
but didn't involve, to the best of my knowledge, writing any Go code.

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,870
And these are just a few of the ways that you can get involved in open source.

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,010
Obviously, you can write code.

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,520
Nothing's stopping you from doing that.

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,850
But I really just like whenever I hear people say, like, "Oh, I'm just a tech writer.

00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,730
"I can't really contribute to open source."

00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,870
That's really not the case.

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,620
I would argue that your contributions might even be more important than code

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,590
contributions, especially for a more mature project

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,640
because ultimately, you're starting to get people who aren't directly familiar with

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,130
the technology, and they really need that documentation in order to be successful.

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,030
And also with the current situation of the world

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,850
there are so many people at home right now who are trying to learn new languages

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,080
learn all sorts of different technologies and tools.

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,640
And a lot of the information that they're getting comes from the documentation.

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,800
It's a primary source of knowledge on any open source projects.

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,900
So those contributions get a lot of use.

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,180
They're very visible contributions, and they're very highly valued.

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,570
So that's a really important way that people can contribute

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,280
even if they're not as comfortable doing code.

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,120
And maybe if they want to learn how to code or they want to start contributing to

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,230
a project in those kinds of ways

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,030
documentation is also a great place to start because you can learn so much about what

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,200
the project does and how it works and the use cases of it

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,260
and that can be great for informing your efforts as you start to contribute to

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,990
the project in code as well, if you're interested in that.

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah, and if you are just going to jump straight into code

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,750
another thing that's really important is to read the contributing guidelines

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,130
and do take some time to understand the goals of the project.

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,130
Right?

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,840
If you're contributing in an open source project that

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,530
is designed to open and close a garage door

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,970
and you contribute functionality that makes it also cook you an omelet.

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,840
That's probably what we call scope creep

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,400
and you really want to stay true to the core principles of the project.

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,680
That may include things like a code of conduct in the contributing guidelines.

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,500
It may include the things more on the legal side

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,900
like signing a contributor license agreement.

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,881
But you also just want to make sure that your change or your contribution

00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,840
or suggestion is in line with the goals of the project.

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,710
And some projects intentionally limit their scope to be very, very small

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,290
either because they don't have the resources and staffing to support

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,380
a broader scope or because they really follow the Unix philosophy

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,940
and just want to do one thing and do it really well.

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,210
Yeah, and that's an important point to mention, too, is that

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,920
open source has been doing this kind of virtual distributed thing for a long time

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,380
so there's a lot that businesses and groups can learn about, how to collaborate from

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,990
the processes that these open source communities have in place already.

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,380
-Yeah, for sure.

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,390
-Yeah, and so I'd like to talk

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,080
a little bit more about what you're doing with your project right now

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,260
to address COVID-19.

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,910
Can you tell us more about that?

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,450
Yeah, so...

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh, boy, there's so much.

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,820
So there's two main components that I'm involved in on the day-to-day.

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,380
We have two server components.

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,150
Both of them are open source on GitHub.

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,920
The first is the actual Exposure Notifications server.

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,300
This is the server that your Android

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,450
or iOS device actually publishes temporary exposure keys to.

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,100
And then we have a verification server

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,960
also open source, that is typically run by, like, a public health authority

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,510
which verifies that when your device is uploading these keys that you were actually

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,780
seen by a medical professional or clinic

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,050
or if you did a self-diagnosis with a test at home

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,130
that there's metadata attached to that.

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,710
But the entire system is open source for two reasons.

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,070
First is we wanted people, and particularly security researchers

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,970
to be able to look and find any vulnerabilities we have in the code.

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,550
We wanted people to be able to see that we're working in the open

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,540
and that we're not hiding anything.

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,180
And the second is that we're really focused on building a privacy-preserving system.

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,230
And this is where, again, open source being open and anyone can go look at

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,500
the code is very important.

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,380
If you're concerned about privacy

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,770
you can actually go audit the code

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,930
the code that is running on device and the code that is running in the server

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,640
and you can see that we're following privacy-preserving principles.

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,690
And this is really important

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,230
and one of the ways that I don't think we talk about very much in open source

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,170
is the code is available and you can look at it.

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,460
There's lots of security talks around it.

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,150
But there's also the privacy bit as well.

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,010
You can look at this code and you can see: Is it phoning home?

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,900
Is it publishing metrics?

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,520
Is it logging my IP address somewhere?

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,640
And all of that's available and visible out in the open with the work that we're doing

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
on

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
the Exposure Notifications server.

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,720
And then we have a very similar thing on the client side.

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,960
There's a sample reference architecture and application available on the Android side

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,280
but I'm not directly involved in that

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,310
so I can't speak too much about what that looks like.

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,000
That is such an interesting space

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,580
and I think it's so interesting that you talk about

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,860
privacy and open source and the opportunity for people who are using

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,580
the software to actually go and see what the privacy implications of using it are.

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,610
And I think that poses an interesting question

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,230
about businesses using open source, too.

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,440
Businesses have all sorts of privacy

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,280
and governance concerns that they have to deal with.

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,160
So it can be surprising sometimes to people to hear that

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,620
a lot of businesses these days are using open source software

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,920
and also sometimes paying people to contribute to open source software.

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,840
So can you talk more about how that works and why businesses do that?

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,020
Yeah, so I think businesses have learned, for better or worse

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,890
that there's a growing need

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,560
and a growing trend where these businesses just refuse to operate closed source software

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,830
and this is interesting because in the past

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,180
an organization would just buy an off-the-shelf software appliance

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,440
they would run it, give it an IP address, and boom, it works.

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,880
But then what they would find is it was very difficult to upgrade that software

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
It was very opaque.

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,750
They had no visibility into how it worked.

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,920
They couldn't extend it.

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,130
They couldn't go integrate it with the HR system

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,970
or the social media system because there was no visibility into the system.

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,640
It was entirely opaque, no transparency.

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,080
And worst case scenario, if the company that provided that software no longer existed

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,250
they couldn't get the support that they needed

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,810
and oftentimes these were critical core business functionality.

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,040
So oftentimes businesses are looking to open source because it provides a safety net.

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,730
They know that if the company or the community that's supporting

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,840
the software under the hood were to go away

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,660
they have the ability to ingress that code internally and build

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,590
a team around it to continue cultivating it and making it work

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,980
for their business and maintaining continuity of business.

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,550
This creates incentives for businesses to also contribute back to these projects.

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,950
So I guarantee you, and hopefully Tim Harkin doesn't yell at me

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,280
that Kubernetes did not work for everyone when we released 0.5, 0.7 to the world.

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,080
And a lot of the contributions that we've gotten

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,210
for critical functionality actually came from proposals

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,030
and contributions from non-core contributors

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,860
people at other companies that were trying to

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,930
use Kubernetes at scale and production

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,210
and they were hitting either bugs or missing functionality.

00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,540
So because these businesses want open source software

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,760
and they want to be able to contribute and extend

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,220
they're also incentivized to contribute directly

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,790
and then everyone benefits from those contributions.

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,860
And they make these contributions using their engineering talent

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,130
either part-time or full-time to contribute to these open source projects.

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,890
And even at Google, we have the ability to go contribute to open source projects.

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,860
We can request approval through our open source programs office

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,970
and we have 10 and 20 percent projects.

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,020
But we also have Googlers who are employed full-time to work on open source projects.

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,540
Kubernetes and Go are two really good examples.

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,950
Also Istio, where we have Googlers

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,540
whose full-time job is to go work in open source software.

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,420
Yeah, that's a really important thing that

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,380
a lot of people who are just getting started learning about open source might not know

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,900
about is that there are people who start doing open source in their free time outside

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,940
of their work.

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,010
It could be completely unrelated to their normal work.

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,220
But then there are also people who do open source as their jobs

00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,010
or as part of their jobs.

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,070
So could you talk a little more about that?

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:08,559
Yeah, so there's...

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,780
There's people who are employed full-time to do open source

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,160
and they're typically employed by a person or a foundation who supports that work.

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,689
There is a new funding model that's starting to emerge where people are self-funded.

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,180
GitHub has a program called GitHub sponsors.

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,990
There's services like Patreon and even just Venmo

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,390
where you can ask people to donate or make contributions to pay your salary

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,530
so that you can work at open source as an independent.

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,860
There was actually an article

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,200
a few weeks ago about someone who was making over one hundred thousand dollars

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,730
a year using GitHub sponsors as an independent developer

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,980
so you can actually make this profitable.

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,830
Some people are working for a company and the company pays them.

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,410
This is part of their salary, and some people are doing it on a volunteer basis

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,030
especially in light of COVID.

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,100
People are working odd hours.

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,710
Like I said earlier, the nine-to-five is kind of dead.

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,861
So maybe you're contributing to an open source project

00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:02,730
in the evenings or on the weekends

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,511
Maybe you're learning a new language and you've found a project that's using it.

00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:09,600
And that's a great way to marry those two things that you're exploring.

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,380
And when you're doing that

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,300
I think another reason that people contribute to open source is it's more than code.

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Right?

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
There's a community around it

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,480
whether that's Slack or Discord or DISCUS or Gitter and all these various chat forums.

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,160
Ultimately, open source communities are a community and they're a network.

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,870
And some people are feeling a little bit uncertain in their job security.

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,500
We've seen a lot of layoffs, and a lot of people are getting involved in open source

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,770
because, and speaking from personal experience

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,660
you can actually get a job working in open source.

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,780
You can network with companies and people at companies who can give you referrals.

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,200
And if you're a hiring manager at a company that has headcount and is actively hiring

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,110
going and looking at open source projects and finding people who are doing

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,210
the work that you think is valuable to your company

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,200
is a great way to build a list of potential candidates

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,320
and get them into an interview loop.

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,570
So I think we're also seeing a little bit of an explosion with open source there

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,920
because it does give people a bit of a résumé and it gives people some visibility

00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,640
and allows them to network.

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,020
And you learn a whole lot more about how people work with one another

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,990
and their technical ability, whether that's coding or writing

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,300
or communication through these projects

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,500
far more than you could ever get in a 30-minute or an hour-long interview.

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,950
Yeah, it's an amazing way to build your résumé and kind of show

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,240
the kinds of work that you can do and that you're interested in.

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,070
So it's been a really valuable resource for a lot of folks.

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,720
Any last words that you want to share, Seth?

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,800
I guess, besides Kubernetes, what's a kind of up-and-coming

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,710
open source project that you're really excited about, Kaslin?

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,780
Oh wow.

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,140
What am I interested in with open source right now?

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,170
You know, I've been looking a lot at service meshes lately.

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,260
The various technologies involved with service meshes: Envoy, Linkerd, Istio

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,450
all of those types of things are really interesting to me.

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,350
So I'm excited to get into those more.

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,170
That's something that I really want to get involved with.

00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,170
Awesome.

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,550
Yeah, and you?

00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,470
So I've been following...

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,160
There's a new technology called Cadence from

00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,680
a company called Temporal that was spun out of Uber

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,900
and they're doing this workflows as code thing, that I think is really interesting.

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,480
I think it's really ahead of the curve, and they have some really cool technology.

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,340
But the cool part to me is like the community that they've been able to build.

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,100
They have a very vibrant stock channel

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,420
very active GitHub and very active Discord community

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,570
for a relatively niche tool right now.

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,400
And it's really good to see their founders are directly interacting with the community.

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,460
And I think they're just doing a really good job of building a healthy

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,900
open source community, and it's also a business on top of that.

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,240
Yeah, there's so many different types of open source projects out there.

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,830
I think there's something for just about anyone to get excited about.

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,830
-Yeah.

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,830
-Yeah.

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,890
So I hope everyone learned something.

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,050
I hope that you're excited about open source

00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,760
