Hi everyone

00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,888
and welcome to the Product Inclusion at Google session.

00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:17,424
My name is Annie Jean Baptiste and I lead product inclusion at Google.

00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,461
And my name is Liana Aihara

00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,622
and I lead product inclusion for platforms and ecosystems.

00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:26,313
At Google, we talk a lot about building products for everyone.

00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:29,809
But we also believe it's important to build products with everyone

00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,185
because you can't assume you know what someone needs without asking them.

00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:35,913
It's critical that teams ask "Who else?"

00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,652
Who else needs to be in the room?

00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,400
Who else needs to be at the table so that we can collaborate and co-create

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,017
with voices that have historically been at the margins?

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,558
Google's mission is to organize the world's information

00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:50,045
and make it universally accessible and useful.

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:52,357
That means no matter where you are in the world

00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:54,373
who you love, how much money you make

00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:57,849
what color your skin is, or any of the things that make you you

00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:01,364
you should feel Google is helpful to you in the moments that matter most.

00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,697
So, product inclusion is really about not just building for some

00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,462
but building for billions of people all over the world.

00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:11,082
Product inclusion is unique

00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:15,604
because it brings 12 dimensions of diversity and the intersections of those dimensions

00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:16,514
to the table.

00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:19,653
It builds on amazing work like accessibility work

00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:23,761
but again, looking at intersections of multiple dimensions of diversity

00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,720
and how that affects the user's experience.

00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:29,270
You're seeing some of the dimensions of diversity on this slide

00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:33,163
things like gender, race, age, ability, and more.

00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:37,635
Using myself as an example, I'm a Black woman who's also left-handed.

00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:39,594
It's not like I'm Black on Monday

00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:42,146
left-handed on Tuesday, and a woman on Wednesday!

00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:47,346
All of these things are part of who I am and they affect how I move through the world

00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:50,511
how the world interacts with me, and how I interact with products.

00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,805
So, if I'm using scissors, for example

00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:56,100
being left-handed is the only thing that's going to be predominant.

00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:00,864
But if I'm trying to take a photo, being Black and a woman can intersect.

00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:04,888
Product inclusion is an end-to-end system

00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:07,401
so it's not just a checklist or point in time.

00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:11,928
We try to encourage teams to make sure that they're thinking about product inclusion

00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:14,521
at critical points in the product design process.

00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:17,521
What you're seeing here are what we call inflection points

00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:21,749
or points where teams can really be proactive about bringing that inclusive lens.

00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,758
Teams can come in at any point but we really try to prioritize

00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:28,161
bringing product inclusion in as early as possible

00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,800
so we can take learnings at each of the phases

00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:36,020
and build on them so it cascades through a truly helpful product at the end.

00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:40,931
We've also found there are four points teams keep coming back to time and time again

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,105
and those are the ideation, user research and design

00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:47,601
user testing, and marketing phases, which we'll talk about a little bit later.

00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,782
It's also important to talk about the business case for inclusion.

00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:56,241
There's a misconception that under-represented groups don't have power

00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,720
and that's simply not true.

00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:02,112
What you're seeing here are some stats around different under-represented groups.

00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:06,516
For example, there are 1 billion people in the world with a permanent disability.

00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,261
We're seeing trillions of dollars in purchasing power

00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,567
from Black and Hispanic Latinx consumers.

00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:15,447
And there are 700 million people who are coming online in the next few years

00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,851
from places like Nigeria.

00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:21,508
So, it really behooves any business or organization to think about

00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:24,125
how they bring those perspectives, voices, and needs

00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,102
of these historically under-represented users

00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:29,353
into the center and really highlight them in product design.

00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:30,320
As I mentioned

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,854
there are four main points in the product design process

00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:35,009
that we've really focused on with product teams.

00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,144
This is done because, over a year

00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:39,607
we did some research on the business case for inclusion

00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:43,036
and we found that these were points that were really impactful

00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:46,796
in the output of our product teams and for our products and services

00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:50,180
and those are the ideation, user research and design

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,624
user testing, and marketing phases.

00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:58,124
We found that teams that were acting with an inclusive lens

00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,909
did so at at least two of the four process points.

00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,524
So, that may be ideation and marketing, that may be user research and user testing

00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:09,019
but I think that signals that it's not just a box to check.

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,249
We really want teams to think holistically about product inclusion

00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:15,161
and think holistically about their product design process

00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,786
and how they can make it more inclusive and equitable.

00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:23,015
We also found that both under-represented and majority groups

00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,365
prefer inclusive marketing and product design.

00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,488
This may be surprising to some

00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,838
and they may think that only under-represented groups

00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,453
want to see themselves reflected accurately and beautifully.

00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:36,801
But actually, what we found was that the majority of users wanted to see that.

00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,477
So, I think we'll continue to see trends like this

00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:44,411
where consumers are expecting brands to reflect the beautiful diversity

00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,660
of the world around us.

00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,581
We also found that, regardless of makeup

00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,545
teams that proactively think about product inclusion

00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,471
are intentional about setting goals

00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,212
can create more inclusive products

00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,694
regardless of their team makeup.

00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,560
I think this is very encouraging

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,286
because even if teams are working to get to representation

00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,747
that accurately reflects the world around us

00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:08,093
they can still build more inclusive products.

00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,491
They just have to be intentional, proactive about it

00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:15,037
and really think about accountability for themselves and their teams.

00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:20,033
Now we'll go on to some examples of what product inclusion looks like in action.

00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:23,341
The first one is our Black-owned business attribute

00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,358
which is part of our racial justice workstreams.

00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:29,409
When a business wants it known that they're Black-owned

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:34,794
they're able to do this and have this icon on Google Search and our other properties.

00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,784
This is really exciting because people can celebrate

00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:42,080
highlight, and traffic these different Black-owned businesses.

00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:44,493
We've also seen a lot of work done

00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:46,933
to make sure that all skin tones render accurately.

00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:51,261
So, here's a quick video of the work we've done with Google Camera.

00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,002
<i>Pictures tell stories.</i>

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,349
<i>It doesn't really matter if it's a selfie</i>

00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:58,737
<i>or if it's a portrait that somebody is taking of another person.</i>

00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,333
<i>You are sharing in that human moment.</i>

00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,167
Let's take a picture of you two.

00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,421
One, two, threeâ€¦

00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,561
Oh, he's too dark.

00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:16,479
<i>So, this is where the discussion started.</i>

00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,814
Here, just use my phone; it's got a better sensor.

00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:23,196
Better sensor? What does that even mean?!

00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,613
<i>Color training is an extremely complicated process.</i>

00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,852
<i>When we look at images</i>

00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:31,151
<i>what we try to do is figure out how much of a difference there is</i>

00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,994
<i>between, let's say, a reference image</i>

00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:37,440
<i>and the image we are actually trying to quantify.</i>

00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:40,470
We were running some tests on a product

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,751
and it was the proximity sensor we were testing.

00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:45,487
We said, "Oh, it looks like it does 60 centimeters."

00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,104
Then we looked at each other and said, "We're both White."

00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:53,133
The technology itself, as many people will say, is not racist.

00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,519
It's just that it wasn't tested properly

00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,242
to make sure that the designers weren't unconsciously biased.

00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,519
Hey, there's an entire world out there

00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,522
and we want to make sure this works for everybody!

00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:10,167
I love the fact that we get to influence cameras

00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,281
that we get to share those experiences of life in motion.

00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,452
To me that is what imaging is about.

00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:19,525
It is a vehicle to express humanity.

00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:25,172
Let's take a picture of you two. One, two, threeâ€¦

00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:33,244
Thanks, Annie. Those are great examples.

00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:39,518
I'd like to dig into what's involved in delivering an inclusive camera experience

00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:44,324
and to do that I want to use the work that's taking place in the Android team.

00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:51,230
They've embarked upon this multi-year journey to systematically increase face diversity

00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:56,465
with a goal of providing more inclusive face detection.

00:07:56,861 --> 00:08:03,152
To understand their goal of face detection is to realize that for digital photography

00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:08,381
face detection really can impact how skin tone is rendered

00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:12,774
subject focus, and even exposure metering.

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,893
The way they did this was to systematically look at

00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:22,348
how they're testing both the front- and rear-facing cameras

00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:26,146
and to come up with a consistent approach to testing.

00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:31,307
You can see in the upper right-hand corner, this was their original starting test.

00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:37,171
What they realized was that you didn't have consistent results over time

00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:40,709
to be able to detect faces in that scene

00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,089
and so they neutralized the background

00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:47,920
they neutralized the clothing that the subjects wore

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,923
and then they also increased the size of the faces that comprised the scenes.

00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:56,697
With this consistent framework for measurement

00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:02,062
they started to layer in different dimensions of diversity such as gender, race

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,758
looking at physical attributions such as hair or glasses, accessories

00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,476
and most recently in Android R

00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:15,125
they incorporated age diversity as part of the scenes for testing.

00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:19,769
These tests are then carried out

00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,356
by all of the OEMs that build products on Android

00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:27,109
and what you have then is an increasing performance

00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,008
and an improvement in the ecosystem over time.

00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:37,887
When we think about product inclusion, there are three principles that hold true.

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,844
The first principle is "Address the user."

00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:46,686
What we're talking about here is really understanding the 12 dimensions of diversity

00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,469
that Annie mentioned earlier

00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,104
and really thinking about

00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:52,896
how they come together for users and the product.

00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:56,255
We want to think very holistically about the user

00:09:56,255 --> 00:10:00,905
and understand how historically marginalized users

00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,224
can be brought to the center

00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:07,213
and be part of our focus when we're developing products.

00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,371
The second principle is "Start with equity"

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,403
and there are a couple of things we want to keep in mind

00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,470
when we think about this principle.

00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:20,291
This principle is really about ensuring that

00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,505
at every stage of the product development lifecycle

00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:28,609
equity and product inclusion are a real focus for us

00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:30,544
and not just an afterthought.

00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:34,280
How we activate this second principle

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,632
is about understanding who's represented in the product

00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,110
and, more importantly, who's not

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,087
and asking who else we need to bring to the table

00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:47,550
to really influence the design direction

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,549
and the decisions we're making about the product.

00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,670
In order to do that

00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:57,902
we need to understand the critical user journeys for the product

00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,382
the key performance indicators

00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:03,769
and we need to be able to measure performance

00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:08,973
and how different users actually interact with the product

00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:14,793
and how well or not so well they're succeeding

00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:20,004
in the kinds of outcomes we intend for them to experience.

00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:24,857
The last principle is "Continually test."

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,457
We all have these initial assumptions about the product and how it will land

00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:35,354
and we want to be able to measure how the product actually lands

00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:39,457
and then we also want to be able to refine the product over time

00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:43,343
based on feedback we receive from users in the field.

00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,867
When we think about product inclusion

00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:53,998
it's not something a single individual or a single team can do.

00:11:54,242 --> 00:12:00,611
It's really about a commitment and a value that takes place across the entire company.

00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:05,720
It's a commitment to intention, if you will

00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:10,326
and really the intention to stop and listen

00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:16,033
and, more importantly, to take action on the feedback you receive from individuals.

00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:20,627
What we found is that when you focus on

00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:23,857
and center on these under-represented voices

00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:27,415
the end product is beneficial for everyone.

00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,655
