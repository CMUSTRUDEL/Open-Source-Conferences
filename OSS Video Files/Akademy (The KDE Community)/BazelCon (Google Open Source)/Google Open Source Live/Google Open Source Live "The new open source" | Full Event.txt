00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,200

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:19,840
and with that let's go ahead and get

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:19,840
started so megan let's take it away

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
hi i'm megan bird sanicky and i'm a

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
manager

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,120
at google's open source programs office

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,320
and i'm so excited that you're here

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,280
to learn about being a leader in open

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
source

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,320
and i just want to thank you for making

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
time for this important topic

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
because when we have more leaders in our

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
open source projects they become

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
healthier and we all end up making

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,120
a greater impact together so today i'm

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,680
going to cover

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,919
what is leadership and how can we

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,080
strengthen our leadership skills

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,440
and i'm going to provide some tips that

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,919
you can start using today

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
to be the leader that you need in open

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
source

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,720
so hopefully that sounds great and why

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
don't we get started with a story

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
that does a pretty good job illustrating

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,479
what leadership looks like in open

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,400
source

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,520
a few years ago i was working on a

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
project

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,960
where we wanted to improve the

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,880
contributor experience and we were

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,479
interviewing all kinds of contributors

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
to get their

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,759
um their history and what worked and

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
what didn't work

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
and one story always comes to mind it's

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,120
a common story

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,440
this person wanted to contribute make

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,680
their first contribution to the project

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,960
and they went to the forums they went to

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,120
the issue cues

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,720
and they found that it was a very

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
intimidating process

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
people were a little aggressive in these

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,400
different channels

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,160
and they were talking um at a higher

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
level than what a newcomer

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
might be used to and so this person just

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
did not know how to engage and didn't

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
feel

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
comfortable starting the process for

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
contributing

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,720
and unfortunately they waited an entire

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,400
year before they made their first commit

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,560
which is really unfortunate but they

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
realized the situation they were in they

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,039
had a goal

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,199
and they took the right steps to

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,240
move forward they reached out to a

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
mentor

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,919
and asked this volunteer if they would

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,319
provide help

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,520
and of course this volunteer did a great

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,000
job and

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,759
this contributor made their first commit

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
and because of a learning mindset

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,800
they contributed again and again and

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
again

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
and today this contributor is one of the

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
top

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,960
contributors for this project which just

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,479
is amazing

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,120
but it's also just a real shame because

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,120
this project was losing a lot because of

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
these experiences that were happening in

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,919
these forums

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,080
i mean with just this contributor alone

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,599
they lost 400 commits

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,720
a year and then how many contributors

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,720
did they lose because

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
people just couldn't break through the

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,080
way this one contributor did

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,160
and the answer is just too many and it

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
doesn't have to be this way

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,879
it people don't want it to be this way

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
it's just that often many people

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
step up to help and open source as you

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
do

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
but they don't realize they're actually

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
stepping into leadership roles

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,039
and it's not identified that way and

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
it's not clear how to

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,400
conduct yourself when you're in these

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,919
leadership roles and it can start to get

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
a little messy and confusing for

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,960
everyone

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
and that's why i like to provide this

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,840
kind of training so people are

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,240
more self-aware of how to conduct

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,639
themselves how to lead others how to get

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
things

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,039
done in a healthy way with an open

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,519
source

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
and so i'd love to just use the story to

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,640
kind of unpack

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,040
what leadership is because there's a lot

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,519
of leadership stories in here

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,120
so the first one is who were the leaders

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,959
in this story

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,360
and the answer is the forum moderator

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120
the people working in the issue cues

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
they were helping but they were also

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,920
leading they had

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,160
great influence over the project and

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,800
what was happening in these channels

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,839
the other leader was the mentor a

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
volunteer

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,200
who gave up time and helped this person

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
with

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
achieving their goal the other person

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320
who was a leader which might be a little

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
surprising

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
is the contributor because they had to

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,560
leave themself

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
to get a positive outcome and to achieve

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
a goal

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
and so i'm going to explore what that

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
means to be

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,240
an individual leader a little bit more

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,640
in this

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
session because at the end of the day

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,200
it's all of us

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
individuals working in open source and

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
we all have to know how to lead

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
ourselves towards a good positive

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,640
outcome

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,360
so what is leadership there's a lot of

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,600
definitions

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,920
there's not one specific one but this is

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
one that i like a lot which is

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
that leadership is a process of social

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,760
influence

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,320
which maximizes the efforts of others

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,440
towards the achievement of a goal

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,360
so it is about influencing bringing

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
people along in a journey

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
so that they want to do something with

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
you and

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,680
achieving something together something

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,360
they all want to achieve together

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,360
that's ultimately what leadership is

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and leadership is sometimes better

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,079
defined by what

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,160
it is not so leadership is not a title

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,600
it's not a role you don't need to be a

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,040
ceo vp

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,800
whatever title um you know project lead

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,680
in order to be a leader

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,480
anyone can lead it's also not a specific

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,680
personal

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,839
personality type so you don't need to be

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,519
really outgoing in order to be a leader

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
there's lots of introverts who lead as

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,120
well

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
it's also important important to point

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,399
out that leadership is

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
not management management is about

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,640
making sure everyone's following

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,640
policies and process and rules and

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,000
budgets and things like that

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,959
leadership is different and it is

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,480
not about power it is not about getting

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,000
people to do things because you have

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,600
power or authority

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
it's truly about influence

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
and there are different kinds of

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,519
leadership types there's

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,360
leading organizations so in a company

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
that might be a ceo and a project it

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
might be the project lead

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,600
could be an executive director at a

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,399
foundation for an open source project

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,760
and there's leading others so managers

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,160
lead others on a team

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,519
or product managers work across many

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
teams to

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
build and release a product in open

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
source

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,640
you have someone who might be in charge

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,040
of all of the forum moderators or the

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
issue

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,240
cues or the mentors

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,680
and then the third one is leading

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
yourself

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,360
and this is what the contributor was

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,320
this is some you know this is all of us

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
trying to figure out how do we achieve

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,240
something

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,839
how do we influence others to help us

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
along the way

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,680
just like the contributor used the

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,720
mentor help had the mentor

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,240
help him along the way and

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
it's a really important thing to know

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,880
how to lead yourself

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,839
because um you really can't lead

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,200
others or an organization until you can

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
lead yourself

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,399
and that's because the more people

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,480
you're responsible

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
responsible for more goals you're

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,279
responsible for

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,639
the more stressful it is and so if you

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,760
can't stay calm

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,000
and give people the calm direction

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,880
that they need you're just not going to

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,519
cut it as a leader and so

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,040
because of all of our individual efforts

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,720
and open source i'm going to focus a lot

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,720
today on how to lead yourself

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,160
so what do leaders do so looking at

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,079
this one contributor uh you can see

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,600
that leaders do many things and you can

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,880
see that the contributor did many of

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,519
these things as well

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,760
so you shape a vision you translate that

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,600
vision into a clear strategy

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,600
you get others to help you achieve it

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
you focus on a measurable result so you

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
all know when you've achieved it

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,480
together

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,760
and you foster innovation and learning

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
throughout the process so

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,240
you're constantly taking insights from

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,519
all these people you've brought together

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,480
and as you're doing this you're able to

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
lead yourself

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,240
you're able to really self-regulate your

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
emotions

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
i'll talk some more about that and the

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
contributor very much

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
did this had a vision of contributing

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,880
with a

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,240
goal of one commit and the strategy was

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,880
to go get help

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,839
and he recruited a mentor to go do that

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,680
and there was a goal it was one

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,760
contribution and he did have a learning

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
mindset and he was able to do this again

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
and again

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,199
and that's what made him be a top

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,920
contributor and that's what leaders do

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,839
and they need a lot of skills in order

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,920
to do it and if you look at this list

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,880
from some harvard business review

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
research

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,120
you can see that the skills required

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
range from inspiring and motivating

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,519
others

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,639
communication collaboration

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,320
you don't really see technical skills to

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,800
be a good leader does not mean you need

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
to be

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,120
a great coder great mentor you just need

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
to know how to

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,360
work with others through influence

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
and actually more research shows that

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
leadersh

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,600
two-thirds of leadership depends on

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,440
emotional intelligence that's

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
really the skills that you need to be a

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
leader

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,880
and so if you want to lead yourself you

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,079
want to lead others

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,199
you ultimately need to work on emotional

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,639
intelligence

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,440
so let's take a look at that

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,920
so simply put emotional intelligence is

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,320
being able to understand your emotions

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,240
in a moment whether no crazy no matter

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,199
how crazy that moment is

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,160
and the effect you have on others and

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,160
the ability

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,320
to understand them and their emotional

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,880
state and influence them

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,440
so that you all have a positive outcome

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,040
together

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,440
and emotional intelligence is a

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,360
big thing to unpack but and there's many

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,320
factors that make up emotional

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
intelligence

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,800
but the two key ones are self-awareness

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,680
and self-regulation

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
self-awareness is really being in the

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
now

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,600
being present knowing how you're

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,839
reacting to something

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,680
and self-regulation is saying like i

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,079
know how i feel right now

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
i'm gonna adjust to have the best

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,880
outcome possible

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
so a great example is you've just had a

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,680
rough day you're trying to

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,639
work with people maybe it's um through

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,639
slack

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,199
and something makes you so mad

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,279
but you know you are self-aware this

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,800
thing made me mad

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,519
and you know you want to have a positive

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,759
outcome

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
so you do what you need to do you

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,399
self-regulate

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,480
and then you choose a response that

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
gives you a better outcome maybe you

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
end up having a i'm not sure i

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,880
understand this why don't we

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,720
go to a video call talk it through right

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
that's takes emotional intelligence and

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
these are the key pillars and

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,079
the thing is is that if we can all get

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,199
better at self-awareness

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,120
self-regulation we can really grow our

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,279
emotional intelligence

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
and the nice thing is that you can grow

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,079
emotional intelligence

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,759
much more than you can even your

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,399
cognitive skills

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,800
and the main way in which you

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,040
improve emotional intelligence is

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,120
through mindfulness

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,880
and this is really about being present

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,959
living in the now

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
and it's all about calming your nervous

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,480
system

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,839
so that your emotions don't hijack your

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
brain and take over

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,240
and make you send out that nasty email

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,720
back at someone

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,319
when you're calm you have more access to

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,360
your logic brain

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,360
and you can better assess situations and

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,720
decide how you're going to respond and

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,720
how you're going to influence

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,000
the situation for a better outcome

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,480
and this can really include

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
all kinds of approaches so mindfulness

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,720
could be meditation

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,120
it could be yoga it could be journaling

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
and

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,919
i know google focuses on this a lot

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
uh we have meditation rooms in our

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
buildings back when we used to be able

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,640
to

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
you know use our buildings and we also

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
have a big initiative called search

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
inside yourself which i encourage you to

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,280
check out

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,679
and i know for myself and others i talk

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,320
to

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,960
they think mindfulness sounds pretty

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,919
hokey

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,440
why would i just sit down and do this to

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,520
become a better leader

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,720
beyond the reasons i just gave it's just

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,880
it's a real change

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,600
and i didn't know for myself if i would

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,080
do it but i did start a practice

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,919
and i certainly found that it helped me

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,559
move through burnout

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,559
um i had more efficient

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,799
thought processes so something came up i

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,799
was a little bit more strategic because

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,240
i was just creating more space to think

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,120
instead of react

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:24,160
i prioritize better and overall it just

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,799
helped me move through

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
some hard situations a lot better and so

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,400
i certainly encourage you to look into

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
mindfulness as a way to grow your

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,440
emotional intelligence

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,440
and therefore your leadership skills

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,520
and you know just to help kind of bring

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,280
it home i think tara brock

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,919
she's a buddhist-based psychologist out

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,679
of washington dc here in the u.s

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,080
she explains it fast with this quote and

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,840
it's that between stimulus and response

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,000
there is a space

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
and in that space is the opportunity to

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,080
choose our response

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,000
in our response lies our growth and our

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,000
freedom

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
and so there's that space that we get to

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,039
create and it's

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,520
mindfulness that allows us to step back

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,720
and really create that space where we

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,280
can collect ourselves

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,600
and have a better response it's also

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,080
mindfulness that helps us

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
keep that space ready so that we're not

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,039
struggling all the time we're more

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,720
resilient in the face of

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
any kind of stimulus or conflict that's

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,840
coming at us all day long

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
and it's really important that we're

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,720
resilient and open source

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,919
and that's because of the nature of the

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
way we work

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,760
we work with online communication and

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,960
collaboration

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,160
using github and slack and twitter and

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:48,080
our brains are actually not wired

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,000
for online work we are designed for

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,520
face-to-face interaction reading each

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
other's body cues

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
it really does um trigger the brain in a

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,000
much different way

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
and so when we do this online work

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,720
together it starts to trigger

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,480
what's called a disinhibition effect and

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
there's a couple elements to it

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,919
two that i think are really important to

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,679
call out are

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
when we have online communication we

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
have a lack of eye contact

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,640
and when we have a lack of eye contact

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,120
that reduces empathy for each other

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,400
we're just wired to read body language

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
and emojis

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,679
they don't cut it they just don't help

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,840
the brain process what's going on

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,960
and then the other thing working against

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,159
us is that

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
when we receive online communication we

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,760
almost

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,440
always project a negative voice to it or

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
a more negative voice than what the

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,039
person

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,200
intended and

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,559
it's just really unfortunate but what

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
we're doing is we're working in an

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,880
environment

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,400
where we aren't empathetic and we're

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
kind of assuming the worst from each

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
other

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,960
which is probably why you're hearing all

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,120
the time that you need to assume

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
positive intent like you just have to be

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
self-aware

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,520
of these types of things and assume

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,600
positive intent

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,559
and choose a better response than just

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,679
that

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,280
nasty email back um

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
so we're just being triggered all the

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,440
time in open source

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,600
it does make it hard on many fronts but

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,440
if you have emotional intelligence if

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,520
you are resilient in this way

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,480
you can really do a great job leading

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,679
yourself through all these kinds of new

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,320
interactions you're going to have in

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,320
open source

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,200
so in addition to growing e.i emotional

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,400
intelligence

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,640
with mindfulness you also need some good

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,039
strategies that are just ready to go

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,039
when you encounter some of the

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,280
interesting interactions you'll have in

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,039
open source

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,559
so that way if something does trigger

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,600
you you

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,799
reset and then you respond

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,880
rather than react and there's um

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,159
a couple pro tips for you on how to do

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
this so

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,280
for resetting you can count to ten

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,280
if something's triggered you you can

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,720
take some deep clearing breaths

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,760
comes the nervous system if you're a tea

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,600
drinker you can

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,000
sip hot tea because it takes time to sip

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
tea

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,360
you don't want to burn yourself and

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,159
actually the act of

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,679
taking in the tea is calming to the

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,760
nervous system

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,159
and then last but not least you can

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,400
always just take a walk around the block

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,080
collect your thoughts come back to your

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
computer and decide how you want to

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,200
respond

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,520
and there's a lot of strategies for

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,799
responding

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
one way i like to use is yes and

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,039
it comes from the improv world and

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,039
somebody can say something to you

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,320
and maybe you don't necessarily agree

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,679
but you can say

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,039
yes i hear you and here's another

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,960
approach as well

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,600
and what that does is it builds on ideas

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
rather than saying no and cutting that

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,159
person off

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,000
and then trying to convince them about

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,280
your idea that gets you into more of

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,640
like a battle

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
of ideas another approach is the design

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,080
approach

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,080
i like i wish i wonder so if somebody

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,840
sends you an idea you could say i like

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
this proposal

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,200
i wish it had focused a little bit more

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,240
in this other area

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,280
that's you know interesting to me and i

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,400
wonder if you talk to sally

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,440
if you two might be able to coordinate

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
on filling in that area

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,080
again it's not about cutting off ideas

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,760
it's about designing a conversation and

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,600
a path forward

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,520
some other things that are important are

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,960
non-violent communication skills

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,240
really understanding um some key

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,960
techniques for engaging

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,720
for a positive outcome and it is there's

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,000
books on this and i highly recommend you

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,200
check them out

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,200
um also using active listening skills

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,240
so a lot of times when we're interacting

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,880
we're not

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,000
we're we're so focused on our ideas and

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,919
where we want to go next with the

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,279
conversation we're not always engaged in

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,880
truly listening

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,200
and the person doesn't always know if

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,320
they've been heard so before you take a

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,559
conversation

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
down a whole nother path it's really

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,559
important to use active listening

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,960
asking questions like well um

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,840
what i heard you say was this is that

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
correct

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,960
and then you get aligned on the concepts

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,880
they were trying to share

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,200
and then you can say yes that's great

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,279
and what about this

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,159
and then lastly you know when your

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,200
interactions are going a little south

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
just ask the person to hop on a video

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
call instead

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,440
it's just so much more productive and at

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
least the video helps with the body

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,039
language

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,200
so these are some pro tips that you can

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,919
use um

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,440
for leading yourself through really

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,159
productive interactions in open source

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,720
so phew we got through a lot pretty

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,120
quickly

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
so let me just do a quick recap of

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,640
everything we've covered

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,320
so far you can lead from any position

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,720
and to do so you just need to set a

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,919
vision for yourself and ask for help

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,320
people want to help you and remember

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,960
you can't lead others until you can lead

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,640
yourself so focusing on self-leadership

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,600
is really important and it's going to

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
take

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,679
emotional intelligence to be a good

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,159
leader

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,679
and that's going to require you to start

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,360
a mindfulness practice

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,880
because it's through mindfulness that

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,880
you can grow and strengthen your

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,799
emotional intelligence

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,799
and then finally as you're engaging with

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,000
people being mindful is helpful

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,720
but having strategies for engaging with

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,720
others well is super important so you

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,840
want to practice your strategies to

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,799
reset when something makes you upset and

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,559
that way you know how to respond versus

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,120
react

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,640
and i hope that you will use these

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
different techniques

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,480
because we really do need more leaders

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,279
in open source

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,279
and we are really excited for you to get

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,120
more involved and share your skills and

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,760
talents with all of us

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,559
so i hope that you will start being the

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
leader

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,880
that you need in open source and that we

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,760
all need so thank you so much for your

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,240
time

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,919
and if you have any questions please

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,840
direct them in chat or you can always

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,840
find me on twitter

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
thank you megan that was a really great

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,400
talk uh one of the things i really loved

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
about megan's talk was this thought that

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,159
anybody can lead as long as you learn

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,440
how to act like a leader before you

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,840
actually are one

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
you can become a leader as well and

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,000
that's one of the things i love about

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,400
open source as well like no one told

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
someone

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,279
all the open source leaders that you

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,360
know no one said okay today you are a

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,880
leader like going at it they just uh

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,120
they just started to act like leaders

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,440
and become leaders and embody that

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,200
i also loved that megan spoke about the

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,640
importance of mentors as well

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
mentors were super important to me when

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
i got started in open source stephen how

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,039
about you

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,039
yeah when when i first joined the

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,279
angular team i had a mentor

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,559
named jules kramer who really taught me

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,000
both empathy and this idea that

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,360
contributors to open source

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,720
can really come from everywhere and they

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,200
can take every form of shape

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
i think i found most of my mentors just

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,559
through the open source

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,840
code that i was reading not directly

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,120
interacting with anyone but sort of just

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,799
learning from what people had already

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,039
done and written

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,840
yeah mentors are great and it's it's one

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,679
of the best ways

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,520
to generate more leaders for open source

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,080
we always need more

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,320
leaders in open source we can use as

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,159
many as we can get

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,520
so quick reminder if you have questions

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,600
um feel free to put them

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,039
in the chat at the bottom of the screen

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,360
below us here

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,640
and next we'll have one of our leaders

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,520
here at google aaron

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,840
will talk to us about documentation so

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
take it away

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
aaron

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,799
hey folks thanks so much for having me

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,799
here today

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,559
i'm very much looking forward to talking

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,320
with you all about things that

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,520
you can do in open source documentation

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,240
so i'm erin mckean and i work on docs

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,720
advocacy

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,039
in google's open source programs office

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,440
so my job and it's a very fun one

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,760
is to help open source projects have

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,360
better docs

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,279
if you haven't heard the term docs

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,080
advocacy before well it's still pretty

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,480
new

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,200
basically doc's advocacy is all about

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,600
bringing

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,240
better documentation practices to the

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,520
folks who

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,440
often have the most power to make change

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,399
developers so docs advocacy is

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,320
the developer focus practice of

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,919
encouraging better software docs

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,360
whether that's through making docs

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,559
yourself or helping others make docs

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,840
or by creating a culture that places

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,760
more importance on documentation

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,440
and we all know that docs are important

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,440
but sometimes people are surprised by

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,799
just how important docs

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,480
actually are to developers so in fact 72

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,440
percent of developers who were surveyed

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,520
by tide lift in 2019

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,640
cited established policies and

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,720
documentation

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,120
as a key decision factor that they used

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,960
in choosing open source

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,240
and 93 percent of developers surveyed

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,080
in 2017 by github said that incomplete

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,039
or outdated documentation was a

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,080
pervasive

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,760
problem in open source now i'm focused

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
here on open source because that's what

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
i work on

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,679
but i can't imagine that closed i can't

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,440
imagine that closed source software

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,320
has less of a need for good docs and

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,559
lack of documentation was the top reason

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,600
that developers surveyed by digitalocean

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,320
in 2018

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,760
gave for deciding against using an open

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,000
source project

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,000
so survey after survey shows that

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,080
developers care about docs

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,440
and that they make choices based on

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,840
documentation

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,399
so if your code is awesome but you have

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,519
no dogs or incomplete dogs or outdated

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,840
dogs

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,039
you're actually falling behind less

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,200
technically adept

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,720
or useful projects that have better docs

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,320
so when i tell people that i work on

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,880
making open source stocks better they

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,960
often tell me great we need better docs

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,120
so then i ask okay well what are you

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,080
doing to help your projects have better

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,000
docs

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,919
in open source stocks have to be

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,440
everyone's responsibility

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,279
and so in this talk i want to give you

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,600
five ways that you

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,640
can help make open source documentation

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,080
better

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,679
and yes definitely there's work ahead

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,120
and you might be thinking well i would

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,880
have to be an amazing

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,720
expert to really make a difference in

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,799
open source documentation

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,279
but actually that's not true in fact

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,279
even if you're a complete beginner

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
completely new to open source

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,760
there are lots of ways in which you

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,279
could help make open source

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,519
documentation better

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,640
and in fact in some ways being a

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,039
beginner is an

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,840
asset because it turns out that

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,679
ignorance

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,559
is a constantly shrinking

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,240
resource you will never know less than

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,480
you know today

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,840
now this might sound like i'm joking but

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
one of the problems in writing a

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,519
documentation

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,440
is that once you understand something it

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,840
can be really difficult to put yourself

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
in the mindset of someone who's new to

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,799
it

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,000
beginner's mind is actually a precious

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,640
resource

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,159
so one of the ways in which you can turn

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,159
your current ignorance

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,200
into actual knowledge and something of

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,240
value

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,519
is by creating friction logs

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,960
so friction logging is basically just

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,000
doing stuff while paying attention so

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,600
find a project you'd like to try and

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,760
follow the instructions whether that's

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,480
for a tutorial or a quick start just

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,600
find something that you can do

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,120
and then write everything down write

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,679
down what you tried

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,679
write down what you expected write down

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
what worked and especially write down

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,039
what

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,320
didn't work and what you did to get

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,679
past that little broken step and on to

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,600
the next thing

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,080
i find that even writing down whatever

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,960
search terms i use to try to diagnose

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
the problem

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,159
helps me a lot when i go back to my

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
friction logs to figure out

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,200
how the heck something worked then keep

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,799
going

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
keep going until you've either finished

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,320
the tutorial or the quick start or

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,720
it's so broken that you just can't get

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,279
any farther and then

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,919
share your friction log you can raise an

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,080
issue

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,440
in the project repo and add a link to

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,760
your friction log

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,120
or if you can't find anybody to share it

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,960
with in the project

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,200
a friction log makes a great blog post

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,200
another thing that you can do to help

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,120
open source documentation

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,559
is to go spelunking in the closed issues

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,640
a lot of times there are uh

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,960
closed issues in a project where the

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,879
answer was missing from the docs

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,240
but somebody shared it in the issue to

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,359
help the person who was having the

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,919
problem

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,879
and a lot of the time that help never

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,440
gets put back

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,240
into the docs so looking for closed

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,320
issues especially ones that mention docs

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,079
and finding the information that was

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,639
missing from the docs and then putting

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,440
it where it belongs in the dogs can be a

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,520
huge help by matching the solutions and

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,560
the issues to the gaps in the docs

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,919
you can help a lot of users so how do

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,520
you do this how do you play and match

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,520
the issue to the docs

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,879
first check out a project's closed

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,520
issues

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,159
then look for solutions in the closed

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,879
issues that aren't reflected in the docs

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,919
and write the solutions that are shown

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,159
in the issues

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,520
in a way that they fit into the docs and

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,800
open a pull request

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,720
it's pretty straightforward another

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,359
thing that you can use your

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,240
incredibly valuable rapidly diminishing

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,280
ignorance for

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,480
is replicating bugs again go back to the

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,920
issues of a project

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,839
especially the ones that have been

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
closed because the submitter hasn't

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,000
responded

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,440
and then look for patterns see if you

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,920
can replicate the bug

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,079
and if you can add your steps to the

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,359
issue

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,880
so replicating bugs in issues

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,640
might not actually seem like

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,599
documentation work

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,160
but it's really important a project with

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,200
a lot of

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,599
open issues can be seen by developers as

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,440
having incomplete documentation or being

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,440
not very well maintained

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,079
and by helping to replicate issues

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,079
replicate bugs in issues that are just

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
kind of lying around or stagnant

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,599
you can really help maintainers with

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,800
their burden

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,280
and by replicating issues

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,200
you give other people a step up to

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,320
improve the documentation around those

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,040
issues

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,560
now especially issues where the original

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,640
person isn't responding

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,720
it's probably not because they fixed the

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,160
problem it's probably because they moved

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,320
on to something else

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,200
and for every person who bothers to file

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
an issue

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,040
there are a lot more who just went

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,640
straight onto the find something else

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,640
part

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,000
now once you've worked on friction logs

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,480
for a little while and

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,320
on adding documentation from issues and

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,560
replicating bugs and issues

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,480
the next logical step is to start

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,040
working on tutorials

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,720
not all tutorials have to be fancy some

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,760
of the most useful tutorials are the

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,839
most basic

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,359
and tutorials really help you grow as a

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,960
developer because you can never

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,520
really know something until you've

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,800
explained it to somebody else

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,400
so to write a tutorial i think the first

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,240
place to start is to think about what

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,359
did you get excited about lately

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,280
what were you happy that you learned

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,560
and then think about how would i explain

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,119
this to somebody else

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,960
and if you kept a friction log this is

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,560
great for writing tutorials because you

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,320
could go back and look at every step

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,760
that you did and everything that did and

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,560
didn't work

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,320
now then think about okay well you're

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,359
excited about this thing and you know

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,200
how to do it

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,480
but why would somebody else want to do

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,040
it what makes it cool

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,880
what problem will it solve how will it

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,480
help someone else to know how to do this

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,839
thing

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,240
if you're if you need a little extra

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,560
motivation uh

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,359
find a friend each of you write a

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,440
tutorial

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,800
and then pair up and swap tutorials try

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,960
to work through the other person's

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,119
tutorial and make sure that it works

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,040
also having a friend to do this with

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,440
adds a little bit of accountability just

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,800
in the same way as having a friend

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,560
keep you accountable for exercise does

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,320
even if you never publish a tutorial

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,640
writing one is excellent practice

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,040
as time goes on almost everyone ends up

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,839
spending more time explaining things

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,880
and less time being explained to so

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,079
having good

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,680
clear concise explanation skills

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,240
is really helpful now

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,119
if you can't think of something to do

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,040
copy

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,280
now look around at projects that have

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,960
good docs think about what makes those

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,119
docs good

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
then find a project that you like or

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,359
that you want to use

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,800
that could use some docs love what could

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,560
you copy over

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,119
in terms of types or the structure of

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,119
docs not the actual content obviously

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,480
from the project that has good docs to

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,839
the project that needs a little bit of

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,640
doc's help

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,640
it is 100 okay to look at other projects

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,200
documentation as a model for your own

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,119
docs

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,800
you can just treat them like a coloring

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,560
book the headings

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,720
and the structure are the lines that you

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,720
fill in with your own content crayons

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,240
so when you're trying to copy docs from

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,520
one project to another project first

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,280
pick a project that you like

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,040
you won't be motivated to do docs for a

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,079
project that you don't like

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,240
and then make a list of what kinds of of

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,839
documentation it has or it needs

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,760
does it have a readme but it needs a

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,000
quick start does it have good concept

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,760
documentation but no tutorials

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,599
does it need help with government stocks

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,520
or documentation about participating in

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,400
the community

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,480
look for a list of document templates

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,640
the good docs project and write the docs

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,880
are great resources for this

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,720
or choose a similar project with more

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,839
comprehensive docs that you can use as a

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,280
model

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,359
you can also use doxy.dev which is the

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,440
documentation template for the hugo

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,599
static site generator

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,359
and then use the templates you found to

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,440
help create better docs for the project

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,880
you've chosen

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,560
now i know i said that i was going to

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,920
give you five ways

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,359
that you could help make better open

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,599
source documentation but i'm kind of

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,680
going to give you a bonus round

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,839
so this is from a wonderful series of

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,160
comics by julia evans who goes by the

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,280
name

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,240
bork with zero on twitter i highly

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,320
recommend her work

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,000
it's always entertaining and super

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,400
explanatory

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,640
and so one way that you can add a lot of

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,599
value to documentation and open source

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,520
is by creating a concept stock

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,960
have you ever found a library or a

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,640
project and been like

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,160
i don't even know why i would use this

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,040
what is this even for

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,960
i don't understand what's going on here

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,560
that's a project that could really use a

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,480
concept stock

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,480
now writing a concept stock does take

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,119
more time and more work which is why i

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,680
kind of have it as a bonus round

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,960
but if you want to write a concept stock

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,680
here's how you do it

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,240
find a project where it's unclear why

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,280
you would want to use it what does it do

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,680
make a list of the concepts involved

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,000
write a one sentence explanation of each

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,920
concept now this is a lot easier to say

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,359
than it is to do but give it your best

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,560
shot you just want to have something

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,599
that's short

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,040
and clear now when you're writing one

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,880
sentence explanations

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,160
of some concepts you might find that

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,920
there are other concepts

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,680
involved in those sentences that need

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,880
more explanation

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,119
so go ahead and expand your list keep

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,920
going until you run out of concepts

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,319
and then write a story write a use case

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,760
for the project

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,599
what would someone need to know in order

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,319
to decide whether or not

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,240
to use the project uh and then include

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,359
your explanations in there

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,560
so this is really hard to explain in the

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,720
abstract so i'm going to give you a

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,280
concrete example

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,280
i'm working on a project to demonstrate

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,440
documentation templates

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,000
the project is called chronolog and it

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,920
helps time travelers convert between

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,720
different calendars for more precise

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,720
time travel

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,760
yes this is a joke project it does not

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,640
work

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,240
so a concept doc for chronolog would

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,839
involve explaining

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,560
why would a time traveler want to use

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,680
this what is meant by the

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,920
by the phrase calendrical system what a

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,359
calendrical system conversion program

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,200
does and so forth

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,119
and at the end of that concept doc

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,960
someone would be able to say oh yeah i

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,800
time travel all the time and boy i would

00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,839
really like to be able to like convert

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,599
between the

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,839
mayan and the julian calendar more

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,359
easily or they say oh you know what i

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,200
hardly ever time travel i don't need

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,560
this project

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,480
so i believe that everyone can

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,359
contribute to open source stocks

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,640
if they are sufficiently motivated and

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,680
they have some of these

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,880
uh places to start everyone is a

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,240
beginner at something

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,359
if you've been holding back from

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
contributing to open source

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,079
documentation

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,240
there is no better time to start than

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,599
today

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,520
and now there's one other thing that i

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,560
wanted to mention some of the pushback i

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,000
get from people

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,760
about why they're not contributing to

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,400
open source docs is

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,440
they say oh i'm not a writer now i

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,440
totally understand

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,960
it is scary to work on things and to do

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,880
things that you feel like you might not

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,520
be very good at

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,160
but almost everyone working in software

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,200
development

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,119
has spent more time writing non-code

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,280
that they have spent writing code

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,119
they spent more time talking than they

00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,240
have writing code

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,480
and as long as you can reasonably

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,680
express yourself

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,079
you can help with software documentation

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,079
in my non-google time i run a very large

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,880
online dictionary and api called word

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,800
nic

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,880
and i used to run before i started

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,040
working in tech american dictionaries

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,560
for oxford university press

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,240
and i also run the semicolon

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,040
appreciation society

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,800
so if you want a semi-authority figure

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,560
to tell you not to worry about your

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,240
writing or if you're writing in english

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,960
and it's not your first language i'm

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,560
here to say

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,640
in my professional language person

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,440
opinion you are going to be fine

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,440
use templates look up words when you're

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,000
unsure of their meaning

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,160
ask your trusted friends to give what

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,720
you've written a quick once over

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,000
and most of all accept corrections

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,480
gracefully and

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
with appreciation and most people

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,960
reading your documentation will overlook

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,920
a few misspellings or a typo or two or

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,280
subjects that are

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,040
disagreeing with their verbs

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,400
if you really want to increase the

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,319
impact

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,599
of your work if you really want to

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,400
increase

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,480
your skills as a developer creating

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,560
better documentation is an incredibly

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,160
effective way to do that

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:18,160
i think being able to create good

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,160
documentation is a superpower

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,640
please feel free to ask me questions in

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,119
the live chat i'm

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,599
always happy to answer what i can and to

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,560
try to find links to what i don't know

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,440
and speaking of links i have some links

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,040
for you

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
so first of all there's a really good

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,160
blog post

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,319
on friction logging that i recommend

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,520
that you read it's more from a product

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,920
point of view but it has

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,319
a lot of helpful tips for people who are

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,119
friction logging in open source

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,599
uh again i cannot recommend wizard docs

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,040
by julia evans highly enough the comics

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,720
are great

00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,400
doxie.dev is the documentation focused

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,480
template for the hugo static site

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,280
generator that i mentioned

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,880
it is set up from the perspective of

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,760
someone who's trying to create docs for

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,760
developers

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
the good docs project on github is

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,520
trying to make

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
documentation templates for open source

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,520
it's still very early days as an open

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,720
source project so enthusiastic

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,200
enthusiastic participation is welcome

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,040
and uh if you can't uh think of your

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,319
question right now for the live chat

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,560
you can always reach out to me on

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,160
twitter i'm just ima keen i'm a pink

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,839
robot on twitter so

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,280
if you don't see the pink robot that's

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,200
not me

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,119
and thank you so much for spending time

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,520
with me today to learn about how you can

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,040
help

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,040
in open source documentation

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,640
thank you so much aaron those were some

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,240
really really great tips

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,680
one of my favorite parts was this idea

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,720
that documentation is everyone's

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,400
responsibility

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,599
you don't just have to be a writer to be

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,880
involved in great docs and really the

00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,160
best docs involve everyone's

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,400
participation

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,319
one of the other ideas that aaron talked

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,480
about was this idea of friction logs

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,640
justin do you ever use friction logs

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,240
yeah absolutely um friction logs are

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,400
really core part of

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,920
our internal product advocacy so when

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,800
i'm testing a new feature or a new

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,079
product

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,079
the very first thing i do is write a

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,280
friction log it gives me that beginner

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,480
mindset that she was talking about

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,920
that's so precious and

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,160
helps me categorize everything i've been

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,680
doing uh as i interact with this product

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,240
for the first time so that the product

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,520
teams

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,960
you know know where the friction is they

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,680
know what to fix and what to make

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,040
smoother for next time

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,720
another concept that i think she shared

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,000
was about concept docs

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,440
which is not something i have actually

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,319
used before have you ever used concept

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,240
docs

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,960
no i haven't used it either that was a

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,240
new concept to me as a new concept to me

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,000
as well but uh yeah

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,440
i'm really excited to try it just to

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
sort of evaluate a new project or

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,560
something like that

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,079
awesome well i hope everyone out there

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
is having fun and enjoying google open

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,880
source

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,920
live today if you haven't already put

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
anything in the chat

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,280
definitely go ahead and say hello or say

00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,800
where you're watching from uh

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,079
one silver lining of everyone being

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,960
online is that we can actually reach out

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,400
to kind of

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,680
everyone across the world we can include

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,200
all of our global colleagues which is

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,960
really really nice

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,640
i guess we do that in open source fairly

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,160
often though so but it's always good to

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,440
take an opportunity

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,280
there's a question in the chat about the

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,560
slides um there's going to be all the

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,760
videos are going to be online on the

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,839
youtube channel

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,680
after the event so take a look in the

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,599
chat for the link for that

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,599
up next we have caslin fields and seth

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,040
vargo with a fireside chat

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,559
they are going to be discussing open

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,520
source models and contributor

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:39,839
engagements

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:39,839
over to youtube

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,920
hello and welcome i'm here with seth

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,599
vargo and we're going to have a chat

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,079
about open source

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,839
i'm caslin fields and i'm a developer

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,520
advocate at google i focus on

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,960
kubernetes cloud native devops and all

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,160
sorts of topics in that

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,760
area yeah and i'm seth i'm also a

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,760
developer advocate at google

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,880
primarily focused on security but

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,440
recently i've been

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,400
working on exposure notifications which

00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,559
is a

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,040
tool to help stop the spread of covet

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,680
that is a super interesting topic and

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,119
then

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,800
i think we'll talk a little bit about

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,680
that in a bit

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,200
but first off i want to start with we're

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,960
talking about open source today

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,240
what kinds of open source projects are

00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,880
you involved with and how did you get

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,599
started working with open source

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,359
yeah so like i was just saying today

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,200
honestly most of my day is spent working

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,160
on exposure notifications on the server

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,880
component

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,800
um so this is a joint effort between

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,040
google apple and microsoft

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,559
to help stop the spread of covid we have

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,680
a server the server is

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,800
open source it's at github.com google

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,160
exposure notification server um and it's

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,559
written in go which is also an open

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,720
source

00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,240
uh project uh programming language so

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,960
there's kind of a double dipping there a

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,040
little bit

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,400
um you know prior to that i've worked on

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,920
a number of open source projects at

00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,160
google including like gcr

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,720
cleaner and burr glass um and then

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,079
before that uh bg before google

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,640
i worked at hashicorp for a number of

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,800
years which is a company largely based

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,359
on open source software tools like baker

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,280
packer surf console nomad vault

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,720
did a lot of work in the the vagrant and

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,880
fault ecosystems

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,319
um and you know before that i worked at

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,440
chef software which is also a company

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,559
based on open source

00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,119
primarily doing a lot of ruby

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,119
development and ecosystem development

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,559
but my first open source project ever

00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,680
was actually when i was an undergrad at

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,480
carnegie mellon

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,200
um i wrote a small little rubygem that

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,079
could

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,200
query the isbn db database so that you

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,599
could look up a text

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,040
textbook by its barcode number for a

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,760
little startup that we were working on

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,359
that

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,440
ultimately failed but you know you live

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,720
and you learn

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,720
what about you and how did you get

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,640
involved yeah so

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,480
i mentioned that i do kubernetes things

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,880
i'm involved in the special interest

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,880
group

00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,599
within the kubernetes project that's

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,920
focused on contributor experience

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,880
specifically a team that focuses on kind

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,359
of

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,960
internal upstream marketing so i take

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,319
the things that

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,400
contributors are doing within the

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,720
kubernetes project and i help other

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,640
contributors see what they're doing

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,079
that can help inspire people to find a

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,760
new project to work on that they're

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,559
really interested in

00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,079
it's a great way to learn about all of

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,640
the different types of projects that are

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,319
going on within kubernetes it's

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,480
a broad spectrum of areas and types of

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,960
projects so i'm really excited to get to

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,920
see all these sorts of like broad

00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,200
categories

00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,440
of things that people are doing within

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,480
kubernetes and i'm also a cncf

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,480
ambassador

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,760
so that's the cloud native computing

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,599
foundation and

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,359
with them i do a lot of things to kind

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,559
of help promote their

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:35,839
community help kind of organize

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,760
things i volunteer at conferences and

00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:40,160
help with webinars and things like that

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,520
so i'm i do a lot of things that are

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:47,040
related to open source community

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,880
cool awesome which kind of brings up

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,119
an interesting point that we might want

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,680
to talk about is

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,800
open source communities and how does

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,200
open source work

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,079
i think in the current situation of the

00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,760
world

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,839
there's a lot of interesting things that

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,880
we can learn from the way that open

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,520
source does their work

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,400
yeah for sure i think um you know with

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,640
the the current situation with covid

00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,400
traditional nine to five and commuting

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,520
to and from an office every day is

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,079
is pretty much non-existent um and for

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,920
that reason

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,240
many people have reinvented the way that

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,839
they work um whether that's because you

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,559
have you know family or loved ones at

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,359
home or

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,040
new pets and new furry friends um you

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,440
know you may be working

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,040
at really odd hours two hours here two

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,640
hours there instead of this you know

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,079
normal chunk of time

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,520
and because of that i think we're

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,319
starting to see open source software

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,640
flourish

00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:42,160
because open source is designed and

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,000
these communities operate in a way

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,000
that's highly asynchronous

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,599
um you know even if you look at a lot of

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,800
the source code platforms we have like

00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,480
github and gitlab

00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,640
they're all designed around asynchronous

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,319
communication comment threading

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,680
multiple approvers so that there's no

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,280
single points of failure

00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,280
and that's really enabling open source

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,440
to flourish in this environment

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,280
as opposed to maybe a traditional like

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,040
waterfall software method that requires

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,400
you know very rigorous points in time

00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,720
and checkpoints for things to

00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,559
move throughout a system um and i also

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,800
think that this situation is giving

00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,359
people an opportunity to explore

00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,280
contributing to open source more because

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,960
they might be branching outside of their

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,319
you know regular day-to-day work

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,240
some people are finding that they're

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,839
more productive actually by working from

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,200
home or working

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,880
outside of the office with less

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,640
distractions

00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,400
and that's giving them additional time

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,680
to you know explore open source projects

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,880
and open source communities and

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,800
ways that they might get involved yeah

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,160
an important thing that i want to point

00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,040
out there that i am

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,319
involved a lot with in my role with

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,720
kubernetes

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,480
is that these projects are often global

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,440
especially kubernetes such a large

00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,520
project

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,880
they have the opportunity for people all

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,079
over the world to contribute to

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,000
kubernetes

00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,200
and that can pose all sorts of different

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,520
challenges that

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,520
a lot of folks might be dealing with

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,319
today as well in their work

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,880
uh having to since everyone is staying

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,319
home

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,160
you might have to collaborate with

00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,359
people in different time zones and then

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,000
all sorts of different places in the

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,599
world

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
and a lot of open source communities are

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,920
just used to that they do it all the

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,000
time

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,000
and they're they're familiar with all

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,720
the challenges that poses

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,160
and they have come up with their various

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,440
solutions a lot of

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,480
the time there's a meeting in my morning

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,520
and my evening

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,559
that hits different time zones and

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,240
all sorts of programs and

00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,839
kind of leaders situated in different

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,559
parts of the world that all work

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,760
together

00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:40,160
which is really cool to see yeah i think

00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,400
like open source has been

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,599
remote largely from the beginning

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,960
because of the way that

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,400
you know contributors come from

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,920
different backgrounds and time zones and

00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,319
countries and languages

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,599
that um you know not only has there not

00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,599
really been an interruption

00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,200
to the velocity at which open source

00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,720
software is being developed

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,559
but i think it's quite the opposite i

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,720
think we've seen an acceleration as more

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,400
and more people get involved

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,839
yeah which brings up another really

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,839
interesting point is

00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:08,720
who contributes to open source who are

00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:10,480
all of these people all across the world

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,000
so honestly anyone can contribute to

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,359
open source um

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,200
oftentimes we talk about open source

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,200
software and we talk about the s word

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,480
the software and that that tends to lead

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,480
like to developer or

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,839
software engineer and um that's

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,200
something i really want to dispel is

00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,319
like you don't have to be a software

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
engineer and you don't have to be

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,960
writing code

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,240
in order to contribute to open source

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,880
you don't have to be a software engineer

00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,400
to write code

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,040
and you don't have to be writing code to

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,720
contribute to open source um

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,480
i can't think of a single open source

00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,760
project that wouldn't gladly accept a

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,640
documentation

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,839
uh a fix or uh especially you're talking

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,720
about global climate earlier or

00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,559
translation

00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,720
of documentation into another language

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,920
so that you know you have localization

00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,000
all of these things are incredibly

00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,720
welcome in open source projects and

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,760
don't require you to write code uh or

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,400
you know be an action

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,319
an engineer um there's also a ton of

00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,680
other things that build an open source

00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,960
community

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,520
things like logos and graphics and swag

00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,640
and

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,440
you know pre-covered meetups and local

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,920
you know local

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,839
human human interaction um i think like

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,160
a really good example of this is like go

00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,440
go the programming language is also an

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,000
open source project an open source

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,400
community

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,319
they have this this cute little um kind

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,720
of mascot is it's a gopher

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,000
and there have been folks from you know

00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,000
the community who have

00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,680
taken that and turned it into you know

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,040
amazing cute little artwork

00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,799
that you know people have stickers on

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,000
their laptops and backgrounds on their

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,920
computers and

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,160
um that dramatically improved the

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,920
continuity of community

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,359
um but didn't involve you know to the

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,000
best of my knowledge writing any

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,440
uh you know go code um and these are you

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,359
know just a few of the ways that

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,799
you can get involved in open source

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,160
obviously you can write code nothing's

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,839
stopping you from doing that

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,200
but i really dislike whenever i hear

00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,640
people say like oh i'm just a tech

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,359
writer i can't really contribute to open

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,960
source

00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,640
that's really not the case i would argue

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,880
that your contributions might even be

00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,640
more important than code contributions

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,920
especially you know for a more mature

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,280
project because

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,280
ultimately you're starting to get people

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,880
who aren't directly familiar with the

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,520
technology and they really need that

00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,200
documentation in order to be successful

00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,040
and also with the current situation of

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,280
the world there are so many people at

00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,920
home right now who are trying to learn

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,400
new languages learn all sorts of

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,000
different

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,319
technologies and tools and a lot of

00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
the information they're getting comes

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:29,359
from the documentation

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,440
it's a primary source of of

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:35,040
knowledge on any open source project so

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,280
those contributions get a lot of

00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,960
a lot of views they're very visible

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,160
contributions and they're very highly

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,839
valued

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,599
so that's a really important way that

00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:45,119
people can contribute even if they're

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,359
not as comfortable doing

00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,880
code and maybe if they want to learn how

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,119
to code or they want to start

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,520
contributing to a project

00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,200
in those kinds of ways documentation is

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,440
also a great place to start because you

00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,160
can learn so much about what the project

00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,720
does and how it works and the use cases

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,359
of it

00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,240
and that can be great for informing your

00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,760
efforts

00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,200
as you start to contribute to the

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,040
project in code as well if you're

00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,319
interested in that

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,920
yeah and if you are just going to jump

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,280
straight into code you know another

00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,280
thing that's really important is you

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,280
know read the contributing guidelines

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,720
and you know do take some time to

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,079
understand the goals of the project

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,079
right if you're contributing an open

00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,079
source project that

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,200
you know is designed to open and close a

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,440
garage door

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,640
and you know you contribute

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,760
functionality

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:34,720
that makes it also cook you an omelet

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,200
um that's probably what we call scope

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
creep

00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,319
and you know you really want to stay

00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,720
true to the

00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,760
uh the core principles of the project uh

00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,119
that may include

00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,440
things like a code of conduct and the

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,200
contributing guidelines it may include

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,280
things more on the legal side like

00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,799
signing a contributor license agreement

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,559
but you also just want to make sure that

00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,160
your change or your contribution or

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,599
suggestion is in line with the goals of

00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,359
the project

00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,200
and some projects intentionally limit

00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,240
their scope to be very very small

00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,000
either because they don't have the

00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,520
resources and staffing to support a

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,119
broader scope

00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,559
or because they really you know follow

00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,119
the unix philosophy and just like want

00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,280
to do one thing and do it really well

00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,760
yeah and that's an important point to

00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,960
mention too is that

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,520
open source has been doing this this

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,319
kind of

00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,160
virtual uh distributed thing for a long

00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,880
time so there's a lot that businesses

00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,640
and

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,960
groups can learn about how to

00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,680
collaborate from the processes that

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,440
these

00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,359
open source communities have in place

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,720
already

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,920
yeah for sure yeah and so i'd like to

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,880
talk a little bit more about what you're

00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,640
doing with your

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,960
project right now to address covet 19.

00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:46,880
can you tell us more about that

00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,760
yeah so um oh boy there's so much

00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,640
uh so there's uh two main components

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,960
that i'm

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,640
involved in in the day-to-day we have uh

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,079
two server components both of them are

00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,079
open source on github

00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,480
um the first is the actual exposure

00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,040
notification server um

01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,079
this is the server that your android or

01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,480
ios device

01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,520
actually publishes temporary exposure

01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,280
keys to

01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,960
um and then we have a verification

01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,799
server also open source

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,319
that is typically run by like a public

01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,720
health authority um

01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,160
which verifies that when your device is

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,240
uploading these keys

01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,599
that you were actually seen by a medical

01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,319
professional or

01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,520
a clinic or if you did a self-diagnosis

01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,839
you know with a test at home

01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,599
that there's metadata attached to that

01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,559
but the entire system is open source for

01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,240
two reasons

01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:36,079
um first is we wanted people

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,880
and particularly security reachers

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,640
researchers to be able to look and find

01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,000
any vulnerabilities we have in the code

01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,280
we wanted people to be able to see

01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
that we're working in the open and then

01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,680
we're not hiding anything and the second

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,520
is that we're really focused on building

01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,280
a privacy preserving system

01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,880
and this is where again open source

01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,400
being open and anyone can go look at the

01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,799
code is very important

01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,400
um if you're concerned about privacy uh

01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,920
you can actually go audit the code the

01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,520
code that is running on device and the

01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,880
code that is running in the server

01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,559
and you can see that we're following

01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,799
privacy preserving principles

01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,079
um and this is really important and one

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:10,240
of the ways that i don't think we

01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,920
talk about very much in open source is

01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,319
you know the code is available you can

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,720
look at it there's lots of security

01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,680
kind of talks around it but there's also

01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,280
the privacy bit

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,440
as well is you know you can look at this

01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,799
code and you can see is it phoning home

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,200
is it publishing metrics is it um

01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:28,960
you know logging my ip address somewhere

01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,319
and all of that's you know available and

01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,440
visible out in the open

01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,680
with the work that we're doing on the

01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,960
exposure notification server um

01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,880
and then we have a very similar thing on

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,559
the client side um there's a sample

01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,280
reference architecture and application

01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,839
available

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,040
on the android side um but i'm not

01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,720
directly involved in that so i can't

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,839
speak too much about

01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,319
what that looks like that is such an

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,640
interesting space and i think it's so

01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:55,359
interesting that you talk about

01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,319
privacy and open source and the

01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,559
opportunity for

01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:59,599
people who are using the software to

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,680
actually go and see

01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,960
what the privacy implications of using

01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,720
it are

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,720
and i think that poses an interesting

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,319
question about businesses using open

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,720
source too

01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:12,079
businesses have all sorts of privacy and

01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,799
governance concerns

01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,480
that they have to deal with so it can be

01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,440
surprising sometimes to people to hear

01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,440
that a lot of

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,960
businesses these days are using open

01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,880
source software and

01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,359
also sometimes paying people to

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,839
contribute to open source software

01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:30,880
so can you talk more about how that

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,680
works and why businesses do that

01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,720
yeah so i think businesses have learned

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,160
uh

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,079
for better or worse that there's a

01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,760
growing need um

01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,839
and a growing trend where these

01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,960
businesses just refuse to operate closed

01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:46,400
source software

01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,880
um and this is interesting because uh

01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,160
in the past you know an organization

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,920
would just buy an off-the-shelf

01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,520
you know software appliance they would

01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,799
run it and give it an ip address and

01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,559
like boom it works

01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,760
um but then what they would find is it

01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,319
was very difficult to upgrade that

01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,680
software

01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,280
it was very opaque they had no

01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,079
visibility into how it worked they

01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,520
couldn't extend

01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,280
it they couldn't go integrate it with

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,359
the hr system or the

01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,799
social media system because there was no

01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,039
visibility into the system it was

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,880
entirely opaque no transparency

01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,400
and worst case scenario if the company

01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,160
that provided that software

01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,000
uh no longer existed they couldn't get

01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,200
the support that they needed

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,280
and oftentimes these were you know

01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,000
critical core business functionality

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,799
so oftentimes businesses are looking to

01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,640
open source

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,400
because it provides a safety net they

01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,760
know that if the the company or the

01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,280
community that's supporting the software

01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,200
under the hood were to go away

01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,799
they have the ability to you know

01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,400
ingress that code internally

01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,000
and build a team around it to continue

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,680
cultivating it and working and making it

01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,359
work for their business and maintaining

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,799
continuity of business

01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,559
this creates incentives for businesses

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,160
to also contribute back to these

01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,640
projects so

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,680
um i guarantee you and hopefully tim

01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,359
hawkins doesn't yell at me that

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,319
kubernetes did not work for everyone

01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:55,520
when we released

01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,960
you know 0.5 0.7 to the world um and a

01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,839
lot of the contributions that we've

01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,920
gotten

01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:02,160
for critical functionality actually came

01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,400
from proposals and contributions from

01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,599
non-core contributors people at other

01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,480
companies that were trying to use

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,839
kubernetes

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,599
at scale in production and they were

01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,640
hitting either bugs or missing

01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,440
functionality

01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,880
so um because these businesses want open

01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,240
source software and they want to be able

01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,920
to contribute and extend

01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,240
they're also incentivized to contribute

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,920
directly and then everyone benefits from

01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,839
those contributions and they make these

01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,400
contributions using their engineering

01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,079
talent

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,680
either part-time or full-time to

01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,160
contribute to these open source projects

01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,319
and

01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,920
even at google um you know we have the

01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,440
ability to go contribute to open source

01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,640
projects we can request

01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,799
approval through our open source

01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,880
programs office and we have 10 and 20

01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,240
projects but we also have googlers who

01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,400
are employed full-time

01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,839
to work on open source projects

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,319
kubernetes and go are

01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:48,000
are two really good examples also istio

01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,760
where we have googlers who it's their

01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,920
full-time job to go work in open source

01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,440
software

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,119
yeah that's a really important thing

01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,720
that a lot of people

01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,880
who are just getting started learning

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,599
about open source might not know about

01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,119
is that there are people who start doing

01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,200
open source in their free time

01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,640
outside of their work it could be

01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,359
completely unrelated to their normal

01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,760
work

01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:11,839
but then there are also people who do

01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,799
open source as their jobs

01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:17,839
or as part of their jobs so could you

01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,839
talk a little more about that

01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:25,280
yeah so there's um

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,920
there's people who you know are employed

01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,319
full time

01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,640
to do open source and they're typically

01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,599
employed by a person or a foundation

01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,280
who uh supports that work there is a new

01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,280
funding model that's starting to emerge

01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,200
where people are self-funded um github

01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,720
has a program called github sponsors

01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,559
um there's you know services like

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,599
patreon and even just venmo

01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,599
where you can ask people to donate

01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,960
uh or make contributions to pay your

01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,319
salary so that you can work on open

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,000
source as an independent

01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,680
um there was actually an article a few

01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,960
weeks ago about someone who's making

01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,880
over a hundred thousand dollars a year

01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,920
using github sponsors as an independent

01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,359
developer so

01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,720
you can actually make this profitable um

01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,160
some people are working for a company

01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,440
and the company pays them this is part

01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,119
of their salary and some people are

01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,559
doing it on a volunteer basis you know

01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,319
especially in light of covet

01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,640
people are working odd hours like i said

01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:14,640
earlier the nine to five is kind of dead

01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,240
um so maybe you're contributing to an

01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,200
open source project in the evenings or

01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,640
on the weekends

01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,079
maybe you're learning a new language and

01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,440
you found a project that's using it and

01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,960
that's a great way to marry those

01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,520
those two uh things that you're

01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,960
exploring um

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,799
and and you know when you're doing that

01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,319
i think another reason that people

01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:32,000
contribute to open source is it's more

01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,000
than code right there's a community

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,280
around it whether that's you know slack

01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,319
or discord or

01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,200
disqus or uh you know getter and all

01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,880
these various

01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,480
chat forums ultimately open source

01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,200
communities are community in their

01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,559
network and you know some people are

01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,319
feeling a little bit uncertain

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,839
in their job security we've seen a lot

01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,599
of layoffs and a lot of people are

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,520
getting involved in open source because

01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,839
speaking from personal experience you

01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,680
can actually get a job working in open

01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,000
source you can network with companies

01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,920
and

01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,200
people at companies who can give you

01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,799
referrals um

01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,559
and if you're a hiring manager at a

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,839
company that has head count and is

01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,119
actively hiring

01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,480
going and looking at open source

01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,000
projects and finding people who are

01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,359
doing the work that you want them

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,680
that you think is valuable to your

01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,960
company is a great way to you know build

01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,480
a list of potential candidates and get

01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,079
them into an interview loop

01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,520
um so i think we're also seeing a little

01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,079
bit of an explosion with open source

01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,520
there

01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,960
uh because it does give people a bit of

01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,280
a resume and it gives people some

01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,440
visibility and allows them to network

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,280
um and you learn a whole lot more about

01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,039
how people work with one another and

01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,880
you know their technical ability whether

01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,079
that's coding or writing or

01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,440
communication um through these projects

01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,520
you know far more than you could ever

01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,440
get in a you know a 30 minute or a

01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,200
one-hour long interview

01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,480
yeah it's an amazing way to build your

01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,160
resume and kind of show

01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,839
the kinds of work that you can do and

01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,160
that you're interested in

01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:52,480
so it's been a really valuable resource

01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:55,839
for a lot of folks

01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,920
any last words that you want to share

01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:59,599
i guess um i mean besides kubernetes

01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,799
what's a kind of like up and coming open

01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,079
source project that you're really

01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:05,680
excited about caslin

01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,559
oh wow what am i interested in with open

01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,920
source right now

01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,599
you know i've been looking a lot at

01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,319
service meshes lately

01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,440
the various technologies involved with

01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,400
service meshes

01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,759
envoy linker d istio all of those types

01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,239
of things are really interesting to me

01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,199
so i'm

01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:22,480
excited to get into those more that's

01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,400
something that i really want to get

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,679
involved with

01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,560
awesome yeah and you

01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,799
um so i've been following uh there's a

01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,239
new technology uh called cadence from a

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,279
company called temporal that was spun

01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,359
out of uber

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,440
um they're doing this workflows as code

01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,960
thing that i think is really interesting

01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,759
i think it's really ahead of the curve

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,799
and they have some really cool

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,960
technology

01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,159
but the the cool part to me is like the

01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,880
community that they've been able to

01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:48,799
build

01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,880
um you know they have a very vibrant

01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,000
slack channel very active github and

01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,199
very active discord

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,640
community um for a you know relatively

01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:58,480
niche tool right now

01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,080
um and it's really good to see like

01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,279
their founders are directly interacting

01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,319
with the community and

01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,799
i think they're just doing a really good

01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,040
job of building a healthy um

01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:09,600
like open source community and also a

01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,440
business on top of that

01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,799
yeah there's so many different types of

01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,400
open source projects out there

01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,560
i think there's something for just about

01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:20,080
anyone to get excited about

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,600
yeah yeah so i hope everyone learned

01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,719
something i hope that you're excited

01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,319
about open source

01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:35,839
and now i'm going to pass it back over

01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:35,839
to rncs

01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,279
thank you so much caslin and seth it's

01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,080
crazy to think about how many different

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,920
ways there are

01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,359
to get involved and contribute to open

01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,359
source software

01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,040
and i love the idea that open source and

01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,319
work from home actually go together so

01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,239
well in terms of

01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,000
kind of aligning the opportunity with

01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:56,239
the possibility and the demand so

01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,199
that's such a cool idea and one of the

01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,080
things that you talked about was this

01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,520
idea of new

01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,520
and open source projects that we're all

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,880
excited about and so dustin

01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,000
are there any new or open source

01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,960
projects that you're excited about right

01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,719
now

01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,400
actually yeah um i've been kind of

01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,880
keeping an eye on this project

01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,719
edgeddb which is a new database um i

01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,080
guess it's kind of a blend of nosql and

01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,840
relational databases i

01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,199
don't know a lot about databases but it

01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,400
seems kind of interesting to me how

01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,159
about you

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,760
yeah i i love whenever we can come up

01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,080
with kind of better ways of storing a

01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,840
new

01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,960
better patterns for developer experience

01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,400
there there's two projects that i'm

01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,960
looking at right now one is called nest

01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,679
js

01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,360
and the other one is called scully and

01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,199
they're in the web space trying to make

01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,360
developers lives easier to achieve the

01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:37,280
search results they're looking for

01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,880
as always as we continue here to our

01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,480
last session please put your questions

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,920
in the chat as you think of them

01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,600
and start getting pumped for the after

01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,120
party where we're going to be live and

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,640
engaging with everyone

01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,560
we've got one segment left to go before

01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,360
the after parties and we're coming full

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,040
circle here

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,560
megan is going to be back to talk to us

01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,360
a little bit about sustainability in

01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:59,840
open source

01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:59,840
over to you megan

01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,040
hi i'm megan byrd sanechi and i'm a

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,000
manager at google's open source programs

01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,159
office

01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,040
and i am so glad that you are joining me

01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,199
today

01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,800
for this important topic open source

01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:11,040
sustainability

01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,480
and i want to thank you for making time

01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:15,679
because

01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,440
we all use open source so heavily now

01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,920
it's really important

01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:22,560
that we make sure it's future-proofed

01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,280
and sustainable moving forward

01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,840
and we can only do that together so

01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,800
today

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,560
i'm going to talk about what is open

01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,800
source sustainability

01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,159
and how do we combat sustainability

01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,280
issues

01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:39,520
and we're also going to talk about how

01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,360
google is contributing and how you can

01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,280
as well

01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,600
so the first thing to point out is that

01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:49,120
open source has clearly won

01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:52,159
you can see from this survey that 95

01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,480
of a thousand it decision makers said

01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,760
that

01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,159
open source is not only used in their

01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,080
organization but it's strategic to their

01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:03,120
organization

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:06,400
so we are all relying on open source

01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:09,040
in so many ways and as i've mentioned

01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:12,880
before it's just really important that

01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,000
it is a viable option for us into the

01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,440
future

01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,120
and that means we need to make it

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,719
sustainable

01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:23,280
but what does sustainability really mean

01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,320
you know in short it's about projects

01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,239
being resilient

01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,400
in the face of change and this is well

01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:31,679
defined by a group called sustain

01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:35,440
oss which i really believe is a great

01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:37,600
definition for sustainability

01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,920
you see open source is so much more than

01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,800
code that's just the end result

01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,440
it requires certain ingredients to come

01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,159
together

01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,840
to make that code and i like to use the

01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:51,280
simple framework of

01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,199
people process and technology and what i

01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,400
mean by that is that

01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:58,239
we need people to build the project

01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,400
and we need them to have all kinds of

01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,360
talents and skills and backgrounds to do

01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,760
that

01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,640
and we need them to work together and

01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,440
work together

01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,239
well with clear healthy processes so

01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,640
they're really

01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:12,239
efficient and effective as they're

01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,040
collaborating

01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,960
and then the last area is that they need

01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:19,520
a whole set of tools

01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,880
to facilitate their work whether that's

01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,080
contributor tools

01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:26,640
or communication tools

01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,679
and you need these three areas set up

01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,560
for success

01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,360
and to all be resilient and when you

01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,199
don't

01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,280
have that then what happens is you start

01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:37,920
to see cracks in the project

01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,000
and unfortunately the project starts to

01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,280
fall down on its ability to deliver

01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,560
great code

01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,120
and it can eventually just die on the

01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,800
vine

01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:52,159
as they say and so you really do

01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,679
need these ingredients to be healthy

01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:56,560
so that they are resilient in the face

01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,040
of change and that change can come the

01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,080
form

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:03,440
of many forces the first one

01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,960
that's commonly known in the industry is

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,679
tragedy of commons

01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,320
and that's simply when you have people

01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,560
that have

01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,600
started to contribute and then a lot of

01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,920
people who are

01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,679
downloading and using the software and

01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,880
those original contributors might be

01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,679
getting tired

01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,920
and those new users are not coming back

01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,600
to contribute as well

01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,360
and eventually you just have an

01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,640
imbalance and

01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:31,120
uh you don't have enough new talent

01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,719
to leave those that are ready to move on

01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:35,199
and there's just all kinds of stress

01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,640
fractures associated with that

01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:39,840
the other force that creates change and

01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,120
impact in a project

01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,719
is how a project goes through different

01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,840
stages

01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,440
through life cycle stages so it starts

01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,120
small and might just be a few people

01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,159
working on it and then it gets bigger

01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,560
and bigger and

01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:56,400
it starts to need governance to tell

01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,719
people how to work well together

01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,080
it needs more process it needs different

01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,080
kinds of talent

01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,840
and if it doesn't have the right

01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,520
ingredients at each stage

01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,520
it's just not going to progress to the

01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,880
next stage it might even go

01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,760
backwards so that's another area that

01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,320
is pretty common with projects another

01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,800
force

01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,480
that impacts projects is changes in the

01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,640
competitive landscape

01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,000
so you might have a project that solves

01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,159
a certain problem

01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,640
and then another project comes out that

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:29,280
solves that problem in a different way

01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,360
you know eventually if that other

01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,679
project is more popular or solves the

01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,679
problem better you're going to lose

01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:38,159
contributors to this other project

01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,719
you're going to lose end users to that

01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,400
project

01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,800
and you're going to see just the overall

01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:46,320
decline in engagement

01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,360
and so that's an unfortunate outcome

01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,120
that can happen

01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,800
when you see shifts in the competitive

01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:54,480
landscape

01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,120
another common area that creates a lot

01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,159
of change

01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:00,239
disruptive change are global trends and

01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:02,880
the most common one the most recent one

01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:06,080
right now is covet

01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,159
covet started and projects that were

01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,080
relying on in-person events and the

01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:12,239
funding from those events found that

01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,080
they had to cancel the events and they

01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,760
were scrambling to find money to keep

01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,880
their foundations afloat to pay for

01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,840
servers

01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,080
they were also finding it really hard to

01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,960
suddenly move into a fully online

01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,199
community

01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:28,400
how do you run meetups online where do

01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:30,880
you get the tools and the best practices

01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,960
and so there's lots of headwinds like

01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,159
this and others that i haven't mentioned

01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:39,360
but it is true

01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:40,960
that projects have to deal with a lot

01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,480
whether they realize it or not

01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,480
as they're getting started and moving

01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,920
through their journey it's also

01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:49,440
important to note that

01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,400
no projects sustainability needs are the

01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,800
same

01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,800
everyone is in different places and

01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,440
unfortunately there isn't

01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,000
a tool out there to just tell the

01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,480
community

01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,280
oh you're having resilience issues um

01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,560
and

01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,080
this is where you're starting to see

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,040
cracks in the system and this is what

01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,280
you need to do

01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,080
that doesn't exist you have to rely on

01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,840
people

01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,159
being very engaged in your project and

01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,560
actively

01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,199
identifying these and there's no

01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,560
training

01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:18,320
it's not something that people normally

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,520
do and so

01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,400
um there's just a real gap here in what

01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,159
can happen

01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:28,719
and what you can do proactively to

01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,360
get ahead of some of these stress

01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,880
fractures

01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:36,159
in your project so how do we make

01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,679
projects sustainable what happens

01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:42,560
when you don't have sustainable

01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,840
projects well you end up having lots of

01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,120
challenges and pain

01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,840
and i broke them out into a couple

01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,560
categories the first one's around people

01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,679
uh you have pain with maintainers and

01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,520
contributors

01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,840
so you can have burnout when there's

01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,800
just not enough help coming

01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,480
um prs can languish and there might be

01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,199
great ideas in some of those pull

01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,600
requests

01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:06,000
that just never get to see the light of

01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,880
day because there's just no one there to

01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,280
take it to the next level you might see

01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,640
other

01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,960
issues like a toxic community

01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,760
because there just hasn't been time to

01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,280
really create a

01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,640
welcoming space with good values

01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,520
and good ways of interacting with each

01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,000
other

01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,560
good governance to ensure that happens a

01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,679
code of conduct things like that

01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,960
um you can also have challenges with end

01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,320
users

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,120
they eventually might just lose trust of

01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,320
your project

01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,600
maybe they have security concerns or

01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,440
they start seeing there's lower

01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,640
engagement with your community and

01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,040
they're like yeah

01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,120
i don't know if i want to invest in a

01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:51,600
project that has declining

01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,679
community members and engagement because

01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,000
that is a metric that they look at

01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:57,520
um it also might be that there isn't

01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,320
enough talent in a project

01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,040
might just be totally indexed for uh

01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,480
code

01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:06,639
coders but not enough tech writers and

01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,520
suddenly a project finds itself with

01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,480
poor or

01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,880
lacking documentation and end users need

01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,120
that

01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,560
documentation in order to figure out how

01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:20,400
to use and adopt the software

01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:22,239
another area is code infrastructure so

01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,159
when a project isn't resilient and they

01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,520
don't have let's say enough funding they

01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,120
may not be able to get the

01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,840
infrastructure they need to support the

01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:32,239
project

01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:34,000
they may not be able to pay for servers

01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,520
or the tests that they need and it could

01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,600
impact their release

01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:42,560
cadence another area where you

01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,440
might see challenges is the foundations

01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,840
that

01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,040
support the community and a lot of it

01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,960
has to do with

01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,239
funding challenges if they just don't

01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,280
have enough funding

01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:56,320
they can't serve their mission to

01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,199
support the community or help accelerate

01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,320
innovation

01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:01,440
within the community and perhaps they

01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:05,040
aren't able to

01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,239
fund the legal and financial support

01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,600
that they need to be

01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:12,400
a healthy organization um and so

01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,800
these are just all kinds of different

01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:18,560
challenges that you might see

01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,560
when a project isn't resilient

01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,360
and so what do you do when projects have

01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,760
these kinds of challenges

01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,480
and none of no project is the same in

01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:34,080
terms of their needs

01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:37,280
well one answer that

01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:40,400
um we have found is that

01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:43,120
diversity is a great anecdote for

01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:46,000
building resilience in a project

01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,440
and it's diversity on a couple different

01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,080
axes

01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,520
diverse community members and diverse

01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,400
contributions

01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,880
you see some people think that um

01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,719
there's

01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,440
kind of a silver bullet oh we just need

01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,520
to get end users to contribute back and

01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,600
that will solve the problem

01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,120
others might say well we just need to

01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,440
invest in better security

01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,560
and that will make projects more

01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,679
sustainable

01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,000
and these are all correct answers but

01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:16,320
they're all very tactical answers and

01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,880
you realize there's a bunch of them

01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,639
when you pull the lens back you realize

01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:23,520
it's really about

01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:26,239
diversity that builds resilience and let

01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:29,040
me tell you what i mean

01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:30,639
so when you look at diversity in terms

01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:34,880
of community members

01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:37,679
we are very much talking about um

01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,000
diversity in terms of including those

01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,920
from

01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:45,120
the various underrepresented groups

01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:47,760
because different perspectives

01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,600
make great solutions and so you want

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,960
diverse talent

01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,040
and that's going to require different

01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,000
ingredients to be in place you need a

01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,600
welcoming

01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,159
safe community that has values in place

01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,719
and governance and culture that supports

01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:04,639
diversity and you need to be very

01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,960
intentional with your outreach

01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:08,560
not just asking your friend to join but

01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,840
really reaching out

01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,520
to recruit community members so that you

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,719
truly have a diverse

01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,560
member base and there's so much more

01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,880
that you can do on this front that i

01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,760
won't have time to get into but i highly

01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,360
recommend

01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,920
you go to all the many resources that

01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,920
are out there

01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,719
the other axis on diversity is different

01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,600
types of contribution

01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,400
and i like to use a pretty standard

01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,960
frame

01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,960
which is time talent and treasure you

01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,239
want your contributions diversified in

01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,679
these three areas

01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:43,440
and this is a framework that comes from

01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,199
the nonprofit world and it applies

01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,120
pretty well to open source

01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:49,840
and the reality is is that when you

01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:52,639
focus on diverse contributions

01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,400
you actually get an even more diverse

01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:57,840
community member base

01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,440
so let me explain what i mean so diverse

01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,560
time and talent come in lots of

01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,840
different ways um like i mentioned

01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,719
before you don't want

01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,080
just to focus on code and of course you

01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,159
have to build code but a project

01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,600
requires so many other talents

01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:14,000
you need those tech writers to write

01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,080
documentation you need mentors

01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,639
to help people learn the contributor

01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:21,360
experience you need event planners to do

01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,000
meetups and conferences you need board

01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,120
members

01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,760
that have board experience

01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,639
and so many other talents you simply

01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,400
cannot

01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,760
have a successful project with just

01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,120
coders

01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:38,639
you also need to be mindful of

01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:41,679
where the contributions are coming from

01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:44,880
are they hobbyists are they

01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:46,880
um people that work for

01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,800
open source vendors using the project or

01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,159
end users using the project

01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,320
you really want to look across your

01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:54,239
ecosystem and all the different kinds of

01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,000
groups that make up your ecosystem

01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:59,760
and see if you have good representation

01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:03,199
from all of them contributing back

01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:05,440
and you also want to look at your global

01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:07,679
contribution

01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:09,360
it's important to get people from around

01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,239
the world to contribute

01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,639
so that you end up with an end product

01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:16,000
or an

01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:17,679
end project that serves a global base

01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,199
that will want to adopt this

01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:26,159
software and you um

01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:28,400
can really lower barriers when you have

01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,280
um more of a global community base so

01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,320
for example

01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,400
they can write translations so that end

01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,800
users around the world

01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,719
can really grab that software read the

01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,840
translated documentation

01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,840
and put it to good use

01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:46,320
so that's time and talent you further

01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,239
need to diversify

01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,600
with treasure and that just means

01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:51,920
funding so

01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,520
you need money for tools like servers

01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:56,400
like i mentioned before

01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,760
you might also want money for diversity

01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,000
scholarships

01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,760
you may want to pay maintainers and you

01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,400
need money to do that

01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,520
and it's really important to diversify

01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,400
the funds

01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,400
so you don't want to bring in money in

01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,199
just one way you don't want to rely just

01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,840
on event sponsorships for example

01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:17,440
ticket revenue we saw this with kova the

01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,320
projects that did rely on this too

01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,840
heavenly

01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:25,760
heavily found that

01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:28,639
they were really struggling for survival

01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,239
um and had to come up with new ways to

01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,920
fund their mission work

01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,280
and so you want to think about events

01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,199
but you want to think about memberships

01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:38,000
and donations and

01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:40,239
grants maybe you want to have a product

01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,480
and

01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:43,679
there's other things about treasure as

01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,719
well but

01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,560
when you diversify treasure

01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:50,639
time and talent and you think about that

01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,360
you ask what your project needs

01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,920
now and into the future you will start

01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:57,120
building

01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,920
in so much more resiliency into your

01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,199
project

01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,199
by diversifying

01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,239
this is how google thinks about

01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,719
sustainability

01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:10,000
and we put it to practice every day and

01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:13,360
that's because we use

01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,719
a lot of open source software we rely on

01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,080
it for our infrastructure and for the

01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:19,280
offerings we make

01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:22,639
out in the marketplace and so we

01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:24,719
take giving back very seriously

01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,639
it's the right thing to do and it also

01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,239
future proofs the open source projects

01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:31,360
we rely on

01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:33,120
and we have nearly 12 000

01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,920
googlers who are contributing to

01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,880
projects and that doesn't even include

01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,560
people beyond uh code and tech writer so

01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,960
it doesn't include

01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,760
our staff members that are serving on

01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,960
boards

01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:49,920
or planning events and

01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,120
we create thousands of open source

01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:54,800
projects and

01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:56,639
today we currently manage 2600 active

01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,600
projects

01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:01,199
and we rely on a lot of external

01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,400
projects as well

01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:08,239
and we're actually active in

01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:10,719
um 70 000 github repositories

01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:12,000
and it's it's a lot and we care about

01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:14,800
these projects too

01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,320
and make sure we give back we do so in

01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,920
lots of different ways and so i'll kind

01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,520
of just break down some of the ways that

01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,960
we are

01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,440
contributing to make open source

01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,560
sustainable so the first example

01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:27,679
is go a really popular language that was

01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,120
developed by go

01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:32,080
and it has a strong and growing

01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,080
community around it

01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:37,920
we have a group of people that are

01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,440
focused on sustainably stewarding the

01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,120
project and making sure everyone's

01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,000
working well together towards these

01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,320
common goals

01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,159
for go and one of the things that they

01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,760
found especially during cobit was that

01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:50,239
with this emphasis of online

01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,120
collaboration

01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,920
we needed to make the project more

01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,639
welcoming

01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,239
in these online forums and there really

01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,760
wasn't training and there

01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:02,960
you don't normally get this kind of

01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,480
training to learn how to moderate forums

01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,000
and when you do it poorly you can make

01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:09,679
some really bad experiences

01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:13,120
that are at worst toxic

01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:14,400
for the community and also just a real

01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,840
distraction from

01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,239
these common goals we want to achieve

01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,679
together you end up just focus too much

01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:21,840
on the daily drama

01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,000
we just didn't want that and so we

01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:27,199
invested in

01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,280
moderator training so that we could

01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:31,920
help moderators with effective

01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,639
communication conflict resolution

01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,679
code of conduct enforcement and we're

01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:38,880
really excited

01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:40,320
to empower these people to be much

01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,040
better leaders in these spaces

01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,400
and make sure we have a welcoming

01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:48,080
environment so that we

01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,360
can attract diverse community members

01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,440
and we're looking forward to rolling

01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:54,239
this out to other projects

01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,520
and tensorflow is another great example

01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,600
another project

01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,560
that was developed by google and has a

01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,800
community

01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:06,719
created around it and we

01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:08,719
intentionally wanted diverse

01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,360
community members as part of this

01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,199
project it does not do anyone good

01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,560
if it's just googlers working on this

01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,760
project we need input from

01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:20,480
so many perspectives and so we

01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,199
intentionally designed our governance so

01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:24,000
that our

01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:24,800
special interest groups always had a

01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,360
balance of

01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,040
googlers and those that don't work at

01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:32,320
google

01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:35,199
and that way decision making has much

01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:38,159
more perspective and balance

01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:41,920
and ensures that we are committed to

01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:41,920
having this diverse community base

01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:48,480
so we do provide these kinds of um

01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:51,600
services for the projects we

01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,639
create and manage but we also have lots

01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,120
of programs

01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,719
to help make projects sustainable both

01:30:55,120 --> 01:31:00,320
the ones we create

01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:03,520
the ones we rely on that we don't create

01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:05,120
and even ones we don't use and

01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,880
these programs we just want to share

01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,520
broadly because we care about

01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,280
open source the whole industry's

01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,360
sustainability and health

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,480
so a few projects or programs that you

01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:17,440
might want to check out

01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:20,159
are oss fuzz which uncovers security

01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:23,040
vulnerabilities and stability issues

01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:24,960
and we have google summer of code it's a

01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,000
long-standing mentoring program that

01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,040
gets students

01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,520
into projects and assigned to mentors so

01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:33,040
they learn how to contribute code well

01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:36,080
contribute right

01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:39,600
and it's resulted in a lot of leaders

01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:41,679
in open source projects and it brings in

01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,880
a lot of diverse and new talent

01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:46,239
into the projects as well another

01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,560
program to check out that's

01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,320
newer is season of docs it's a lot like

01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:53,440
summer of code but it's about matching

01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:55,280
tech riders to projects and

01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:57,679
making sure that these projects

01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,360
accelerate good documentation so they

01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,440
can grow adoption

01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,840
of their other software out in the

01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,880
marketplace within users

01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,760
and there's lots of other um programs

01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,400
that you can check

01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,840
out and you can go to opensource.google

01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,840
to find out what they are

01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:19,040
and so we have these long-standing

01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,600
programs and approaches

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,960
but we also know that things creep up

01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,840
these forces have changed

01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,400
like covet just come out of nowhere and

01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,760
we

01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:32,560
are uh this we attempt to be

01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,600
as nimble as we can to help out when

01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,040
these challenges

01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,880
arise so for kobe we did a couple things

01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:41,360
we reached out to the projects we rely

01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,560
on and simply said how can we help

01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,920
and we sent resources in to help where

01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,440
we could

01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:52,000
we also knew that many people

01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,880
had to take a break from their projects

01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,960
because

01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,280
they were suddenly doing child care or

01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,760
elder care or finding a new job

01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,800
so we transitioned our internship

01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,600
program to bring

01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:05,440
more students into projects and assign

01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,600
the mentor so they could

01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,719
take on some of the load of the work and

01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,719
also learn

01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:13,199
about open source and how that can be a

01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:15,760
future career path for them

01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:16,719
and then we also reached out to open

01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,880
source projects

01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,159
on the front lines and there were many

01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,440
that needed to accelerate

01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:25,920
features to make sure we were

01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,280
really serving the front lines well so

01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:31,440
we did a call out

01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:33,679
and many people within google came

01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,000
you know heard the call and came out and

01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:38,159
contributed time and talent

01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,440
to projects like coveted act now and

01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:44,960
next strain and schema.org

01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:48,480
and we also helped a lot of

01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:50,480
projects shift from in-person events

01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,840
to online events like this one we did it

01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,760
by creating a guide

01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,360
and sharing it broadly with the open

01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,400
source community

01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,960
so these are some things that we have

01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,960
done

01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:04,960
as google to help give back

01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,320
to the industry into the projects we use

01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,000
and rely on

01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:10,560
but it's really important to point out

01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,199
that we do not do this alone

01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,840
sustainability cannot be achieved by

01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:18,719
just one company or just one individual

01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,400
requires all of us working together and

01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,040
we are so grateful for

01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,920
all the partners that we work with to

01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:27,360
contribute back

01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,239
and make the industry and the projects

01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:32,719
we use

01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:35,520
sustainable and future proofed

01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:37,040
so these are you know the things that we

01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,960
do

01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,960
but if you want to get started and

01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,000
contributing to open source you can do

01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,679
it today

01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,199
and you don't need to be part of a big

01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,159
enterprise to

01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:49,920
make a difference everything counts so

01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:51,760
here are a few pro tips that you might

01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,440
want to try right away

01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:56,400
first is just going to the project you

01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,239
love and use and asking how can i help

01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,159
trust me people will point in the right

01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,639
direction but if you don't want to do

01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:04,320
that

01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:06,159
just go over and start answering issues

01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,760
or see if there's any languishing pr's

01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:10,400
that you can close out

01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,840
and you can always fund a project you

01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,840
could buy a membership

01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,480
you could donate you could even buy a

01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:20,320
t-shirt that kind of money helps too

01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,639
and you can look at our sustainability

01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:24,480
programs on opensource.google and see

01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,080
which ones might help your project and

01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,840
apply for all of them

01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,719
we're happy to share our resources and

01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,719
we really want to

01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:36,880
another pro tip is to learn more about

01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,560
sustainability and you can do so with

01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:41,920
this great

01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:43,440
um resource that nadia eggball wrote

01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,320
with the ford foundation called roads

01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,199
and bridges

01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:48,000
that really explains the basics of

01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:50,800
sustainability

01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,239
and so i hope you'll check that out i

01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,520
hope that you will

01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,520
start thinking of ways that you can

01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:59,360
contribute because like i said

01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:02,080
every little bit matters and this is how

01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,760
we keep open source alive today and into

01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:06,560
the future

01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,920
