Presented by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois.

ABSTRACT

The R Intergrouplet has invited long-time R contributors Dirk and Romain to give a joint tech talk about some of the recent developments on their open-source R packages. The Rcpp package provides a consistent C++ class hierarchy that maps various types of R objects to dedicated C++ classes. Object interchange between R and C++ is managed by simple, flexible, and extensible concepts which include broad support for popular C++ idioms from the Standard Template Library. RInside is used to embed R in C++ applications, and RProtobuf is the Protocol Buffers API for R.
