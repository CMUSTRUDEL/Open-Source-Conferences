ABSTRACT

MythTV is a powerful open source personal video recorder. It records television off the air, plays downloaded media files, DVDs, and audio files. It also includes a web browser, RSS reader, weather applet, and much more. During this talk Michael will introduce MythTV, show off the frontend interface, MythWeb, talk about the current challenges with guide data in the United States, and discuss some of the upcoming features. Michael is a coauthor of "Practical MythTV", which was published in April 2007.

Michael Still is currently a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. Before that, he was a senior software engineer at TOWER Software in Australia. For many...

good evening ladies and gentlemen and

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,200
welcome to the open source developers at

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,369
Google speaker series this evening we

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,710
are privileged to have with us Michael

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,330
still who is a mythtv developer in

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,860
addition to his responsibilities at

00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,630
Google as a site reliability engineer

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,730
and tonight Michael will be presenting

00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,650
on practical mythtv Michael take away

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,989
thank you so my microphone works right

00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:51,030
oh honey um okay so I thought I'd just

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,790
quickly start off by saying Who I am and

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,800
what I do here so I'm here because I

00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,059
happen to write a book on mythtv turns

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,530
out there's a couple of other books on

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,750
the subject so you know kind of whatever

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,040
and I'm a site reliability engineer here

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,199
at Google which means I'm some sort of

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,330
combination of a software engineer and a

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,950
Linux system admin I happen to work on

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,140
our the clusters that you know run

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,300
Google's publicly visible product

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,050
products yeah not really well that

00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,840
relevant so I thought tonight what we do

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,090
is I'll introduce mythtv breathe briefly

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,370
I'll talk about some of the stuff it

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,159
does in the currently released version

00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,409
then I'll talk about you know how you

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,330
set up set up some of it and you know

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,350
how you get going that kind of thing and

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,270
then I wanted to finish off by talking

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,380
about some of the features that are

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,850
coming up in the next release because

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,470
there's some reasonably cool stuff there

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,110
so let's get started so mythtv is an

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,110
open-source PVR package which means it's

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,850
a lot like say a TiVo or you know

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,620
there's a bunch of open-source PVR's it

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,350
turns out sage and a couple of others

00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,420
and what that means is it will record TV

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,040
off of the air and you can play it back

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,380
later whenever you want it's got all the

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,930
standard PVR features like rewind fast

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,670
forward causing live TV that kind of

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,740
stuff it's got a couple of unique

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,810
features that you wouldn't see and say a

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,060
TiVo like it can automatically skip

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,489
commercials it's got a web interface

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,379
that lets you stream videos wherever

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,379
that kind of thing so it's pretty cool

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,739
ah ok so the question question is is

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,120
there a rationale for the name mythtv

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,500
and what I should probably say is the

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,670
other the other thing is feel free to

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,310
interrupt and ask questions because

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,049
otherwise this will get really boring

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,209
it's a reference to the mythical

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,620
convergence pc so i think it was you

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,689
know back in the 90s people were talking

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,340
about how you know your lounge room

00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,719
would living room or whatever would

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,549
become one machine and that machine

00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,129
would do everything this was considered

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,519
a bit of a myth mythtv is that machine

00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:48,560
it yo plays videos it plays dvds it will

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,109
you know deal with you know streaming

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,090
audio and pre-recorded audio it does all

00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,500
of that kind of stuff in fact one of the

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,120
things I'll talk about later is the next

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,489
release will integrate with home

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,079
security systems and you can have closed

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,579
circuit video cameras around your house

00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,769
and have those pop up as a picture in

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,239
picture display that kind of thing so

00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,980
it's a reference to this mythical

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,129
convergence pc that people were talking

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,239
about a while ago so i think i've

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,489
mentioned that you know you can record

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,230
and playback TV you know you can do

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,780
audio and dvds and that kind of thing as

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,909
well another cool thing about mythtv is

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,349
it has a really strong plug-in system so

00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,449
in the user interface it's not always

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,190
obvious which bits are built in and

00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,680
which bits are plugins and it's actually

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,229
relatively easy to write new plugins so

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,669
for example there's a weather plugin

00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:33,439
that will tell you you know based on

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,870
weather comdata what the weather is like

00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,699
at the moment that's just a plug-in so

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,840
if you don't like how it works or if you

00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,669
think of something that you want to do

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,000
with myth it's reasonably easy to write

00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:45,620
new ones so I thought what I do is I'd

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,449
start off by having a poke around in

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,459
myth and seeing and showing you what it

00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,250
looks like catch of course is I have

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:57,579
like six machines here so hopefully this

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,579
will just work unless the screens off

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,470
okay so mythtv has two major components

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,290
there's a back end and a front end so if

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,580
we just start up the back end I'll

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,840
explain a little bit more what the back

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,840
end in the front end are in a minute

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,900
we'll ignore the message saying have you

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,359
really read the installation

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,200
instructions and then there's the front

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,940
end now the other thing I should say is

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,190
what I'm demonstrating here is the

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,170
latest development release in fact the

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,120
latest from two days ago so if it

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,370
crashes that's not actually indication

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,510
of the stability of the real release of

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,400
myth they've at the moment this is still

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,250
tiny bit flaky but it's got some cool

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,990
stuff I want to show you so mythtv has a

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,880
theme system so this it just happens to

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,800
be the theme a run at home you can pick

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,210
whatever you want and in fact it's also

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,320
reasonably easy to define your own

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,520
themes if none of them take your fancy

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,190
media library is where you go to watch

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,730
pre-recorded video so recordings are

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,610
things that came off of live TV so you

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,060
know your comcast cable or your dish TV

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,590
or you know free-to-air TV or whatever

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,140
videos are video files that came from

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,340
somewhere else for instance videos of

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,860
you kids running around the park that

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,740
came off a handycam or you know ripped

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,330
dvds that kind of thing an image gallery

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,400
is kind of what it sounds like play

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,050
games is interesting you can run classic

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,700
arcade games on myth because it

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,050
integrates with name and this is the

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,560
screen that shows you all the recordings

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:32,710
you have so what I want to do is I'm

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,710
just going to play a random recording

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,590
so this is actually a news report which

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,730
is why it's in black and white because

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,199
it's talking about some stuff that came

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,800
out of the Australian archives recently

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,530
you can skip ahead and back now the

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,840
video here is blocking because this is a

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,130
downloaded video in avi format and it's

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,440
waiting for a keyframe before it will

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,460
correct and the user interface is

00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:00,540
walking because it's matched the

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:03,479
resolution of the video number still

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,590
want to show you here that's the other

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,970
thing I wanted to show you that I kind

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,729
of missed there let's play a different

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,930
video for a second so one of the things

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,540
you can do is if you're playing and you

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,419
skip along and you have to walk away for

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,160
some reason then myth will optionally

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,310
ask you whether or not you want to save

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,389
where you're up to so if I select that

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,860
when i come back and watch that show it

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:28,289
will start up from that point again okay

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,789
so let's talk a little bit about myth

00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,800
itself yep I've got a switchback so as I

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,360
mentioned before mythtv has two major

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,669
components there's a back end and a

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,490
front and the back end is responsible

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,289
for capture stuff so it's the thing

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,460
that's controlling the tuner cards and

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,440
making sure that all your shows get

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,840
recorded it's also the part that talks

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,849
to a sequel database that records what

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,500
recordings you want at what time you

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,910
know you your preferences you can say

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,919
for instance that the simpsons is more

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,780
important than you know the family guy

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,250
and only get the same family guy if you

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,280
know you've got an idol tuner that kind

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,870
of thing and then you have front ends

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,880
and front ends are the way that video

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,169
gets displayed around the house so it

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,849
means for instance that you can have

00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,410
more than one back end if you know

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,260
heaven forbid you had so many tuners

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,460
they didn't all fit in one machine or

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,990
you know there's physical constraints

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,389
like you know you've got your dish TV in

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,740
one place and then you've got your

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,570
comcast in a different place you can run

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,030
two machines in different spots with

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,530
different capture cards and the front

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,030
and multiple front ends means you can be

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,039
playing back more than one video at once

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,930
so for instance at home I have four or

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,580
five front ends there's the one in the

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,710
living room the kids have one in their

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,020
bedrooms you know the laptops having and

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,250
that kind of thing so it's trivial to be

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,630
watching something in the living room

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,099
and watching something completely

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,340
different on a laptop somewhere else in

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,650
the house so the data is stored in two

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,950
places there's a my sequel database for

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,320
all them

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,030
data like program guides and what's been

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,800
recorded previously and your preferences

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,120
and that kind of thing and then there's

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,090
just a bunch of desk where you store

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,130
recordings that also includes things

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,720
like the videos you've downloaded and

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:05,520
you know mp3 files and that kind of

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,490
thing now the just a bunch of desk there

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,200
are a couple of caveats I use ext3 the

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,420
xt3 is not particularly efficient to

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,590
deleting large files so every time I

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,810
delete a recording there's a couple of

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,310
second pause there is an option you can

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,510
turn on that says hey delete these

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,790
things in the background but you'll

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,160
still experience a slight pause the

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,960
co-author for the book Stewart uses XFS

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,080
which is extents based which means it's

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,350
much faster at deleting large files ext4

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,220
will improve in this regard to but then

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,360
again you know it's true it's a little

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,490
bit biased because he worked on the team

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,280
that wrote XFS so I also said you can

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,780
playback DVDs with myth now it used to

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,540
be that what you'd use is an external

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,980
player and that still works excuse me

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,390
one second now the external players are

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,000
just command lines that get run when you

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,800
say hey please play a DVD so people in

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,950
the past would use E&M player and that

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,240
kind of thing now it's still possible to

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,520
do that if you have some special

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,140
requirement like neo DVDs in a weird

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,660
format that myth can't support or

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,220
whatever but these days you're probably

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,260
generally best off just using the

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,240
internal player the internal player is

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,220
based off in player and it's much nicer

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,450
than it used to be even one release ago

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,030
it wasn't particularly reliable yes yes

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,440
we'll get to that in a second it's much

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,180
nicer than it used to be in the previous

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,350
release for instance DVDs mean menus

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,820
didn't work now they just do and the

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,410
advantage of using the internal player

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,120
is all the remote control stuff maps

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,460
properly so one of the problems was that

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,760
you know mplayer didn't support menus

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,680
back back then I think it might now zeen

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,970
had different keyboard layouts all the

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,490
key controls would change if you're

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,900
playing a DVD if you use the internal

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,040
player than everything is consistent and

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,510
it just works and I think I've kind of

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,240
said all of that uh yeah an encrypted

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,120
dvds work although you have to install

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,170
lib dee dee dee CSS which depending on

00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,880
your distribution may or may not be

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,330
shipped you might need to you know

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,920
download it separately and install it so

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:12,270
i thought i'd show you that working as

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:13,920
well one thing i forgot to show you

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,350
earlier actually so information center

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,190
is where the plugins hope so for

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,350
instance this is a movie x plugin that

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:27,150
isn't going to immediately work that's a

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,320
shame oh ok it's talking on the network

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:33,330
and this machine's not networked at the

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,070
moment oh yes cuz it's not on the

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:43,110
network oh yeah crash let's pretend that

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:44,670
didn't happen stable version yes the

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,050
current stable version of the internal

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,810
player is good enough i've been using a

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:55,160
home for probably a year now and it just

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:55,160
works so this is the internal DVD player

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:03,600
which will work when i ask it nicely oh

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,160
it's gonna be one of those days this all

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,180
worked of course this morning yeah

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,180
that's interesting

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,810
that's his life

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,300
um I don't know I think that makes it

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,380
happy so the question was why are there

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,360
two slashes but I think the problem is

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,960
actually that the doc on the laptop is

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,240
unhappy I think the Machine didn't

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,590
detect that it was docked when because

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm demoing on a laptop not a real

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,170
computer okay we'll go back to that demo

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,480
and what I might do is when I'm talking

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,310
on the next slide I'll arm I'll quickly

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:51,990
reboot the machine and prove to you that

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:54,680
that works so nobody look just bear with

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,680
me for a second

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,779
okay so we'll leave that starting up and

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,899
we'll go talk about something else for a

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,899
bit

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,080
okay so the other thing I wanted to talk

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,930
about is commercial detection so mythtv

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,030
can now automatically detect commercials

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,100
and it and it will skip them if you want

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,320
it to that's configurable so what

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,060
happens is again configure ibly once a

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,410
recording has finished or once a

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,450
significant chunk of a recording has

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,220
happened this is commercial detection

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,450
program that runs on the video file and

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,340
what it does is it goes through and it

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,590
finds all the starts of the commercials

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,420
in the ends and it will map those and

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,590
then when you're playing back when it

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,970
reaches one of those will just skip to

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,800
the marker that says here's the end of

00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,810
the commercial the commercial detection

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,820
is actually very reliable much more

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,620
reliable than I thought it was the only

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,360
problem I've really experienced is if

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,620
you've got a show that's very dark for

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,060
instance you know law and order has lots

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,800
of those black scenes that say hey we've

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,840
changed to the county court or whatever

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,150
it tends to have problems with that kind

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,530
of stuff then again it's really easy in

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,360
the menu system to say hey for this

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:21,320
recording don't use commercial detection

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,850
and it's also really easy to disable it

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,080
for a show forever you can say hey never

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,440
with law and order use commercial

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,960
detection now the other thing you can do

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,050
is you can convert those detected

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,600
commercials to a cut list cut lists how

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,340
you edit videos in mythtv so for

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,840
instance you can say now that you've

00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,610
detected commercials and I trust you

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,020
that you're going to get it right remove

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,480
them forever and save me some disk space

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,860
which is kind of cool you can also use

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,390
cutlass to do stuff like if you're

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,350
recording you know a sports game and you

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,360
don't really know when it's going to end

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,560
once you've recorded it you can go to

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,090
the end of the actual game and say hey

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,030
throw away everything after this and

00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:58,910
myth uses a lossless transcode system

00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,770
for that so it's a little bit

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,110
complicated what happens with most video

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:08,930
formats is every now and then there's a

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:12,410
keyframe it's normally every few seconds

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:16,490
and then in between the keyframes they

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,590
just store differences in the image now

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,940
that makes the files much smaller what

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:24,140
happens when you're transcoding is if

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,420
you see chopped here let's say we're

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,220
going to chop this party up here we've

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,680
lost a key frame so myth needs to go

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,050
through and generate a new keyframe that

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,360
new keyframe won't be as good as the

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,730
original one because the compression

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,260
systems they use throw away data that

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,040
you can't get back it's called lossy

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,769
compression

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,839
so for this small portion you'll find

00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,070
that the image quality isn't as high but

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,720
it's probably not something you're going

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,190
to notice on a normal television anyway

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,170
because the televisions tend to be fuzzy

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,459
and again it's just going to be for this

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,170
yeah this is probably a couple of

00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:58,880
seconds so most people don't really care

00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,350
about that kind of stuff so let's see if

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:14,029
my other machine has come back from

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:15,649
being kicked in the shin okay so the

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:18,139
algorithm is reasonably complex they do

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,240
stuff like they look for the station

00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,860
logos that are at the bottom of sorry I

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,050
should go back and say what the question

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,170
was how does commercial detection work

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,339
and basically what they do is they look

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,230
for the station logo at the bottom of

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,569
the image they look for black frames

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,610
which often appear in between the

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:36,319
commercials and the advertising and I

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,329
believe they also look for the intensity

00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:40,639
of the image like often you know ads

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,529
will be brighter than you know the show

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,339
or whatever so there's a bunch of stuff

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:48,079
they do to try and detect that yeah i'm

00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:50,029
not sure if they use volume or not to be

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:58,370
honest but i wouldn't be surprised if

00:15:50,029 --> 00:16:01,370
they do no i don't believe that the

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,350
route that the TV stations actually mark

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,970
commercials because that's probably not

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,730
in their best interests and it's also

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,019
not consistent globally right so you

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,810
know commercial detection works kind of

00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:14,630
everywhere i'm going to have one of

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,910
those days i know is there any special

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,300
magic i have to do to get and maybe if i

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,779
select the right machine will work oh

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,779
they were there we go

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,180
special man yeah it's pressing the right

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,310
button but it's one of those things

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,630
right you do these demos at your desk 14

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,490
times during the day and they all just

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,920
work by definition when you get in front

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:52,060
of people they will fail in some

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:53,589
unexpected manner that's why you should

00:16:52,060 --> 00:17:02,020
never do demos in front of actual people

00:16:53,589 --> 00:17:04,689
i think yes you'd only have robots to

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,850
demo in front of so let's just start

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:09,429
meth up again this is running at a lower

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,110
resolution because the Machine detected

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,949
the wrong resolution when it started up

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,949
but that's okay

00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:27,020
okay so as promised that I play you a

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:33,050
DVD let's see if the DVD drove on the

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:34,220
machine is happy now there we go so one

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,170
of the cool things about the DVD player

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,030
is it also doesn't honor the no-fly

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:42,140
regions a low disk say hey you can't

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,310
skip this bit you can in myth so all of

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,550
this boring stuff I don't care about

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:53,330
that's all good so we can start playing

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:55,010
a DVD and the menus just work so let's

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,450
turn on subtitles the subtitles in this

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,090
are actually quite funny because there

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:06,440
are not English there an alien for

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:09,710
reasons I can't fully explain yeah so

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,550
the subtitles are in crazy alien but

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,660
anyway so a DVD playback really does

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:19,120
work what was I meant to be showing you

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,120
know that's right commercial detection

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,070
so if we go back to my victim recording

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,000
my notes say that about six minutes

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,000
there's a commercial

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,789
ya know if I'm sorry I've just had a

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:45,169
request from the nice man ronke this is

00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:50,600
pause for a second I can never remember

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:54,530
where I set screen resolution hey Andrew

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,669
where do I set screen resolution oh yeah

00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:01,900
yeah okay right under screen resolution

00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,900
my machine doesn't like you anymore okay

00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:08,840
well we're just going to keep going so

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,000
at about six minutes there's advertising

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,010
I believe lamb there we go so I'd skip

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,039
two minutes of video because if we go

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,039
back there was some random ad

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,179
so so far i've talked about you know

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,990
that there's a back end there's a front

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,159
end records video yo yo yo the next we

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,460
don't want to talk about is user jobs

00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,460
yeah

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,540
front end

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,500
mm-hmm

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,150
okay so the question was with the front

00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,370
end be confused by the resolution

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,410
changing on the fly the answer is it

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,790
depends how it's compiled if it's got XR

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:07,800
and are installed it'll just handle it

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,450
so it should have just worked I think

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,890
the problem is that the laptop detected

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,480
what resolution the screen could do when

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,990
it started up and the screen for some

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,100
reason said something horrible okay so

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,930
the next we don't want to talk about is

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,660
user jobs so once the recording has

00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,790
finished myth has this ability to run

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,100
arbitrary scripts and they're called

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,000
user jobs so for example one of the

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,590
things I do is I do a reasonable amount

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,410
of flying and I tend to watch videos on

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,050
planes so this is a nokia n800 it's just

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,390
a little handheld tablet thing and so I

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,040
have a user job that will transco my

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,020
video formats to the correct format for

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,570
that device you can also do it for ipods

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,140
playstation portable 'he's you know I

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,300
phones whatever and all the user job is

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,800
is just a command line that gets run

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,990
with arguments passed in so the

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,660
arguments are things like the location

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,490
the video is at on desk the title of the

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,820
video the subtitle that kind of thing

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,470
and that makes them pretty cool things

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,150
possible now most of the examples i'm

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,090
going to talk about a transcoding but

00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,250
you can do other things as well so one

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,070
of the cool things is nerve export now

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,730
the export is one of the several ways

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:21,420
you can convert video formats from what

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,700
meth users which is often mpeg-2 various

00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,010
formats suitable for other devices it

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,690
gets its name because depending on the

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,950
hardware you use myth will sometimes

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,380
store the videos in a format called

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,400
Apple video which has nuv as its

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:37,110
extension so another exports reasonably

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,060
hard to get going I ended up having to

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,160
patch the code so there's also a patch

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,290
at my site if you decide to go this

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,690
route and you need a new version of

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,690
ffmpeg for our ipods to work properly

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,770
now i mentioned that the command lines

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,420
have these flags you can pass in so

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,980
these are probably the four most useful

00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,980
flags although there are others as well

00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,390
so another export is overkill if all you

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,820
want to do is stuff like permanently

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,140
removing the commercials mythtv comes

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,910
with its own transcode

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,360
location called myth transcode that does

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,680
that cool lossless transcoding thing and

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,560
again it's just a command line that you

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:21,540
run but because these user jobs are just

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,520
command lines you can run random things

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,050
so if for instance you really really

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,370
cared about a particular show and you

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,320
wanted to get an email when a new one

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,110
had been recorded you could do that or

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,720
if for instance you know you wanted to

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,610
copy the video file from where myth puts

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,810
it on disk to the right place for it

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,430
automatically get synced with your

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,770
laptop you can do that kind of stuff as

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:45,000
well you can do basically anything you

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,900
can do in a shell script so I guess what

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,340
I'm trying to say is don't limit

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,320
yourself to just transcoding there's

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,080
some reasonably cool stuff you can do

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,760
with this the next release of mythtv

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,040
will also let you execute these with the

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,350
delay so the example they're using is

00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,180
let's say you record everything in you

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,310
know high definition those files tend to

00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,990
be pretty big and you go away for a

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,790
while now hard disk starts filling up

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,160
you can set rules in the next release

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,990
like if I haven't watched this video for

00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,900
seven days then transcode it to a

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,250
smaller format doesn't look as good

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:20,670
which means you still have the show but

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:21,900
you're not using up so much disk so I

00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,000
mentioned before that you can have more

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,860
than one front end now setting up remote

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,180
front ends is really easy what you do is

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,980
you just install the binaries like you

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,990
would normally and in the configuration

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,300
program which is normally called mythtv

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,000
setup although some distributions rename

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,910
that you just change the database

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,200
configuration to point to the back end

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,600
now at the moment you can run front ends

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,890
on linux and mac OS there has been some

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,210
work to get them working on windows

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,610
that's been going for a couple of years

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,680
and they don't have a good finished

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,050
product yet but maybe they will sometime

00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,080
soon it's not clear to me that it really

00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,150
matters because the web interface that

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,230
ships with the new version means you're

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,330
probably not going to want to run as

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,900
many front ends anyway and I'll show you

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,310
that in a little bit and I've also said

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,780
you can have more than one back end and

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,670
that's pretty easy to when you install

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,980
the second back end you just tell it

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,330
it's a slave in the configuration

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,740
application and tell it where the master

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,180
is and they'll go and negotiate amongst

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,540
themselves about who's going to record

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,310
what when you can also use the extra

00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,970
back ends if you end up doing so much

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,770
transcoding

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,770
you need more cpus that kind of thing

00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,720
you can also control your front ends

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,250
over the network which initially doesn't

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,919
sound all that useful but I found a

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,720
couple of ways that I think it's cool so

00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,539
it makes a whole bunch of remote things

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,000
much nicer so what I'll do is I'll start

00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,919
off by showing you the telnet interface

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,340
which is the default way that you

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:55,890
control it over the network is that font

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:59,700
big enough can you see that now the

00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,260
catch with the telnet interface is that

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,890
there's no authentication or encryption

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:08,780
you're just you know but you can do a

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:12,539
bunch of really interesting things like

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:18,090
key down you can see that it's moving

00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:21,120
down the menu or key enter which will

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:24,929
start the video playing maybe we want to

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,340
pause it you know that kind of thing so

00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:27,750
this is cool if it's inside your house

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,309
but you wouldn't want to let this out on

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,030
the internet right because random people

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:35,809
are going to do bad things to your TV so

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,809
I have

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:47,080
now interesting just a second this is

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,419
going to need network so let's just

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,220
bring the network up so I have an

00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,780
instant messaging interface that I use

00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,929
instead that means I can instant message

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,520
my TV from work and tell it to do stuff

00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,200
my wife finds its really annoying

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:08,710
because I'll be controlling the front

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:11,260
end while she's trying to watch TV let

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:24,159
me just find my notes so I don't forget

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:25,809
to tell you anything kind of so the

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,659
question is can you do fuzzy matching

00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:30,400
stuff like you can on tivo and the short

00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:33,100
answer is is if you can express it in

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,750
sequel then yes so there's this advanced

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,030
recording mode where you can say hey

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,549
record any show that matches this sequel

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,559
expression so for instance you could say

00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:43,990
now record any show that contains the

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,570
word Google in the description for

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,039
instance but it's you know it doesn't do

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,720
anything like you know hey you like

00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,240
action shows so I'll start recording

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,230
this random other one so it doesn't have

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,950
anything like that i'm going to have one

00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,950
of those days on

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,240
we're going to talk about guide data a

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,210
little bit later because it's about to

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,620
change in the US as well in a way that

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,620
doesn't have absolutely everybody happy

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:29,630
actually we can just do that I know

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:31,730
that's not what I want sorry because we

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:35,710
rebooted the machine we ended up in this

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,710
no network so anyway so

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,830
so this is just a little Python

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,420
googletalk bot it connects to the google

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,600
talk network with an account that i use

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,010
for controlling my pc at home so i guess

00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:01,070
you know you guys can control my pc at

00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:05,120
home now too and if we just start up an

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,510
instant messaging client and let it

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,510
connect

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,810
and we'll get rid of that because this

00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:16,610
boring I can now do exactly what I could

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:22,780
do on the telnet interface but over

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:24,740
instant messages so for instance yeah

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:30,260
that's right it probably wants to know

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:35,120
who i am i can unpause I can also do

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:37,040
other stuff like I can do on screen

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,540
display stuff that's a really low

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,880
resolution because this video is at a

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,650
low resolution but so the actual reason

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,040
I wrote this was so i could tell my wife

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:51,710
that I was leaving work now and not

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,880
after ring her all the time so there we

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,710
go so you can also control it with

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,000
instant messages which is probably a

00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,150
little bit gratuitous but i thought was

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,150
fun

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:10,519
yes it's actually there's actually a

00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,379
slide somewhere in here here we go the

00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,230
next slide yeah so you can get that from

00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:16,909
my sight again in fact i'll put the

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,399
slide deck for this talk up there later

00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:24,350
so you may or may not want to write that

00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:26,029
down i don't mind so I've done that I've

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,830
kind of already showed you on screen

00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:30,440
displays the telnet interface doesn't

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:33,259
let you do on screen displays there's a

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,139
separate tool to do that which I'll

00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:38,480
quickly show you and again it's yet

00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:40,159
another command line so let me just flip

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,249
to the page for don't fat finger it and

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,539
make a fool of myself yet again now the

00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:47,179
catch with on screen displays is you

00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:55,159
have to be playing a video for them to

00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:58,629
work but we will that's not that no by

00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,629
definition will be the last one right

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,549
I'm just gonna open a new one

00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:15,440
so mythtv on-screen display let's use

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,440
the alert template

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,340
and so you can just display on the

00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,770
screen displays with command line so I

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,950
know people who do stuff like you know

00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,820
detect that their CPU is running hot and

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,290
will pop something up on the screen

00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,020
saying hey you know the machines heart

00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,070
or you're running out of disk or you

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,540
know it's a little bit weird that you

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,970
haven't fed the cat in the last month

00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,320
maybe you should consider caring for

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:48,220
your animals adequately that kind of

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:49,750
thing and so I think the last demo I

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,660
wanted to do is I want to show you myth

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,420
web which is the web interface now back

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,300
when I used a TiVo there was no real

00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:03,040
equivalent to this now it's entirely

00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:06,100
possible there is now though so we'll

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:10,270
just start up a browser I don't care

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:14,070
about my old session so myth web lets

00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:21,960
you do basically anything you can do

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:21,960
with the front end in a web browser

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:32,700
so for instance these are the recordings

00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,700
that I have on the machine at the moment

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,840
now again this is the latest release so

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,700
it has some stuff you won't see if you

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,750
just download the standard release at

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:54,160
the moment one of the things that I

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:56,380
think is insanely cool there's a put no

00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,270
it's not

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:03,940
oh there we go sorry it was just slow to

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:09,790
load and I'm impatient have you gone oh

00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:11,230
here we go so the latest the next

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,710
release of meth TV so the latest

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:18,160
development versions have what I'm going

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,230
to call a YouTube like flash player so

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,880
this can stream video from your house to

00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:26,110
your desk at work and people will still

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,130
think you're working and this is

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,570
actually really interesting what it's

00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,950
doing is it's transcoding the video on

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,620
the fly to the right format for the

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:35,620
flash player it won't do any of the

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,030
stuff like a commercial skipping but if

00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,770
you're you know stuck in an airport or

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:45,900
something in a hotel it's probably good

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:48,550
enough so as I said before myth web is a

00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,230
web interface that lets you do anything

00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,800
that you can do in a front end so it

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:57,460
seems to me that I'm reasonably

00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,510
frequently actually this won't work

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,280
because there's no guide data on this

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,600
machine reasonably frequently they'll be

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,310
sitting you know at lunch and someone

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,990
will say hey did you see blah and I'll

00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,060
never have heard of that show because I

00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,070
live under a rock or something and I'll

00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,350
say no but sounds great so I'll just sit

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,270
there on my cell phone and start you

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,460
know recording it automagically for you

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,810
next time I get home so never again will

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,180
I be left out of lunch time

00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,940
conversations about the amazing amount

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,800
of TV Guide record but never watch and

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,630
you know you can review can set up

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,100
recordings you can play recordings you

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,750
can delete recordings you can do all of

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,750
that kind of stuff in the web interface

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,080
now one of the catches with myth web is

00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,270
that it doesn't have particularly

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,730
excellent security it just uses HT

00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,679
access so your username and password are

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,059
sent in the clear so that might be

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,309
something to consider when you set it up

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:53,020
but it's just a PHP application you can

00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:57,549
get it running in about five minutes so

00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:59,919
I've already done that now there's some

00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:01,870
other things I wanted to mention now it

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,520
seems to me that long term people are

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,549
going to probably stop getting TV from

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,260
traditional sources like you've got this

00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:09,520
comcast thing or whatever at the moment

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,379
that you know it's very old fashioned

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,760
right some do digs a hole and drags a

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:13,929
cable to your house and you plug it into

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,369
this thing on your back your machines

00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:20,230
very limiting there's a couple of ways

00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:21,700
you can integrate things like YouTube

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,599
and Google video and other video sites

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:27,669
into myth one of them I wrote so clearly

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,399
I think it's cool it's called myth net

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:32,740
TV it lets you take RSS and atom feeds

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,720
it downloads them and then insert some

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,859
it's recording this instead of videos so

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,929
you get the full recording user

00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:42,790
interface so you know I mentioned before

00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,080
that some of my test videos or almost

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:49,389
all of my test videos are downloaded so

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,609
the ABC ABC 730 report is a news program

00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:55,510
from Australia that I miss so I now just

00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:58,240
download that oh I missed you know

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,790
diggnation is another online show that I

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,880
download Elephants Dream is interesting

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:08,560
because it's an open source video made

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:12,070
with open source packages that you can

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,630
just download for free but so myth net

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,339
TV is just this tool that lets you

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:18,270
import videos into myth so they look

00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:18,270
like normal recordings

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,559
the family over a bit boring so it

00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,660
doesn't support bitter at the moment it

00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,099
uses HTTP the problem with bittorrent is

00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,990
I'm not really sure when you should end

00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,849
a recording right the BitTorrent clients

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,369
like hanging around and seeding other

00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:38,079
downloads so if you did that then you'd

00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,720
end up with all these BitTorrent clients

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,630
seeding other people all the time which

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,829
is probably you know socially

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,329
responsible but it's kind of Italy or

00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:48,819
bandwidth forever it's hard to detect

00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,900
when a when a download is finished but I

00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:52,930
might be wrong on that I haven't really

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,890
played with bittorrent all that much the

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,540
other problem with bittorrent is

00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,430
discovery right I'm not aware of any

00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,650
kind of you know RSS feed of things you

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,210
might want from bittorrent so you need

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,349
some way of discovering the downloads

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:07,990
before you start downloading them

00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:10,119
automatically so I showed you a video

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:13,990
that was downloaded that way but I

00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:17,520
thought I'd also show you now at the

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,520
moment is just a command-line tool

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,480
so this is a list of the subscriptions I

00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:29,640
have on this machine it's just in the

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,930
form of a text description which is a

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,109
show title that appears in the user

00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:39,210
interface and a URL to an RSS or atom

00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:40,680
feed and then you know you can say stuff

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,319
like hey go download me another show

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,859
this one happens to be coming from our

00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,359
Google's public Tech Talk series and it

00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:50,760
will download this it will then transfer

00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,690
to the right format if it needs to then

00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,010
we'll put it in the right place and

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,599
build a speak table and it will also

00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,550
detect commercials on these recordings

00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:09,300
so if some of them have ads it can be

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:10,440
skipped two yeah okay um the question is

00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,970
am I going to talk about you know the

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,859
hardware side and the integration that

00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,180
kinda thing I wasn't explicitly this

00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,130
talk was originally a three hour

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,309
tutorial at a conference kind of been

00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,500
pared down to an hour of which we've

00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:24,359
been through about 40 minutes but I'll

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:33,390
talk briefly at the end if you want just

00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:40,170
remind me if I forget oh yeah my life is

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:41,099
my research okay yeah but so I guess

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,900
it's more of a statement than a question

00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,579
it would be nice to use my row I've

00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,920
never seen it so maybe if you show it to

00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:49,190
me afterwards or something okay cool

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,190
alright

00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,270
so now that I've convinced you that

00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,000
mythtv is cool you have a couple of

00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:02,460
installation options there are packages

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,320
for most Linux distributions there's

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,400
definitely one fedora fedora there's

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,040
definitely one for Debian there's

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,050
definitely one for you bun to you can

00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,400
compile from source which is actually a

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,830
good option even though it sounds a bit

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,910
scary there's lots of websites and a

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,860
couple of books that will tell you how

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,480
to compile from source the advantage of

00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,460
that is you end up with codes that's

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,260
optimized for your CPU and your video

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,690
card and that kind of stuff which can be

00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,180
advantageous you can get live CDs now

00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:29,070
which are cool too so you know you

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,800
basically put a CD in the Machine and

00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,420
blam you've got a TV and a lot of these

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,590
CDs will also optionally install under

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,810
the hard disk if you want to keep it

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:42,990
forever so some of the new stuff that's

00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,130
coming in the next release and you know

00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,360
I think I've already shown some of this

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,040
already I haven't gone through the

00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,020
complete changelog recent recently

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,030
because it's like you know an inch thick

00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,310
but some of the cool stuff that really

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,510
jumps out is there's now clocks in menus

00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,940
which I thought was nice even though

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,460
it's little thing the watch list is cool

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,370
what happens is when you play a

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,380
recording myth decides what type what

00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,580
doesn't decide it determines what time

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,620
of day you played it and whether or not

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,150
you played it to the end and it starts

00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,370
suggesting recordings you'd like to

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:14,070
watch at that time of day again so if

00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,900
you always come home and unwind with an

00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,760
episode of something then when you get

00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,960
there but watch list will say hey I've

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,520
noticed you really like watching this

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,740
thing at this time of day so how about

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,790
we watch some of that and then maybe the

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,320
kids watch something different at

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,320
lunchtime and it will just magically

00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,970
know that which is kind of cool storage

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,040
directories are interesting in the

00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:35,610
current release of mythtv videos are

00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,110
always stored in one location that's not

00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,340
always true in the next release you can

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,840
configure different directories for

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,540
different recordings and stuff like that

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,280
so you could for instance say I really

00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,230
really care about these shows put them

00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,300
on the raid array I don't care so much

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,790
about these ones put them on the USB

00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,350
disk that's a little bit flaky or you

00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,290
can set up rules and say hey you know

00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:56,820
you can put videos on you know the

00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,440
petition that has my home directories

00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,630
but only so much I don't want you to

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,000
fill it and put everything else over

00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,950
here and it's reasonably smart it can do

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,779
stuff like move stuff move videos

00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,909
between directories to balance out load

00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,109
kind of thing which is kind of cool

00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:11,429
because at the moment if you want to

00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:13,799
solve videos in more than one place you

00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:15,479
have to move them and symlink them or

00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:16,529
poke around in the database to tell it

00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:19,049
that they're in a different spot that

00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:20,549
kind of thing there's the flash player

00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,769
and with myth web which I've shown you

00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:24,749
and there's a universal plug and play

00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:26,939
support which means a lot of these

00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:28,529
little devices and you can buy things

00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:31,079
that look a bit like a VCR except they

00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:32,279
have no holes on them to the there are

00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,900
all these devices that talk on the

00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:36,269
network and just ask the network nicely

00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,579
if there are any sources of content out

00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:40,589
there like audio or video a mythtv can

00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,909
now do that kind of stuff as well so a

00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:43,409
lot of these devices you can just buy

00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,150
you plug it into your TV and it says oh

00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:46,849
I've noticed this video over there would

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,719
you like to watch some of that and

00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:50,130
there's a bunch more like I said the

00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,779
changelog is about an inch thick these

00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:56,999
days now I really should talk about

00:40:54,779 --> 00:41:00,209
guide data a bit and this is complicated

00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:02,359
so I'm going to sit down so this only

00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:08,459
really applies to the US Canada and

00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:09,959
Venezuela I think it is the guide data

00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:12,809
for mythtv and a bunch of open source

00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:15,659
stuff was provided for quite a while for

00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:17,819
free by a company called the zap2it who

00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:19,409
had you know their labs site where you

00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:21,539
can download this guy data for free as

00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:23,429
apt to is owned by a company called

00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:25,380
Tribune media services which it turns

00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:27,929
out there's basically two sources of

00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,209
guide data in the US Tribune and another

00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:31,829
company I can't remember the name of now

00:41:30,209 --> 00:41:34,019
those companies value-add is they take

00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:35,699
all these data feeds from all the

00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:38,609
different TV affiliates and stuff and

00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:40,259
they unrolled them so they do stuff like

00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:42,959
they put in descriptions of the shows

00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:44,309
they make the spelling consistence that

00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,229
kind of stuff and then basically

00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:47,819
everybody else buys the data off them

00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:51,959
because they've got lots of humans doing

00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:53,999
this particular horrible job and they

00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,140
recently announced it was probably a

00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,519
couple of months ago now that they're

00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,439
going to stop providing this guy data

00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,519
for free they felt there was some abuse

00:41:58,439 --> 00:42:01,199
occurring and they're just going to turn

00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,619
off the site and I think it's the first

00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,029
4 sep tember big panic thousands of

00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,369
emails on a mailing list blah blah blah

00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:11,819
blah blah eventually it comes down to

00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:13,529
the guys who wrote myth and people

00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:15,839
associated with a bunch of other open

00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:17,249
source projects like XML TV have gotten

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,349
together and started a company called

00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:20,250
schedules direct and this company is

00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:21,900
going to provide this

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,700
guide data instead they've actually

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,940
signed a license agreement with Tribune

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,530
media services the catch of course is

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,090
they're going to have costs in hosting

00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,550
it so it's no longer going to be free

00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,920
it's going to be almost free I think

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,120
they're talking at the moment about for

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,800
the first quarter I think they want

00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,330
twenty dollars for three months and then

00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,220
they'll change the pricing based on how

00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,360
many people actually sign up and they

00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,980
they're saying they're going to try and

00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,450
iterate down to it being as close to

00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,070
free as they can get while still paying

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,270
their costs since they don't know how

00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,320
many people are actually going to use it

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,570
and how much it's actually going to cost

00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,520
and that kind of stuff so there is a

00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,110
guide data solution but we're in this

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,570
transition phase they haven't started

00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,280
providing go data yet and zap2it is

00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,660
going to stop providing it soon so

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,400
there's still a little bit of panic on

00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,080
the mailing lists but i think you know

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,020
long-term there'll be a real solution of

00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,970
this I was talking to a guy a couple of

00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,250
hours ago and my advice to him is

00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,930
probably don't build a box this week I

00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,520
would wait a couple of weeks and see how

00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:21,750
things sort themselves out and then

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:24,150
decide what to do yeah so the question

00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,270
is why did zap2it do it for free the

00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:30,210
short answer is not very short to be

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:32,310
honest the way guide data happens in a

00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,620
lot of other countries is a technique

00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:37,050
called screen scraping you get a web

00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,730
client you hit the web page like you

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,160
know for instance yahoo has a TV Guide

00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,170
site that's quite nice and you parse the

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,390
HTML and decide what shows are on when

00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,560
and then you know that probably doesn't

00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,150
have the description so then you click

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,890
on every link for every show to get the

00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:54,170
description and you know thousands of

00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:56,430
hits later you have the guide data the

00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,600
attitude that most companies have taken

00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,980
to that is they yell at you and

00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,510
threatened to sue you if you don't stop

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
because it turns out they're using lots

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,070
of bandwidth it's not very nice to their

00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,360
machines etc zap2it said hey why don't

00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:09,690
we just give you the data in a form that

00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,280
doesn't suck and off they went now

00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,960
ultimately you know that didn't work out

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,550
because you know one of the complaints

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,560
they had was that people were selling

00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,960
machines with mythtv installed that all

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,700
used one account and the accounts have

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,380
attributes like hey please get your guy

00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,120
data at this time of day so they can

00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,680
even out the load but that didn't work

00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,790
if there are a thousand machines all

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,680
using the same username and password so

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:33,780
you know I think we're going to iterate

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,050
to a solution that's reasonably good it

00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,760
might

00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,320
take a little time the other thing is if

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,270
schedules director doesn't work out

00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,370
there's no reason that we can't go back

00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,110
to screen scraping it's just someone

00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,520
would have to write the code and whoever

00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:54,210
get screen scraped is probably not going

00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:55,650
to be very happy about it yeah so that's

00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,970
true so is that too its business model

00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,970
is they provide this data to other

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,650
people for lots of money now they gave

00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,120
it out to the community for free and for

00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,850
whatever reason and I guess it's their

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,740
right to they've decided not to so there

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,150
has been you know some accusation on the

00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,880
mythtv mailing list there's a hidden

00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,620
agenda here and you know whatever but

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,030
yeah ultimately it's their data they can

00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:20,250
withhold it if they want to I suppose

00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:22,530
yeah so we're channels in information go

00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,120
to go to your room so they just treated

00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,000
like normal TV channels with the zap2it

00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:29,310
data I assume that will be true of the

00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,870
schedules direct data as well one of the

00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,280
things the schedule directs guys have

00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,410
said is because they've signed a

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,420
contract and they're giving TMS money

00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,390
they also get a little bit more control

00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,630
so they have a contractual ability to

00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,350
say hey we need the data format changed

00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,450
because we're giving you lots of money

00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,650
and you know they stand a lot more

00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,730
chance of getting a change than just

00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:52,200
random people who are getting it for

00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:54,170
free so I think the takeaway is despite

00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,860
all the panic there will be guide data

00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:59,160
we're pretty sure it will come from

00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,420
schedules direct you know hey I think

00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:08,520
some patience is required and that's

00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:10,320
about it so Oh get up again ah so that's

00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,390
the end of my slides now you asked about

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,730
hardware right but if you got a quick

00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,290
question first really if you don't have

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,750
to

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:21,080
you can schedule recordings according to

00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:23,060
time and channel yes so so the question

00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,650
was about manual scheduling it's a lot

00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,660
like a TiVo if you don't have TiVo guy

00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,360
data then you can say hey record at this

00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:31,310
time on this channel for this length you

00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,140
can do that with myth as well you won't

00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,580
get any of the guide data information so

00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,710
the system won't know what the show is

00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,420
named or anything like that but absolute

00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,130
worst case if you really really cared

00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,780
about a show you could start reading

00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:48,590
dead tree or something and setting up

00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:51,170
manual recordings yeah so the question

00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,160
was about hardware now one of the

00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,150
reasons I didn't want to talk about

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,340
hardware is it's different for everybody

00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:00,050
every video card is different every

00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,730
remote control system is different and

00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,070
some of them are fiddly and some of them

00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,590
just great so for instance I had a lot

00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,940
of trouble getting lir see which is the

00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,190
standard way of doing remote control

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,690
working but then i bought a fancy media

00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,280
center case like one of these home

00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,370
theater pc cases that had an inbuilt

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,780
infrared remote and that just worked so

00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:20,000
it kind of depends on your experience

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,200
your best bet is to look at the myth

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
site and see what hardware is

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,310
recommended I won't recite the list

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,780
because it's long most people in in the

00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:30,190
u.s. at least end up with a whole page

00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:33,290
capture card and they just work mostly

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,030
you need to buy one that's not branded

00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,290
as a media center like you know windows

00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,610
the ones rounded Windows Media Center

00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:42,440
don't work as well as the ones that

00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:44,780
aren't just branded you know win PVR you

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,510
you know they have an inbuilt remote

00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,010
that works well with larc your video

00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,690
card choice can matter a little bit

00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:53,210
because some video cards are louder than

00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:56,500
others for instance and some do you know

00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:59,810
a video playback better than others so

00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,550
for instance I originally had a geforce

00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:04,040
card that didn't work very well and then

00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:06,730
i changed to a different nvidia card and

00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,730
that one worked well

00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:14,199
things like if most content nowadays

00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:18,549
seems to come on transport mechanisms

00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:21,660
and requires an external direct TV thing

00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:25,929
the smart card edit comcast cable box

00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:31,079
how does the software command the

00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:31,079
external decoder mhm a change channel

00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:37,299
the short answer is yes but to rephrase

00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:39,099
the question because I get to do that

00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,390
because I'm Speaker I suppose there's

00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:43,029
two really two questions there there's

00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,919
what about devices you know the channels

00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:47,709
that require external decoders like for

00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:49,689
instance Dish TV or high def channels

00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:56,589
that kind of thing and what about I are

00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:58,719
blasting so external link external

00:48:56,589 --> 00:48:59,890
receivers like that are supported often

00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,219
you'll just plug them in with an s-video

00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:05,939
cable or whatever then the problem is

00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:08,919
mostly that control of the external unit

00:49:05,939 --> 00:49:10,419
larc supports I are blasting which is

00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:13,150
you know kind of the approach that we

00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:14,079
used with TiVo's in Australia I are

00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:18,429
blasting is not one hundred percent

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:20,169
reliable if you're reasonably assertive

00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:21,729
with your TV provider you can insist on

00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:23,919
a certain model of set-top boxes and

00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:25,419
some of them have firewire or serial

00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,369
interfaces which are much more reliable

00:49:25,419 --> 00:49:30,279
to control and they're supported as well

00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:32,499
in fact some of the high def set-top

00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:34,959
boxes will just provide you the video on

00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:36,549
fire wire if you ask nicely but that

00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:38,079
depends on your local provider and what

00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:41,469
set-top box they're using and that kind

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,869
of thing ultimately I think it comes

00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:45,279
down to again looking through the list

00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:46,989
of what your options are in your area

00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:49,539
and making a reasonable decision there

00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:52,119
must be one of the reasonably few people

00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:53,559
still on analog cable here because it

00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,630
just works with my whole page card

00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,159
occasionally comcast will ring me up and

00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,739
say you know for two dollars a month

00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:02,169
will give you free channels and a high

00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:04,209
def box and I say well until you have a

00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:07,059
cable card that works in with Linux I'm

00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:08,140
not interested but you know windows

00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:13,089
media center has the same problem

00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:14,949
they've only just released tuner cards

00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:17,229
that can do high-def with the smart card

00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:19,029
encryption II stuff and not all vendors

00:50:17,229 --> 00:50:20,260
work all that reliably it's still kind

00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:22,750
of iterating down to us

00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,250
solution and once that's happened you

00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:31,030
might see better support in Linux as

00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:32,080
well so that like I said that's all the

00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:38,560
slides I have are there any other

00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:40,060
questions yeah so I'm very traditional

00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,570
which is why I picked ext3 it's just

00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:45,130
what I've used for everything any extend

00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,320
space file system should be fine as long

00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:49,210
as it's reliable so I'm not really

00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,970
keeping track of where JFS is up to or

00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,290
anything like that but um you know it

00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,520
should be fine it's just a Linux file

00:50:53,290 --> 00:51:05,860
system right as long as you trust it

00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:08,680
with data you should be okay okay so

00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,060
what about remote file systems they just

00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,100
work it's the short answer if you can

00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,860
mount it in Linux it will work bandwidth

00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,990
can be an issue but then realistically

00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:19,510
encoded video is not that much data per

00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:21,550
minute like I think you know my

00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,170
recordings are generally in the order of

00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:26,020
two gigabytes an hour that's not that

00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:28,030
much data when we were writing the book

00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,500
we started worrying a lot about you know

00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,120
how many tuner cards because could you

00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,190
add before you saturated the desk or how

00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,240
many front ends could you use before you

00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,010
know started worrying about network

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,140
bandwidth and stuff and so we did some

00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:40,120
tests and the reality is you're going to

00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,530
have to try pretty hard I think like if

00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,330
you had a slow wireless network you're

00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,800
going to have a bad day but if you're

00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,660
using like a wired network and you've

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,860
got you know SATA or ide disks or

00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,200
something like that there's something

00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:53,440
that's not you know 15 years old you

00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,750
should be fine yeah so if you go

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,890
something like if you wanted multiple

00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:01,930
capture cards say you've got one that if

00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:04,060
I understand why the comcast works

00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,450
around here you can get a lot of the

00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:08,190
channels just with a normal

00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,480
tuner but there are a whole bunch of

00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,550
other channels that you actually need

00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,410
their decoder for and it does it have

00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:15,060
abstractions for okay I've got two

00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:17,700
tuners but this tuner can only get

00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:19,170
channels 1 through 50 and if you want

00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,089
the other channels you have to use this

00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:23,520
tuner and so right where tysons winners

00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:27,180
in particular channel the really short

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,650
answer is yes the question is hey you

00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,839
know so some channels might only be

00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,339
available on one tuna it's also possible

00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,560
I suppose that one tune is nicer than

00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:36,450
another that kind of thing can you

00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,250
configure all of that the long answer is

00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,520
yes you can set up references you can

00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:43,500
say always record this show on this tuna

00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,390
always use this tuner if it's free this

00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,740
tuna gets this list of channels and this

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,180
tuna gets this different list of

00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,890
channels for instance I've got two

00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,740
tuners and ones an old car they picked

00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:55,260
up cheap off someone I met at work so I

00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,310
prefer to not use that tuner so yeah you

00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,599
could you can define all these

00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:59,599
preferences around that kind of stuff

00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:09,750
yeah she was Lois G for a series that

00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:11,250
offers a full acceleration ok so the

00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,329
question is a really specific question

00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,530
about video cards that I can't answer

00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:19,650
off the top of my head I'd have to look

00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:23,490
it up to be honest I don't know if any

00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:25,680
idea what you just said Leslie ok so if

00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:27,569
you know if you play back HD or recorded

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,910
like a full HD stream is like two

00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:32,869
megabytes a second so if you have a nest

00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,869
box which is like

00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,940
yeah so the comment was that a full HD

00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,950
screen was what to make a second you

00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:46,550
said yeah like I said I don't get any HD

00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:48,740
because I'm pigheaded yes a comcast

00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:50,390
offered me a free you know HD thingy i

00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:56,570
plug in and it's horrible it's really

00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:58,540
really horrible okay okay cool

00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:01,190
advertising by this government you know

00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,960
they're mandated so they have to have it

00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:05,240
it's just it on advertised because you

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,830
want to sell you something yeah so the

00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,570
other thing is comcast rang me up at one

00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:10,130
point and offered me for literally zero

00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,620
dollars a month but there was a price on

00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,480
it was just 0 this little external box

00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,990
that I'm pretty sure is doing video over

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,480
IP and it's using the you know the data

00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:22,340
back channel that's on the the analog

00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,900
cable to download video but it's

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,520
horrible like it's you know all those

00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,540
MPEG compression artifacts where it goes

00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,280
blocky and stuff it's like that the

00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:34,400
whole time so I used it for about a week

00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:37,240
and then I turned it off so bc dealer

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,240
basic it over like

00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:43,910
channels ok cool so you know the

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,410
yeah you know HD piece you know you know

00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:47,869
there's like this one another supported

00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,940
card you can plug in your PC no self to

00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:52,040
recording Mississippi you know inputs

00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:54,560
like a regular analog and the HD

00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,320
channels okay cool and they've also a

00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,300
version where oficio gift to HD tuners

00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,890
in a and an ethernet interface so you

00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,570
can just see how basically you know

00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:05,150
whoever can connect to the network and

00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:08,630
you know recording yeah exactly that HD

00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:10,040
homerun oh the hdhomerun is cool sorry

00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,930
so the gentleman's mentioning the

00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,760
hdhomerun it's also interesting because

00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:17,119
it's a tuner that doesn't have to plug

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,220
into the pc so you can get these devices

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,810
that you plug into your you know cable

00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,369
thing or antenna or whatever you got and

00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,710
you plug it into the network and you

00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:26,119
stick it under a couch and then the myth

00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,710
box goes and get to the video over the

00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,630
network so that's another way of solving

00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:31,369
that you know my cable provider put the

00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,570
you know socket in this horrible place I

00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,730
don't want to put a computer that kind

00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:36,470
of thing I think we should call it a

00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:40,390
night if you've got any other questions

00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,350
feel free to come up and have a chat and

00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,790
Leslie wants you to come up and read the

00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:49,730
back of my t-shirt I think I think

00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:51,440
pretty sure that's what that said oh ok

00:55:49,730 --> 00:56:04,820
yet so this is the t-shirt that Leslie

00:55:51,440 --> 00:56:06,320
gave me it's lovely I actually have

00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,790
written a couple but that's okay I've

00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,260
also because i didn't want to shield the

00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,609
book i know i mentioned a couple of

00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,560
times but that was just my excuse for

00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:15,680
learning about myth i also have the

00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:18,130
competing book so whatever all right you

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,130
