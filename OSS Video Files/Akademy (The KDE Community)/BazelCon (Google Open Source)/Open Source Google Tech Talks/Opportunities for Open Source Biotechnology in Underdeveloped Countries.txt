ABSTRACT

Guido D. Nez-Mujica will be presenting on Science, Innovation and entrepreneurship in developing countries, specifically in Venezuela, where he is from. He decided to stay there, instead of going abroad, to do some cheap biotechnology that is useful to people, solves unmet needs and allows us to use our knowledge for more than academic purposes.

The conditions there are very different from the conditions in developed countries. In terms of politics, as well as due to logistic and legal issues, some of those differences are drawbacks, while others can be treated as advantages. He believes that open source models could thrive in underdeveloped countries such as Venezuela and create successful examples of private initiative in places where the public sector runs almost everything. The presentation is less of a detailed analysis, and more of a personal perspective and account of the experiences in his lab with a current project: A kit for Chagas disease diagnostic, plus an overview of the general situation and the opportunities it offers.
