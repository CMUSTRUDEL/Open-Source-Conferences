ABSTRACT

The Linux Kernel, who is developing it, how they are doing it,
 and why you should care.

 This talk describes the rate of development for the Linux
 kernel, and how the development model is set up to handle such a
 large and diverse developer population and huge rate of change.
 It will detail who is doing the work, and what companies, if
 any, are sponsering it. Finally, it will go into why companies
 like Google, and any other that uses or depends on Linux, should
 care about this development. Lots of numbers and pretty graphs
 will be shown to keep the audience awake.
