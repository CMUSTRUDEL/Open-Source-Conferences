ABSTRACT

Lessons from Advogato

Advogato is a community blog for free software developers, founded in 1999 as a testbed for ideas on attack-resistant trust metrics. The site now has 13k registered users, of whom over 3000 are ranked with one of the "Apprentice", "Journeyer", or "Master" certifications. Though I neglected the maintenance of the site for many years, it has retained an active community, and is seeing significant new life since it was handed over to the new maintainer, Steven Rainwater.

By the exponential-growth standards of the dot-com boom, Advogato has been only a modest success. Yet, the experience of the site over the years contains a number...

good evening ladies and gentlemen and

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,290
welcome to the open source developers at

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,420
Google speaker series it is my pleasure

00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,950
this evening to introduce Raph Levien

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,680
who will be talking to us about lessons

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,680
for mod we got him ruff thank you thank

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,660
you so kindly I am now at Google

00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:47,340
incorporated I have been here about a

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,070
month so I guess I should have brought

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,610
my little propeller hat thing which is a

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:59,040
sign that I'm a new blur I did advogado

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,989
about eight years ago in 1999 and so I'm

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,080
going to do something of a post-mortem

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,320
in this talk I'm going to talk about

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,030
what advogado is what it was about you

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,100
know some of the goals how well it met

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,700
some of those goals in some ways it

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,750
didn't do as well as I had hoped and you

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,430
know as I go through what advogado is

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,630
I'm going to talk about some of the

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,520
lessons that I've learned some of the

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,940
kind of take home things that hopefully

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,010
you can apply to other systems that do

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,200
this kind of trust and reputation and

00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,580
these slides are going to be online

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,770
there's also video I'm hoping some

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,170
people will be watching so there's lots

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,420
of notes in the online version that you

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:49,470
can refer to later um so what what is

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,950
advogado it really was motivated as a

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,229
platform for testing out ideas on trust

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,259
metrics or kind of distributed

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,479
reputation the original motivation in

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,549
fact wasn't to build a blog type

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,400
community website system at all it was

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,850
to build a better DNS it turned out that

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,000
was a pretty hard problem and I kind of

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,850
got distracted by just the sub issue of

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,380
if you've got like a lot of users that

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,420
are out there on the internet and you

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,400
don't really know who they are how can

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,650
you how can you define you know the

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,370
edges of who belongs to the community

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,560
and who doesn't so I built the site

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,989
around I guess the first launch of it

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,329
was in November of 1999 I done some

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,090
theoretical work before then and needed

00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:38,940
to test it out on real users and what

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,980
what the actual site is is pretty

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,330
blogs and articles kind of a clone of

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,950
slashdot in some ways one of the things

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,840
that made a very different than slashdot

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,690
is that you have this social network

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,000
graph which is constructed with explicit

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,910
you I interaction so when you go to the

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,890
site then you when you click on somebody

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,290
else's profile you get to certify them

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,690
to say how much of a free software

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,600
developer are they these days it has

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,450
about 13,000 users sort of a modest

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,580
success and as I said it was it was

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,470
really designed as a testbed for the

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,270
trust metric ideas so the whole

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,210
motivation for building the site was

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,390
this concept that I was exploring back

00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,030
in the late 90s of what I call attack

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,490
resistant trust metrics and they're

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,330
really two aspects of that as the name

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,010
would suggest you've gotta trust metric

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,090
which is about using the social network

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,000
information to compute some information

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,760
some score of whether a person is

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,660
trustworthy in some sense and the thing

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,120
that makes it I think unique compared

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,150
with other systems in the same basic

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,670
genre is the attack resistance that you

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,950
want to build a system that you can't

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,160
just sign up and create a gazillion

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,830
phony accounts and have those phony

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,220
accounts influence the result of this

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,110
trust metric computation very much so

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,350
you want to put some kind of bound on

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,269
what a spammer can do Microsoft had a

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,040
paper basically saying with different

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,859
assumptions you can't do this that's the

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,169
civil paper but it depends on what your

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,490
assumptions are there aren't that many

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,980
systems out there that are attack

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,870
resistor I mean if you just add up votes

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,240
or something you know simple like that

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,530
then it's not it's not attack resistant

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,710
at all one of the things that's not

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,930
exactly the same as advogado in terms of

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,960
the goals the scope but does have this

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,000
attack resistance property is the

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,979
PageRank algorithm that Google's you

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,860
know used since the beginning to rank

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,409
web pages and that's worked out pretty

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,599
well and

00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:56,909
it's actually again one of the

00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,159
surprising things of you know why why

00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,869
are people not more interested in this I

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,729
mean here you have an example a research

00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:05,639
project that's modestly successful you

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,889
have a commercial implementation of a

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,800
similar concept that's at least modestly

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:13,879
successful I think Google's most people

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,959
with degrees there's pretty good system

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:21,509
and attack resistance maybe sounds more

00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,629
exciting than it is you know that that

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,699
it makes it sound like it's this

00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:30,569
fortress this this wall that cannot be

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:33,149
scaled no matter how you know how how

00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,189
strongly you want to scale it and it's

00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,769
possible that the kind of the name has

00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:41,039
brought on some unrealistic expectations

00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:45,449
and in fact i'm going to show kind of

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,479
the lesson slides in green here one of

00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,309
the problems is that trust metric is a

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,839
poor name i mean you say trust metric

00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:56,300
and you know i really have some very

00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:59,459
technical meanings that are behind it

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,289
trust is a very fuzzy concept when you

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:06,360
say trust in ordinary English you know

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:09,349
meaning yeah you know conversation it

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,479
can mean in 5-10 different things so

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:15,749
when I took on the word I was really

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,699
using the existing literature PGP tried

00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:19,829
to create this thing again with the sort

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,139
of original goals of building a better

00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:26,989
dns try to build this thing called the

00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:29,219
web of trust and that was really only

00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:32,039
modestly successful but it certainly

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:33,929
brought this idea of trust as something

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,119
that can be computed you know into

00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:38,659
people's mind and there were also a

00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:41,219
couple of important academic

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:44,819
publications that we're also using this

00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:47,189
word of trust to talk about you know

00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,229
some quantity that could be computed so

00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,269
you had the really one of the first

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,039
papers that kicked this this line of

00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,689
research off the valuation of trust and

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,319
open networks by bet borcherding and

00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:59,909
climb back in 94 turned out that trust

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,159
metric was completely broken and not

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:05,960
attack resistant at all but it

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:08,090
kick-started the the field I think

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,220
and then you had Matt blazes work on

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,190
policy maker and a couple of other

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,770
related systems that he put under the

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,360
rubric of trust management no he pointed

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,220
out you know that he was pitching these

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,470
ideas to a lot of financial you know

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,729
types of applications and he'd give this

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,560
talk he'd give a talk on trust

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,509
management at a bank and everybody would

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,729
say but I thought this was supposed to

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:32,960
be about administration of trust funds

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,430
you know but these days you can these

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,380
days if you do a Google search on trust

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,389
management you you find a couple of

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,660
those but mostly things on on the

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,940
computational concept of trust and you

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,729
know as I said I mean what what are you

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,340
actually measuring I mean a few examples

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,889
you might trust a user to not spam you

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,259
might feel that their blog is worth

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,360
reading you might trust them with more

00:07:54,259 --> 00:08:00,110
things like your wallet or your car keys

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,580
or something like that advogado you know

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,289
just to kind of define the scope of this

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,539
that what actually got implemented

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:08,419
really deals with exactly the first two

00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,610
questions on this list do you think the

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,110
person's a spammer and even if they're

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,630
not a spammer even if they're a real

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,120
person do you really want to spend your

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,560
time reading their blog and I really

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,469
didn't get into the financial stuff at

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,090
all the word metric is also something

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:29,630
with very specific technical meanings

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,000
and you know like the exists the the

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,890
original work on this was a lot of it

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,539
about monotonicity that if you add more

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,029
certificates that you only increased

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,500
trust and that's that monotonicity is

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,810
something that you find in metric spaces

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,700
and so on and so forth and again that

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,010
the term was really borrowed from the

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,110
academic literature writer and

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,000
Stubblebine did a pretty good work on

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,300
trust metric called metrics of

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,910
authentication these days you wouldn't

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,720
really call it this authentication

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,120
authentication is more about you know

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,690
what open ID does does this user

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,250
correspond there to their credentials so

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,410
they're actually when you go a little

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,610
deeper into the skin and avocado one of

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,779
the things is that there are two

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,190
different trust metrics that got

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,240
implemented and it's kind of important

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,120
to understand the difference between

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,610
these two and I will be going into a lot

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,880
more detail about that so the original

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,040
one

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,140
is based on network flow as the

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:30,230
underlying mathematics and it has the

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:32,030
this very visible you I display that

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,980
every user gets ranked as either

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,590
apprentice journey or master or perhaps

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,510
no certification whatsoever and then

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,070
there's another one that's a little bit

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,930
more subtle that you don't even see it

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,550
unless you're logged in that's based on

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,440
eigenvectors which is the same kind of

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,350
underlying technology that page rank and

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,880
clever use and that computes something

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,090
different that computes this how

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,290
interesting is this blog measure so

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,330
they're both attack resistant they have

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,010
some characteristics in common including

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,410
the attack resistance some things

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,480
different based on the underlying math

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,940
now one of the big differences is that

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,140
the original one only does positive

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,370
information I believe this person is a

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,840
free software developer that's the

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,060
community that I'm defining in the

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,730
original trust metric there is no way to

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,930
say this person is not for their a

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,600
spammer or what they write is

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,970
uninteresting and in the second

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:29,060
eigenvector base trust metric that does

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:33,380
exist this question so eigen vector is a

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:36,320
very fancy mathematical term that really

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,060
talks about if you have a matrix that

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,100
represents some kind of system like

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,140
traversing webpages that it really

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,590
speaks to that system reaching a steady

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,200
state so it's it's it's talking about

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,760
the underlying mathematics so I'm not

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,920
going to go into the details there's

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,260
there are more details in the papers but

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,000
kind of the takeaway thing is that there

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,430
is a class of these things that's really

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,170
been motivated by a web search like the

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,330
PageRank that Google uses like the

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,430
clever algorithm out of out of IBM

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,670
they're all based on this eigenvector

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,170
underlying mathematics and really that's

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,630
what I'm saying that that the second

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,810
trust metric is is sharing some of that

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,790
mathematical underpinnings I actually

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,070
did do an experiment where I tried to do

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,610
a negative reputation system in avocado

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,230
and it was an unmitigated disaster III

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,060
called the reading in addition to these

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,010
three i called it dimwit and it it

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,070
turned out that there were a lot of hurt

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,310
feelings

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,980
and you know it just didn't it just

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,560
didn't meet its goals but later on it

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,820
really became clear that you needed some

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,080
some negative reputation so this gives

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,580
you a little bit of an idea I didn't

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,790
make this figure this is actually out of

00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:53,610
a PhD thesis worth reading by a guy

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,700
named I Chi Nicholas Ziegler I believe

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,020
is his name and he actually did his own

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,750
trust metric that was sort of a

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,210
follow-on to this work and kind of

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,620
compares the two but you know just to

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,150
give you a little bit of an idea that

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,850
there's there's some pretty complex

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,400
sophisticated math under it but I won't

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,990
go into too much detail on that instead

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm going to try and introduce these

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,910
concepts by telling a story and this is

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,070
what you're seeing here is actually the

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,020
original motivating story behind this

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,030
trust metric and this story happened

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,510
first and then the site kind of got

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,310
built second so let's say that it's the

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,960
middle of the Linux revolution Linux is

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,300
going to take over the world and you're

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,010
a book publisher and you got a very

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,020
specific problem that you've got this

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,600
book that every free software developer

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,920
should have and you also want to sell a

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,020
lot of copies so you don't want to give

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,100
it away to everybody in the world so you

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,730
just want to give it to the people who

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,950
are free software developers and you you

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,930
want to draw this line of who is a

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,660
member of this community fairly

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,300
accurately you can't do it by manual

00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,190
review you can't have a you know you

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,930
know some person whose job it is to go

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,670
out there and find all of the people in

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,520
the free software community or something

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,260
that would be too expensive and there's

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,950
always people i mean the free software

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,320
world is so diverse so impossible to

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,200
really put your finger on that you're

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,820
always going to miss some people in this

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,710
story under these assumptions and

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,990
getting the assumptions right is really

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,760
important we're going to be okay with

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,830
being a little too generous we might say

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,150
you know what it's totally fine if ten

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,860
percent of the people who sign up for

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,120
this it could be a book it could be a

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,160
little bit of free money could be

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,010
conference pass whatever we're going to

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,160
say as long as it's a bounded as long as

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,900
it's a relatively small fraction of what

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,370
we're doing that we're going to be okay

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,760
with that we're just going to say that's

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,380
going to cost less then

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,960
you know however much it would cost to

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,030
get this information exactly per perfect

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,950
but on the other hand we're going to

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,660
really try not to exclude people because

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,420
if we do then they're going to write

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,910
extremely angry blog postings about how

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,470
the book publisher is not really as open

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,880
inclusive and so on and so forth is

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:07,010
they'd like to be so let's say for the

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,810
sake of the next few slides that these

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,130
are your assumptions now I'm basically

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,150
going to tell you how you can solve this

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:16,580
problem so the first step is that you

00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,990
get a social network built so really you

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,460
you you go out there to the free

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,200
software developers and you convince

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:25,250
them all to sign up for accounts and put

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,410
in their social network data of

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,590
essentially an arrow says I know this

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,210
person and I trust them and step 2 I'm

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:38,300
not so sure about step 3 is of course

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:40,070
profit so because we're giving away free

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,350
ebooks or free money or whatever it is I

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,720
mean that's that's an assumption that we

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,160
can make that we're also going to make

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,320
the assumption that there's going to be

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,770
an attacker out there that is trying to

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,820
break the system and the theoretical

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:57,340
work behind this really is based on sort

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,110
of over the space of all possible

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,360
attacks how can you make a system that

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,640
will still you know resist these kind of

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,600
attacks still not give away you know a

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,390
million books or whatever while I was

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,100
making the slide you can't like draw a

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,110
picture of all possible attacks that's

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,090
just too complicated to think about to

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,070
reason about so one of the things that I

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,320
found you know in the in the research

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,540
phase of this is that the attacks that

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,940
work the attacks that are really

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,040
difficult to protect yourself against

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,290
are the ones in which you take the

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,180
existing data that's good and you copy

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:36,410
it you make your own shadow copy of it

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:39,160
and and then you know you basically put

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,600
that into the system now surprisingly

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,210
spammers have kind of learned that trick

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,840
and so it's quite common if you look at

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,870
spam this or that that you'll often see

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,920
bits of copy text bits of copied link

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,850
structure and so as the example that

00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,050
we're going to work through again

00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,970
a high level I'm not going to go into

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:03,600
the detailed map but just to give you

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,759
the flavor of where this attack

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,620
resistance property comes from we'll

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,560
just use this example where I've taken

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,170
the graph of mate copy and then I've

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,380
relied on a small number of gullible

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,449
users who we will somehow trick into

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,579
creating an edge saying that they trust

00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:23,360
one of these copy notes if you don't

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:29,220
have any gullible users then you're fine

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:33,029
also you know the Easter Bunny and Santa

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,920
Claus and all that so what are some of

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,389
the metrics that we can compute I mean

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,540
there's lots of metric so metric is

00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:42,240
anything that you measure basically so

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,370
you've got a lot of metrics that you

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,410
could easily calculate over this thing

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,029
and and and some of which people have

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,279
you know done some work to try and

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,230
actually do so you could count edges you

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,639
could say ah this person must be really

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,889
trusted because they have three edges

00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,899
coming in they must be a very highly

00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,089
respected member of the community the

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,279
problem is this guy also has three three

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,400
edges coming in there's no way that you

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,679
can look at cat excuse me counting the

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,569
number of edges or any kind of local

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,039
statistic that you can compute on the

00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,720
graph because if you have a local

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,419
statistic that you're competing on the

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,730
graph then the copy the Shadow Copy

00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,319
attack is going to look exactly like the

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,780
real thing there's no way to tell the

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,990
difference another thing you can do

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,970
that's a little different that's global

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,890
is reach ability are we reachable from

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,140
the seed well in this particular case

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,549
not so great because you know maybe I

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,240
didn't draw all the arrows the right

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,460
direction but you know in general once

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,049
you get one gullible user then then the

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:49,559
whole thing is is considered reachable

00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:51,419
now when I say kills you I actually mean

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,210
something very specific like that what

00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,789
I'm talking about is the relationship

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,799
between the cost of the attack so I'm

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,960
saying in order to get a gullible user

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,909
to create an edge from the bad user to

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,390
the good user is something that has a

00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:08,220
certain cost to it and if I kill you I

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,660
mean that you do a certain amount of

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,210
work with a certain amount of cost

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,550
and then you fall off the cliff in terms

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,920
of how much damage that you can create

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,840
that that you can create you can go in

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,700
and sign in with your millions BAM notes

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,460
and you can get your million free books

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,800
given away so a better metric and one

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,020
that you see for example all the time in

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,880
social networking systems today is this

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,350
concept of distance from the seed how

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,450
many steps do I have to walk down this

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,220
graph and again if you go back to the

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,380
example that you see we're going to do

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,390
pretty well that is a matter of fact if

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,310
you if you only do things that are the

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,380
seed one step away from the seed or two

00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,960
steps of the way from the seed that will

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,410
avoid getting the bad you know node all

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,980
together will also exclude this guy too

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:58,590
bad and then if we you know take that

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,780
reach ability out one step further so

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,670
that it's you know three degrees instead

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,040
of just the two then in fact we'll get

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,200
everybody but we won't and we'll also

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,450
get this guy the problem is then with

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,010
this reach ability Stella metric matchup

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,470
not reach ability sorry that the

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,890
distance away from the seed metric that

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,040
you can then clone that one node and get

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:23,460
unbounded number of nodes accepted so in

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,950
the story of the original assumptions of

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,980
giving away free books that's not good

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,320
so all you need is a gullible user that

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,290
is near the seed and you have the same

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,630
falling off the cliff behavior we're a

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,090
relatively small amount of cost in the

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,850
attack creating a millions BAM nodes is

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,410
not considered costly having that edge

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:49,980
from the gullible user is the part

00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:54,390
that's costly so the answer not

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:56,520
surprisingly is network flow so this is

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,260
the same graph as last time it sorted to

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,260
be a little bit easier to figure out

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,840
what's going on perhaps especially if

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,520
you're colorblind I kind of considered

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,830
making that graph in black and white

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,850
first and then making it in color but I

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,930
didn't want to be too mean so again I'm

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,360
not going to go into the math here it's

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,550
very complicated which is one of the

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,660
reasons I guess why so few people have

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:23,460
adopted this but the the inspiration

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,919
here is really the sort of

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,620
mene mene cotton max-flow theorem out of

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,570
network flow theory which which says

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,640
that you know that that if you compute

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,580
the maximum flow over some network that

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,890
the the quantity of that flow is equal

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,809
to the to the minimal cut across the

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,490
network so you're really making the

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:44,760
assumption that you can tag this network

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,350
and cut it across a fairly small number

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,809
of edges from your good notes to your

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,419
bad notes and then you can you can

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:53,970
actually prove very tight bound on the

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,450
number of bad knows that your trust

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,710
metric is going to accept that it is

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:03,390
bounded by the amount of flow across

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:06,179
that note so a the amount of flow across

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,429
the edge from the gullible user to the

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,590
bad users so as long as you can keep

00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,149
that bounded as long as you can you know

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,970
keep the number of gullible users

00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:16,740
certifying bad users low you can

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,490
actually succeed and make this thing

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,890
attack resistant in the sense that you

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:27,330
can't just get your million free books

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,710
given away so I took this idea and I

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,510
implemented it for something that wasn't

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,520
at all in the same set of assumptions

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,380
you know it's avocado is not a book

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,320
publisher that is trying to give away a

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:40,070
lot of free books it's this kind of

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,330
slashdot like community blog site with

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,850
articles and blogs and so on and so

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:48,120
forth so what the actual implementation

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,679
does is that it runs this trust metric

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,799
that I just described with a network

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,200
slow and it uses the results as access

00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:00,029
control if you get accepted by the by

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,039
the by the trust metric then you can

00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:04,679
post articles and you get you know other

00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,299
other you can edit anybody's project

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,020
descriptions so it has kind of like a

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:14,789
wiki like functionality within within

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:17,010
this so there are a couple of problems i

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,080
mean the the assumptions now are not

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,409
quite matching what does what the

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,730
architecture the site does that you know

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,409
once you get a bad note once you get

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,320
accepted you can post an unbounded

00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:31,320
number of articles and another problem

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,690
is well i have this this thing where you

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,940
can create a new account and even

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,740
without being certified you can do lots

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,220
and lots of span

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,370
we'll get back to these so the take-home

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,840
lesson from this story is that you have

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:50,480
to apply them correctly your assumptions

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:54,110
need to match what the actual use of

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,150
that trust metric is so ideally you've

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,830
got I mean when I started this the the

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,530
space of trust metrics known was pretty

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,809
small and you know that I was kind of

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,309
blazing new trails in terms of coming up

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,820
with ones that were attack resistant and

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:09,290
I proofs of that these days you've got

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,450
more work on it hopefully you have this

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,470
big giant tool kit this bag of trust

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,940
metrics and you can say they're

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,160
different ones with different trade-offs

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,679
and different amounts of being

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,760
probabilistic or whatever you can just

00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,679
pick the one that matches your

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,309
assumptions if you can do that then your

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,590
chance of of successes is much better

00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:29,120
you have to be thinking of like you know

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,179
I gave that story about the relative

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,740
cost of not giving a book to somebody

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:36,230
who thought they deserve one versus

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,730
giving too many way depending on the you

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,860
know the cost of false positives and

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,540
false negatives you know totally depends

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,080
on the application and it's not you know

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,970
just some mathematical thing giving yes

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,910
or no access control you know basically

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,860
saying mod + w you know when somebody

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,370
gets access it's a bad thing what you

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,740
really want to do if you can is have the

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,860
trust metric somehow correlated with the

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,990
amount of damage that a person can do so

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,390
you want to make it so that there is no

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,340
falling off of a cliff behavior that if

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,200
a person wants to post spam they have to

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,610
do a lot more you know if they want to

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,080
post a million messages they have to do

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,470
a lot more in terms of creating that

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,410
attack than if they just did one another

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,880
problem that I ran into is that

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,230
especially when you get people that are

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,100
explicitly putting in their social

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:27,410
network information people don't read

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,020
the people don't read the instructions a

00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,780
lot of people are reluctant they don't

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,059
want to make many notes at all so you

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,160
actually get a fairly noisy graph you

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:39,800
can't make the assumption that this

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,110
graph is going to be a high quality

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:46,070
piece of data so you have to be aware of

00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:49,210
that and I think you know these days

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:52,390
there's kind of recognition in this fact

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,000
so avocado is a dramatic success the

00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,370
reviews are in bugs in advogado the

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,289
trust metric systems seems to be chock

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:08,140
full of bugs lately as a matter of fact

00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:11,679
that is the top story on the site and it

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,720
happens fairly frequently how much we

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,360
trust the judgment of this might have

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:22,029
might be you know you might take into

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:25,240
account how well they can spell but in

00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:28,330
fact there are a lot of comments that

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,210
came in you know does everyone not agree

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,710
that the trust metric is compromised

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:35,980
it's completely vulnerable to spamming

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:39,460
the system seems to be broken so one of

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,840
the take-home lessons here is that I

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,789
didn't do a very good job of

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,039
communicating what the trust metric was

00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:47,710
about what the avocado site was about of

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,360
you know the expectation a lot of when

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,039
you read these complaints a lot of them

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,890
basically are that they don't really

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,809
understand you know what this marvelous

00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:00,070
attack resistant trust metric is

00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:01,840
supposed to do and you know another

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,090
consequence of that is that you know

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,190
people people don't just immediately say

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,440
oh I want to deploy that on my site

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,419
because you know and if they ask me for

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,610
advice you know I won't say oh yeah just

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:15,820
plug it in and go because you have to do

00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,220
this kind of complex matching of what

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,289
the trust metric actually does with the

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,419
assumptions of the site a matching that

00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:25,299
I didn't at least in the early days do

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,620
very well in advogado itself and another

00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,080
thing that I think really heard is that

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,039
I didn't do as much academic publication

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,600
on these ideas as I should have because

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:41,110
people really do look look to that

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:42,640
literature so hardly in response to the

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,010
shortcomings of the first trust metric

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,940
of advogado I built a second trust

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:51,429
metric and at heart this is actually a

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,950
very generic metadata engine that you

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:57,820
can use to do music reviews and so on

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,139
and so forth and I wrote how to and you

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,850
know I said you know I've been thinking

00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:02,320
about this more you know I know what the

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,850
limitations of advogado are

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,309
I know the problems you need something

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,289
that can do these negative ratings you

00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,919
know somebody's blog is not interesting

00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:13,570
worth reading you know here's here's my

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,370
here's my intellectual property you know

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,620
go forth and implement it and by the way

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,019
it's based on eigenvector so it's

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,610
similar technologies PageRank different

00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:24,429
enough it probably doesn't violate the

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,409
patent that's not my official legal

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:28,059
decision that's just what I said in my

00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:33,130
paper that I wrote before I started

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:34,570
working at Google and I got almost no

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,450
interest to almost no take up on the

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:42,690
idea so I said well I have to go and

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:44,980
implement it myself so this thing

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,629
another it has a lot of interesting

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,490
features it computes both the value and

00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:50,289
a confidence and another interesting

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,029
feature that differs from the original

00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:54,340
one is that it's a local view that if

00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,799
you rank somebody's blog is really

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,450
interesting and somebody else says that

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,629
blog is very uninteresting well you each

00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,370
get the the benefit of your own view of

00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:06,549
that and in fact the people in the sort

00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:09,519
of clouds around you yet their their

00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:12,070
their values of this weighted based on

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:16,330
sort of closeness in the social network

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:18,370
so this thing works and in this

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,809
particular case the the assumptions you

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,200
know really match reality very closely

00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:25,690
that what you were what you were putting

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,610
into the metadata ranking system was how

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,289
interesting is this blog and what was

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,480
coming out was a rating of how

00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,100
interesting is this blog so I'll go to

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:39,879
the demo now we'll go into a little bit

00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:42,549
more detail will test this and see you

00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:51,639
know what I'm not logged in so we'll do

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:54,490
that and okay one consequence of this is

00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:56,230
that or one specific feature of the

00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,259
implementation is that you really only

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:03,639
see these rating values when you're

00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:05,919
logged in so here's one it's a one to

00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:09,250
ten scale and just looking looking at it

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,159
you know at the top that here's one that

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,419
has a value 3.7 and we see that he's

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,919
writing about stuff that doesn't have a

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,820
lot to do with free software he's not a

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,610
spammer and

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,420
Thank but he's certainly not writing

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:25,150
about free software a lot and as you as

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:28,140
you go through this you know I encourage

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:32,230
everybody to to to look for themselves

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,510
but you'll see unfortunately this this

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,480
gray is kind of it's very hard it's

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:40,750
impossible to read yeah apologies for

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:48,630
that it that actually am trying to do

00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:59,350
that control a what doesn't do this yeah

00:29:48,630 --> 00:30:00,790
yeah so this is yeah yeah you know this

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,830
is actually supposed to be a feature

00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,290
rather than a bug that it displays the

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:10,330
the really low confidence values you

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:13,330
know in very faded language it is chock

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,520
full of books quite rang I should have

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:21,160
done the demo on a blackboard obviously

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,020
is so I I should probably I kind of

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,850
jumped into this a little bit into the

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,430
second trust metric a little bit too

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,520
quickly that the color coding reflects

00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:33,460
the rating of the user by the first

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,410
trust metric so purple is a master level

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,260
blue as journeyer level and green is

00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,320
apprentice level and then if you see

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,030
gray then that's no certification at all

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,490
and in fact people when those

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:51,820
certification can still post on the

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:54,370
recent Diaries list and you don't see

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,170
very much of that most of the most of

00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,430
the users are people who certainly the

00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:02,110
frequent posters are people who have

00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:04,900
certifications so in in my experience

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,490
the the people who get high values like

00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,930
there's a threshold value here that's

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,240
said at three sort of anybody under

00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:14,730
three is probably a spammer or you know

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,730
not not doing what they ought to do

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:23,300
no it's just sorted by day so there's a

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,980
lot of features that are not actually

00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,010
implemented in the site I have to do a

00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,320
lot with you know my bandwidth for

00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,850
implementing this stuff and those are

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,100
all things that are marvelous and the

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,720
code is out there and you're more than

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,800
welcome to implement that but it's not

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,830
done it this is not I'm not I'm not

00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,380
really you know advertising that the

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,270
site itself is worth emulating I'm

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,680
trying to get the point across that it's

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:53,350
about the trust metrics that are in it

00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:57,170
and I filtered it here with a very high

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:59,360
threshold of 9 and you'll find I think

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,250
when you look at it that mostly now

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,290
you're looking at blog posts that have

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:08,120
to do with the the programming and

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:10,970
generally people that are pretty highly

00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,700
regarded in the community robo gato is

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,040
the new maintainer of the site you see

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:19,340
you have less sites but it's perhaps a

00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,920
worthwhile way to to read the site and

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,380
again I encourage so of the ones that

00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,810
you saw it suppressed 87 entries as

00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,030
being below the threshold and then if we

00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,160
look at him without the threshold then

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,050
you'll probably see someone's a very low

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,820
you know if you look at the ones that

00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:40,310
are sort of below three you know like

00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,750
this one is not an English it maybe he's

00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,070
a free software developer but he just

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:47,150
hasn't convinced the rest of the

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:51,410
community of that fact and this guy

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:53,320
again 1.6 and again i have no idea i can

00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:57,550
click on him and see what he's about but

00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,390
he hasn't he just mostly click you know

00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,970
clicks links he doesn't talk about

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,470
programming so that's a case where if

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,910
you have your threshold set above that

00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,910
then you're not going to see him at all

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:13,690
so I kind of gave a little demo that

00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:16,550
this this second trust metric uses a

00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,900
creates a filtered view and I probably

00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,250
should have been more aggressive in

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,870
implementing this thing that you

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,420
actually have to be logged in because it

00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,160
has this local you know everybody has

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,650
their own seed you see your own view of

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,620
the universe there isn't a global

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,380
concept

00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,390
as in the first trust metric and you

00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,600
know the hardcore uses of the site get a

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,280
lot out of this the people who are not

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,100
you know casual users and they're

00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,930
they're really just as important don't

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,530
get the don't get the benefit of this

00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:48,090
trust metric so again how the details of

00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:52,260
the implant of the implementation really

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:55,200
matter so a couple of years ago new

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,780
problems started coming up and this is

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,230
very common problem you see this you see

00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:03,270
this all of the time insights now that

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,740
when I when I first built the site I

00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,750
really wanted to be open i wanted

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,100
everybody who was a real free software

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,620
developer to be able to sign up create

00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,720
an account get noticed from the writing

00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,790
of their Diaries their blogs get the

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,240
certifications have a low barrier to

00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:20,340
entry so i made it very open that you

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,030
can sign up and create an account and

00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:27,000
post without needing any of this trust

00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,770
metric sophisticated stuff at all and i

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,780
kind of knew that that was you know that

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,540
that was a problem that that was that

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,360
the thing was to open and you know I

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,159
always had the intent of closing that up

00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,340
as soon as it started getting abused and

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,310
in fact in the early days because it

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,950
wasn't getting abused then that kind of

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,470
brought up this really strange question

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:51,570
of you know is does this attack

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,639
resistant trust metric really work at

00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:57,780
all or are people just not attacking the

00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:01,170
site so thankfully finally people came

00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:03,000
along and started testing this so these

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,560
days you don't even have to ask that

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,260
question that if you have anything

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,790
that's worth anything then it will it

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,250
will attract the spammers and the

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,550
attackers and the abusers but in the

00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:18,900
early days it wasn't quite so clear so

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:20,850
you know the motivations behind the

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,560
original design were to create openness

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,200
because a lot of people thought that

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,300
even having a yes no decision was too

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,940
elitist that it didn't match the fos of

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,940
the free software community so that

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,310
that's what motivated the design and

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,070
it's now fixed in fact I didn't do this

00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,840
I handed it over the site about a year

00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,859
ago to Stephen rainwater who's the

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,910
current overlord

00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:47,200
hi Steven if you're watching a video and

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,829
he what he did is that he basically

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:55,710
added a flag this account as spam so

00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:59,410
maybe I can do an online demo of this

00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:11,049
that we go into NYADA got our members of

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:21,220
whom yeah okay suggestion from the

00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:25,539
audience of okay mi ke el excellent

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:30,970
cheap viagra online links so did you um

00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:35,619
well I thought you I see how long is

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:38,230
this oh my gosh yeah it's a popular name

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:44,470
so I don't know why this person is still

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:45,940
in the system but they flagged no

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,230
accounts so so one of the things that

00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,329
you can see here is that he has this

00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,160
link but he hasn't been doing posting if

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:52,960
he were to post new Diaries if he were

00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,119
to post Diaries then his account would

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,170
come to people's attention and then it

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,859
would get a flagged as spam not often

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,690
enough apparently so I just clicked on

00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:07,749
the flag this is spam and I increased

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,400
the score from three to six and I got to

00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:12,039
do that because I'm certified as master

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,789
the actual amount of bump that I do to

00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:18,730
this BAM rating depends on the level of

00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:21,220
certification and so if they go if

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,989
another couple of people do this three

00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,849
or four maybe then it'll bump the score

00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:30,930
to 15 and then their account will be

00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:30,930
automatically deleted and maybe I can

00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:39,999
big party well he was he was one of the

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:42,160
one of the original you know wave of

00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:44,619
spammers so we'll look at these people

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,720
it's fairly common I don't understand it

00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:48,720
why people mmm

00:37:50,230 --> 00:38:07,790
go back okay go back oh yes right

00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:09,530
another another excellent review yes it

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,410
proves that advogados trust metric

00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,410
system as a failure and it is absolutely

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,150
true I mean under under the assumptions

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,100
that this user you know brings to the

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,990
system of what he expects this distress

00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,880
metric to do it doesn't do what he wants

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:26,120
to do he expected it to keep out cranks

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,650
and very explicitly that was not the

00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,170
goal I mean if you go back to that book

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,120
example that you know I'm totally okay

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:37,850
with with with passing a few books out

00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:39,230
and you know another thing is that you

00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,120
know in terms of the mismatch of the

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,130
assumptions of the trust metric with the

00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,900
implementation is once you get your

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,610
certification once enough people say

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,320
well maybe you're a little cranky maybe

00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:51,560
your ideas are pretty good that's the

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,270
case in this particular example that you

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,350
can post as many articles as you like

00:38:53,270 --> 00:39:01,400
and in fact he was posted in quite a few

00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:04,070
so you know it all has to do with you

00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,420
know if I had come in and said the

00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,880
purpose of this trust metric is to keep

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,230
out cranks then I would have had a the

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,810
way I would have implemented that is

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:14,270
very simple I would have had a metadata

00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,370
of this user is a crank rate 1 to 10 and

00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,750
i guarantee you that he that the

00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,280
particular user that he linked here

00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,080
would have scored extremely highly on

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,840
that score it's an experiment that's

00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:27,350
well worth doing for future researchers

00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,840
that are out there so you know again I

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:31,490
can look in here that you get people

00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,840
there's no links there's nothing there's

00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,300
nothing actually bad that this person

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:40,730
has done except occupy space you know on

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:43,430
the on the new user list if they did

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:46,070
post you know your typical spam link

00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:52,340
then they're spams you know scores would

00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:54,140
have been increased so basically there's

00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,150
no way for me the question is is there

00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,190
any way to undo what you just did I

00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,470
don't have user interface for undoing

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,130
that the idea is that if one or two

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,569
people do it by accident

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,730
really hurt anything that's the

00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:07,799
threshold and then if too many people do

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,660
it then yes there's a manual process

00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:12,259
that the administrator confession

00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,359
account out of purgatory but that's only

00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:18,960
been required you know like once or

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,670
twice and in fact the cases where that's

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,890
happened you can look at the account and

00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,079
you can kind of you can kind of

00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:27,539
understand why why the account got

00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,799
clicked on you know I think there's

00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:32,849
there's more than one person with

00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:35,250
Asperger's who uses the site if we had

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:37,140
an Asperger's metric then I'm sure that

00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,380
user would have scored extremely high on

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,390
it as well so you know again you kind of

00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,529
have to fish through to find you know

00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,049
somebody who's doing really egregious

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:48,420
spammy behavior and if you look at the

00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:50,430
recent blog entries list there's maybe

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,259
maybe one spammer on it maybe not it's

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:57,089
an incredibly tiny amount of abuse

00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:58,950
considering how considering two

00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:05,549
parameters how open the system is and

00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:06,839
how little admin work goes in so yeah I

00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:09,390
mean there were a few cases of the

00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,000
overly zealous deletion but it wasn't a

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,049
big problem and again that the this was

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,579
a good case of the assumption it's

00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:16,890
pretty much matching the usage of the

00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,940
site that the amount of damage that you

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:23,250
can do by falsely flagging a spam is

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,809
somehow related I mean you know if you

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:28,049
get one or two people to come in and

00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:29,819
then want to poison the you know get get

00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:35,039
their certificate and then when a poison

00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:36,329
the spam scores they could but you know

00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,650
it probably wouldn't bring it over

00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:39,750
threshold it wouldn't really bring the

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:45,569
whole system down so this is really

00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:47,279
something that's worked question so the

00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,529
question is how many spams can one

00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:56,099
person mark as this blog is spam and at

00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:57,690
the moment there's no bound on that so

00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,039
the question is can you go in and mark

00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,740
the same person as spam in the answer

00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,849
that is know that that okay I thought

00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,279
you were saying how many different

00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:07,529
people can you mark as spam right so you

00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:09,720
so so you do have this kind of limiting

00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:11,400
behavior where your ability to do damage

00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,559
you know where you can say I want to

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,599
mark this person and spam because i

00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,030
don't like them that your ability to do

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,530
that is

00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:23,170
fairly limited and we haven't seen that

00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:24,610
particular abuse happen so the question

00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,410
is if you can coerce other people to do

00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,570
that and that's absolutely true so the

00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,730
idea is we're not this is what attack

00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,830
resistance means attack resistance does

00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,470
not mean that the system is completely

00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:36,910
proof against any attack that there's an

00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,370
impossible to make these things happen

00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,980
it means if you want to do that you have

00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:44,020
to do more work you have to increase the

00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,860
cost of your attack where you're doing

00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,270
stuff like convincing other people to

00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:52,840
send in those flags once you've reached

00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,390
that that that level of being able to

00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,000
pull off that attack then there's no

00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,790
hope fortunately we're not seeing that

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,090
in the real world just yet we're in good

00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:07,690
shape so one of the other one of the

00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:09,340
other take-home lessons that I want to

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,380
get across because I think I think this

00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,550
one has a lot more relevance in terms of

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,010
you know other people employing these

00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:17,230
kind of systems is that transparency and

00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,450
openness really works or at least this

00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,670
is an instance of transparency and

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:25,510
openness really working all of the

00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,120
details all of the secrets of how spam

00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:30,220
how the system keeps out spam you know

00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,110
if you're thinking like how would I go

00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,320
into the system and make it except my

00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:38,500
spam and you know the page rank is very

00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,930
high very worthwhile to get spam into

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,120
this system are completely public you

00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:47,350
can just go in read the code figure it

00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,750
out and you know the system is also very

00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:52,540
open almost as open as the day that it

00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,070
was created there is really isn't about

00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,270
creating barriers and saying it's going

00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,100
to be very difficult because of all of

00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:01,150
our spam filters that you need to get

00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,530
around and also you know a very small

00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,140
amount of manual work which is not

00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,760
something that you see when you look at

00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,050
the site it's kind of hard to tell the

00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,810
difference between something that's

00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:13,090
inherently spam resistant and an army of

00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:18,700
deletion monkeys behind the behind the

00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:20,920
scenes so insecurity in cryptography you

00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,530
know a lot of companies try and achieve

00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,210
security through obscurity and in the

00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,890
security world in the cryptography world

00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,190
that gets you laughed out of the room

00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,680
and

00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,720
and I think without you know I again

00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,210
I've got it was one data point that

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,369
that's probably true in in the world of

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,589
these of these reputation systems as

00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:41,480
well that ultimately if you have to keep

00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:46,730
the details secret to think that you're

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:48,800
secure it probably isn't so again you

00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,530
know I forgot I was a modest success it

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,420
did it did some things well other things

00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,710
not so well it didn't really catch on

00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,190
you didn't really catch people's

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,810
attention on fire so why you know if it

00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:03,170
works so well as well as I'm saying why

00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:04,339
isn't everybody using it and like you

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,810
know everything else there's probably a

00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:08,810
combination of lots of different reasons

00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:11,060
the the code base itself I'm programmer

00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:13,720
so when I wrote this I wrote it in my

00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,849
most comfortable language which is C and

00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,680
you would never do that you know please

00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:22,130
if you write something like this then

00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,440
please write it in Python um I didn't

00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,000
publish enough I didn't do enough self

00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,750
promotion I'm here doing this talk I

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,670
think that helps but I in retrospect if

00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,770
I really wanted to push these ideas out

00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:36,260
there you know I could have done a lot

00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,640
more of that work and then as I say that

00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,050
you know if you just look at the site

00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,510
it's it's very difficult to tell how

00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:43,550
much of it is really the inherent

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,589
properties of this site and how much of

00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,150
it is you know somebody sitting behind

00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:50,089
the scenes making it look a lot better

00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:53,960
than it really is but the good news is

00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:56,750
that people are starting to care now I

00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,210
mean this talk is one of maybe a half

00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:02,930
dozen that you know some internal some

00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:06,800
external at Google on reputation social

00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:08,900
networks etc it seems to be that people

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,319
understand that the social network is

00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:14,329
powerful and spammers are powerful and

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,980
hopefully the social network is more

00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:19,970
powerful but that's where the battle is

00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,520
is taking place and I'm fortunate that

00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:24,400
I'm a member of the comment abuse tools

00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,790
team here i'm working on these things

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,130
and i'm really happy because you know i

00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,900
think a lot of people's goals are now

00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,480
align i'm interested in solving these

00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,119
problems users are interested in not

00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,400
having to fight spam and of course you

00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,570
know there's real bottom line impact for

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,380
google

00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:48,260
as a money-making entity in terms of

00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,060
whether these are well-functioning

00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,360
products or whether they're infested

00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:56,870
with with spam and abuse so I think

00:46:53,360 --> 00:47:00,860
that's my talk musi yes that's it so I'm

00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:03,070
really happy to take questions or from

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,070
the back

00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,950
so the question is that I built this as

00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,750
a closed system that really you know

00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,150
everything working on a single server

00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,680
and could I have deployed it as a highly

00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,589
decentralized system and the answer to

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,030
that is absolutely that that was really

00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:23,890
the original goal the original goal was

00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:26,289
to build a something that wasn't a

00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,609
broken DNS that wasn't depending on kind

00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:29,980
of the verisign at the top of the

00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,780
hierarchy and the reason that I built it

00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,210
as a single closed site is that it was

00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,440
it was much simpler to do that and that

00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:39,849
I kind of wanted to separate out the

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,260
possibilities of failure that it's

00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:43,000
entirely possible that all of the ideas

00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,280
were really good but I just didn't know

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,670
how to build a widely distributed system

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,430
well these days you know I mean have

00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,500
distributed authentication mechanisms as

00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:55,240
opposed to distributed trust like the

00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,440
open ID talk that was earlier today

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:02,500
again one of the one of the series and

00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,500
you know I I think that that making this

00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,059
thing scale up is one of the more

00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:14,520
interesting you know sort of future

00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:14,520
research directions to take it Monica

00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:32,250
so that absolutely so the question was

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,260
does the fact that this work have to do

00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,650
with the particular domain that i picked

00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,050
of the discussion of being open source

00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:41,550
programmers which may be according to

00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,410
the kind of implicit assumption of the

00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:47,850
question are not as contentious as other

00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:50,190
i'm not sure that's true and i think the

00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,800
answer to that is that that when you

00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:54,600
look at the the population of the

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,900
spammers and abusers you know they're

00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,460
they're posting links on on viagra so I

00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,270
think you're going to see more or less

00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:05,100
the same spam and abuse no matter which

00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:07,560
population of legitimate users that you

00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:12,360
pick so it's hard to know the answer for

00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:15,270
sure until you actually do it but my gut

00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,640
feeling is that that the the success you

00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:19,890
know as so much as you've seen it is not

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,390
just to do to the to the nature of the

00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,390
of the domain

00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,590
or something

00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:47,920
so so I'm supposed to repeat the

00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:53,530
questions and that was a little

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,200
complicated but it basically let me see

00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,970
if I can get the gist of it across that

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,200
you know if you had a domain that was

00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,880
more contentious would you want to have

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,470
multiple different kinds of metrics that

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,330
were being ranked other than just how

00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:07,920
interesting is this person's blog is

00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,920
that is that the gist of the question or

00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:32,260
right yes okay publicity attack from

00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:34,690
being contentious so advocate so I guess

00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,060
the answer to that question is that

00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,260
advogado does not because of the because

00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,090
it's just not in one of these

00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,890
politically contentious you know spaces

00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:44,890
that as an experiment it doesn't really

00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:47,170
answer that question that said there is

00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:49,450
a lot of really interesting work out

00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,830
there that if you look at the clever

00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,780
algorithms that were done by Joe

00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:55,380
Kleinberg at IBM research that later

00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,610
became part of the tail MA search engine

00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,980
that they actually started looking at

00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:03,160
the second eigen vectors and third eigen

00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,260
vectors of the matrix so that you know

00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,850
sort of link adjacency matrix of the web

00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,990
and one of the examples out of their

00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,640
paper that I thought was really

00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:12,160
fascinating is that if you look at the

00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,930
second eigenvector on a search of

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,170
abortion that you'll see this really

00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:19,450
clean separation into sort of you know

00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:20,650
pro-life pro-choice camps that you could

00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,000
just by looking at the link structure

00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,850
without doing any kind of semantic

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,170
analysis or any kind of you know

00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:27,370
self-identification as one camp or the

00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,860
other that just looking at the link

00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:31,720
structure you can extract that so my gut

00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,040
feeling is that if that data is

00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,900
interesting if that is what you're

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,450
trying to extract out of a social

00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:40,270
network that that that the data is there

00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:42,250
that the tools the techniques actually

00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:44,770
can bring a great deal of power to that

00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,470
question but as far as did advogado

00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:49,840
answer any of those questions then no it

00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:52,980
did not it that was not part of the

00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,980
scope of the experiment

00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,940
how often do I update the eigenvectors I

00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,770
believe that that calculation is every

00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,690
four hours but it sort of depends on

00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:06,820
load and so on and so forth its it

00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,520
that's an implementation detail that

00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:16,510
it's kind of less interesting to me

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:19,420
personally the question is is it

00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:22,360
computationally expensive so um the

00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,730
answer is that in the implementation as

00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,740
it exists now it's it's not so much

00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,690
computationally expensive that the

00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,970
bottlenecks happen to be getting the

00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:33,670
data in and out of the database which

00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:36,070
because I sort of drank too much of the

00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:38,260
xml Kool Aid is all XML files and a flat

00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,970
file system and that's very inefficient

00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,710
and the other thing that makes that more

00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,510
expensive than it should be is that it's

00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:45,700
actually calculating the local view of

00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:47,800
all 13 thousand users in the system that

00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,320
it's computing different scores you know

00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,890
if I see something that's a 9.3 then

00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,910
somebody else might see it as a 4.1 and

00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,770
actually in response to an earlier

00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,180
question that if you do have something

00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:00,160
that's contentious if you do have a

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,260
thing with with kind of wars of people

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,210
within one cluster ranking down somebody

00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,820
in the other cluster then what you would

00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:10,270
expect to see is you would expect to see

00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:12,610
this local you know this locally

00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,410
relevant score which again is relatively

00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:16,000
expensive in as the system scales up

00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:18,130
then the cost of computing that becomes

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,200
unrealistically large and you would need

00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:22,780
to do things like figured out clusters

00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,560
and so on and so forth but again you

00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,180
know that was one of the nice things

00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,310
about this that I had a modestly

00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:29,560
successful I was supposed to run away

00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:31,270
successful system so it was very

00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,420
practical for me to do this experiment

00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:37,720
on us on a site with only 13,000 you

00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:44,230
know nodes I won't have that luxury here

00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:45,940
at Google any other questions ok well

00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:50,580
thanks very much for coming out i really

00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,580
appreciated being able to give this talk

00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,870
