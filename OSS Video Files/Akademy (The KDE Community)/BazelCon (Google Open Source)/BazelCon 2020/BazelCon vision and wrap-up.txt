i'm a vp of engineering at google my

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
teams are responsible for building

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,240
and operating developer tools and

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,359
infrastructure for our internet

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
developers

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,760
external enterprise developers and open

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
source community like yourself

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,400

sharing some highlights and talking

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
about a broader developer tooling

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,360
vision first of all i want to thank you

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
great event

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,800
the two-day virtual conference brought

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
together the bezel community

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,920
the build ecosystem for our knowledge

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,199
sharing networking and collaboration

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,320
with over 1300 attendees presentations

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,559
by googlers

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,440
as well as talks from built thought

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,640
leaders

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,320
from twitter dropbox uber

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
pinterest grab taxi and others bazel con

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,159
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
was an event like no other for built

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,840
tooling

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
many attendees enjoyed the keynote

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,799
announcements

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,040
the migration stories at twitter

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,840
pinterest and cargurus

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
as well as the technical deep dives on

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
bazel persistent workers

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
in compatible target skipping and

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,799
migrating

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,200
from gradle to bazel what stood out to

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,600
me

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
from our first virtual bazel con was

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,880
that even though

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,040
we were on different continents it felt

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,360
like we were all in the same room

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
this was a good collaborative respectful

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
community energy with folks who are

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
passionate about bazel

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,479
and how it helps them and their

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
organizations

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,880
the work on incompatible target skipping

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,720
was a great example

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,880
for successful collaboration between

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
external contributors like yourself

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
and googlers and deserves to be

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,439
highlighted i heard

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
in the slack discussions i am so excited

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,119
by incompatible target skipping getting

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,879
over the line

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,920
we are seeing the emergence and

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,400
convergence of advanced ci workflows

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,360
outside of google as companies scale

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,160
beyond

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
build bazel it's exciting to see this

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,959
level of commitment

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,640
from bazel community to the parts of

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,680
basil that

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,680
make this scaling possible

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
another thing that stood out to me was

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,560
the enthusiasm of external dependencies

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
work

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
as well as bazel's long-term support

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,920
releases

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
thank you for validating these

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,080
initiatives and that matters to you

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,680
and that we are heading in the right

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,680
direction for both

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,519
google and the community lastly

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,599
thank you for the feedback where we

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,720
haven't met your expectations

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,040
regarding managing prs and github issues

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
we are actively working on streaming the

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
process

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,760
of managing incoming issues and prs

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
triaging our backlog and updating our

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
roadmaps

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,040
we are also wanting to be more

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,760
transparent about areas

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,280
where we are prepared to handle prs for

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
example categorizing them

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,080
as welcome prs we should talk first

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,519
or sorry no we will be crafting and

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
sharing a process

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,000
for better interaction in these areas in

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
the coming quarter or two

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
i'm especially excited about the

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
arrangements of android platform

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,239
migrating to bazel

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,560
google's investment in building android

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,159
signals increasing support for bazel and

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
the community

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,879
i was encouraged by the great reaction

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,280
since it is a significant multi-year

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,959
multi-quarter effort that will have a

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
great impact on both

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,920
the android platform android partners

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,959
and the bazel community

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,599
i saw comments on twitter such as

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,640
this is huge this is really good for the

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,439
ecosystem

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,519
awesome to see this happening finally i

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
have been wanting this since i moved

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,000
over to a team

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,920
developing an android os so many

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
features i'm excited to test out

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
android is experienced by end users

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
mostly through our

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
partners consequently benefits to our

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,519
partners being productive

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,919
are benefits to our mutual end users

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,040
receiving the best experience of android

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,440
that they could this migration

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
in definitive benefits for android

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,280
platform developers

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
and partners including significantly

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,759
improving build speeds

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
enabling hermetic builds and lowering

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,840
costs to building

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,479
android aosp which leads to happier

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440
developers

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,840
greater productivity and efficiency now

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,080
i want to refer back to the bazel vision

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,639
mentioned in the opening keynote any

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,240
software developer can efficiently build

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,280
test and package any project of any size

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
or complexity with tooling that's easy

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,520
to adopt and extend

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,720
but what is our vision beyond building

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
projects

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,880
and what are our development principles

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
google like other organizations has

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,680
encountered many challenges

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,120
as growth of the code base outstrips the

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
ability for developer tools to keep up

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
there are too many repositories with too

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,360
many dependencies

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
on many different versions of libraries

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
a proliferation of

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,800
programming languages used to build

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,600
applications and systems

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
a need for fast correct and harmonic

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,440
builds

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
enabling rapid iterative development

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,759
the ability to secure our systems from

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,479
unauthorized and unknown code changes

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
certify all changes to source code as it

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
moves through the software development

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,880
life cycle

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,360
this is why we always build from source

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
the requirement to provide seamless code

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
sync

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
fast bills scalable code reviews and

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,360
comprehensive code

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
search and meaningful build and test

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
results

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,800
for tens of thousands of developers

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,520
across the globe

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,479
we are keeping android aosp an important

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
priority

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
as we build a more integrated

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,840
development experience

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,759
to support the android platform

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,479
ecosystem built

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,639
upon the bazel platform this includes

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
creating a great all-around android

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,680
platform development experience

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,960
based on a loosely coupled but well

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,479
integrated build

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,360
source and workflow systems that can be

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,000
used together

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
on a well-lit path for developers and

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,479
where the tools can be leveraged

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
separately

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,479
to support an existing workflow

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,880
we plan on investing substantially more

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,440
in supporting aosp development

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
such that through bazel as a platform

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,639
android platform developers

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,960
are able to easily share build

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
and test results with other developers

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,360
to speed

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
problem diagnosis farm out hundreds to

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
thousands of

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,960
tests to run into parallel

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,919
to quickly vet code changes

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
selectively run tests that are impacted

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,880
by

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,560
specific code changes during continuous

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
integration

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
developed from a cloud-based ide that

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,599
builds through a hosted

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,599
bazel built environment

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,360
we are focused on making bazel a great

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
platform and a great experience

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,599
for rules owners and developers this

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
means being very clear about what google

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,160
will provide and where we need your help

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,319
what google will provide a great

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
out-of-box experience for the core build

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
systems

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
and selected programming models and

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,879
execution platforms

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,120
extensibility via starlark the build api

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,440
and abstractions such as platforms

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,240
toolchains and aspects

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,599
support for services via open apis such

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
as remote execution

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,520
and the build event protocol

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
productivity tools

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,120
such as build dozer and execution

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
profiling

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
stable supported releases every nine

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,520
months

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,800
community support and coordination

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,240
example for role interoperability

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,080
there are a number of efforts that

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
google will look to the community to

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
help

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
and partner with in the future for

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
example

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
ad rule support for languages and

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,400
platform not supported by google

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,319
implement tools to support migration to

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,760
bazel from other to build

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,360
and test systems develop bazel

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,519
integrated cloud services

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,360
for remote execution ci build results

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,560
provide consulting and enterprise

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,800
services via bazel experts

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,240
google is committed to open source for

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
the long term

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,920
google depends critically on open source

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
software

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,080
we use it to build our systems we

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
develop it for others to extend

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,839
we need great open source tools to

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
support building

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,040
and testing both the software we use

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
internally

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
and the software we develop which is why

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,480
we are committed to bazel

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
and the community like yourself we look

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,279
forward to partnering more deeply with

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
this community

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,600
to create optimized journeys that ensure

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,160
great velocity

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,880
productivity and happiness for the bazel

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,399
developer community and ecosystem

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:37,680
thank you everyone and see you at

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:37,680
