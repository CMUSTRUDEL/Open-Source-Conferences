Title: Adopting Bazel in a quickly scaling organization
Publication date: 2020-11-13
Playlist: BazelCon 2020
Description: 
	CarGurus is a rapidly growing software engineering organization. As we scaled, our build process degraded to the point where it had a heavy impact on productivity. Enter Bazel. We embarked on a journey to make our builds faster, easier to understand for our developers, more observable, and sustainable to the point where tech-debt (a.k.a. “dependency hell”) is handled up-front. 
Bazel is now rolled out in our org, and it has not only sped up our builds, but it serves as the core interface for how teams declare and orchestrate every part of their build and delivery process. In 10 months, I went from knowing next to nothing about the then pre-1.0 build tool to working with the Bazel community and our engineers to bring the best experience to CarGurus possible. 
We share key observations and pitfalls we encountered while trying to move quickly.
