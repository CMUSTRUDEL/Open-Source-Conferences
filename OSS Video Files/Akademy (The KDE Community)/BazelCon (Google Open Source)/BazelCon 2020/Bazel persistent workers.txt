Title: Bazel persistent workers
Publication date: 2020-11-10
Playlist: BazelCon 2020
Description: 
	These amazing workers are cutting Bazel build times in half! Bazel can amortize startup costs and enable cross-action caching by using long-running worker processes. In this talk, we explain how to use, create and tune workers, introduce multiplex workers, and discuss how the worker protocol is evolving.
