Title: Akademy 2021 - KDE is All About the Apps
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Aleix Pol Gonzalez
Our Goal is to get more apps onto more app stores by empowering the app developers and integrating the release process into the stores and into the apps. Changing the culture of KDE to deploy our own apps. This talk will look at progress and barriers to the goal.

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
so

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,400
let me welcome alice again this time no

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,160
sas the kde

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,199
ev president but as the gold champion

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,240
for the kde goals

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:31,470
it's all about the apps

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,040
take it away

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,680
[Music]

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,040
uh thank you adam um the slides

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,160
can somebody put them on in the meantime

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,399
i'm gonna introduce myself

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,880
my name is alesh like you can now see on

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,360
the slides

00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,000
[Music]

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
and i'm gonna talk about the kitty it's

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,480
all about the abs goal

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,920
a goal that was led by by jonathan until

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,930
until recently and oh jonathan hi and

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,139
well thanks a lot for all of your work

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,139
[Music]

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,159
the arrows don't work

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
all right well um like it says here and

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,560
like i'm sad

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,680
i am also the kdb president right now

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,680
but also been have been developing uh

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,159
kd software for what i generally say

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
for over a decade but it's almost a

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,960
decade and a half now

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,720
uh and i actually started developing

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,920
apps in particular uh key algebra

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,280
even before i i started developing kde

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
because the application

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,880
started outside which i think it's it's

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
interesting in the apps kind of

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,960
perspective in that

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
well you can be a small project you

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
don't have to be

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,920
like a whole community around something

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
like you sometimes end up being but you

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
can

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
just do it from from from home rather

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
easily

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
in this case my home was and

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
incidentally still is

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,239
uh in barcelona and

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,319
well when i'm not making apps i am

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,360
working for blue systems

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,360
also developing hd software around

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,040
now i would i wanted to give a little

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,319
bit this context

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,879
in that uh kitty has had apps for very

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,480
long time

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,840
right like in fact it would be very

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
difficult to imagine a community like

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,440
ours

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,120
without absent itself apps being well

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,000
whatever is that the user is interacting

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,959
with the system that doesn't feel like

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
it's on the background right nobody

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,680
would consider

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,160
maybe uh that the plasma is

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
an app in itself like the plasma shell

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,840
what it would consider

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,879
i don't know i guess windows is

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,400
not sure what the right uh components

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
there are of their or

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
a mac os on android also it's very clear

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
this distinction

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
like in general apps are something that

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,440
you can sometimes install that you can

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,360
uninstall eventually unless you're using

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,680
an evil operating system

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,040
and it also has the advantage that

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,440
like i said earlier you can be

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,319
having some kind of problem and say i

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,200
want to have

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,920
a piece of software uh that solves this

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
and that i

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,280
i can interact with in in my systems

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
and and then you can just use an

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
application

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,680
to to do that

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
and you can do that without having to

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,760
well implement a whole operating system

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,280
which is uh well not all that desirable

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,159
um in kde for example

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,760
i am pretty sure that the first

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
contributions were

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,200
the window manager of course because if

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,560
you don't have

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,920
uh windows you don't have well anything

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,159
you can interact with

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,159
but then i'm pretty sure maybe like the

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,280
second or third uh

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,560
big steps were probably what ended up

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,040
becoming conqueror and what ended up

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,280
becoming i guess the system settings

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,759
applications right because

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,880
well how are you gonna interact with

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,240
your system

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,800
beyond beyond those windows uh

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
and in kde we've had very famous

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
applications that

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
have been developed since the very

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,199
beginning and

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,560
nowadays are super popular

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,120
thinking about uh kate or ocular

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
ocular well it changed names over time

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,880
but

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
well there there are things that were

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
necessary

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,080
25 years ago or so and well are still

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,520
necessary today and and we still

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,520
we still develop them

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,440
okay that went a bit uh

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,400
direct so what i wanted to discuss today

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,320
is

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,120
um a bit the process i have been going

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,639
through when

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,280
starting to look into the abs topic

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
now let's see what we've been

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
distributing

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520
overall what we've been

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,880
how we've been reaching to our users and

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,479
and seeing what kind of things have been

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
working and

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,960
about more or less or what kind of

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,840
things uh

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:49,919
could be improved uh more in terms of

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,800
our um publishing platforms rather than

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
actual features in in each of every

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
application

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,759
because well my plan like i'm gonna

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,240
discuss a bit later on is to

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,120
well be talking with the different uh

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
communities

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,600
over over the next

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,240
few months and and discuss how we can

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,560
improve

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,000
these the situation and make sure that

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,360
that the the experience from

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
those kd products uh is as optimal as

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
possible

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,400
uh on on each of the platforms and well

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,680
that we can we can make the most out of

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,479
out of our work both in

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
our perspective but also for our users

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
because in practice well

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
you never develop a project without

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,280
having a user in mind and

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
caring for a user

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,199
we have in these fronts

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,160
maybe to be categories

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,319
there is um whatever is linux because

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,599
it's a big topic for us

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,280
uh i mean there's obviously as well the

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,960
sort of school releasing but

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,880
releasing source code doesn't really

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,080
give us much information

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,160
uh also we don't get to control very

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,120
well how our users use our software

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,280
which ends up meaning that you can be

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,800
developing an application

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,800
but then your users will be having

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,520
uh well problems that

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
come from it being a different version

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,840
or something like that right

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
so i think that's from a perspective

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,639
what we're interested in

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,960
is uh on positioning ourselves in

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
the situation where we're in in control

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,240
of

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,599
um the thing that our users

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,759
get to use if they want to have

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,960
the optimal experience that we consider

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
they can have

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,080
and then optimizing for that workflow

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
right

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,280
um

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,199
starting with linux oh i have

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,199
uh starting with linux uh started

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,840
looking at snap they do have

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,840
a very interesting and big

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,440
dashboards with with information and i

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,720
thought well let's see who

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,000
uh is using or what what it looks like

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
uh our presence there um something that

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
we can see

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,240
over there straight away is that um

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,000
the kitty frameworks an app which isn't

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,159
an application in itself

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,479
but one platform to create applications

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,120
has reported over half a million um

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,240
active devices that supposedly means i

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,040
don't know the actual

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
definition but they are devices that are

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,760
actively

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
actively being used it's not like that

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
install that you did one day

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
and then you forgot about but it's

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,080
something that you regularly

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,880
are starting um this happens because

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,000
there's

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,200
well all of our apps are based on that

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,680
uh platform uh but

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,240
but not only ours since we're providing

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
a platform for uh cute applications

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
which is

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,720
what we generally do um there's

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
other components from elsewhere that

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,600
they decide to

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
rely on the work from the kitty

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,080
community so that they don't have to

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,600
um to create to compile to build all of

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,360
these components once again

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,320
it also allows their users to

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
share these this content with with us

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
and

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,399
will not have it duplicated uh

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,399
several times on their systems um

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
as far as our apps goes you will see

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
that

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
it's kind of generally always the the

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,760
same components that are the most

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,880
uh used uh

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,680
everywhere here we can see that ocular

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,360
and krita i had to go like one one by

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
one through them so i hope i didn't

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,040
forget

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,839
other top ones but those were the two

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
that i saw that

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
had the most installations krita nucular

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,079
had

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,880
over 50 000 active devices

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,959
now this doesn't sound like a whole lot

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
admittedly but then let's remember that

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,279
this

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,720
is just a way for um

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,920
ubuntu users to install

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,800
their applications or well any linux

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,959
users

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
could be potentially using those snaps

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,320
but

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,040
well they have other alternatives we'll

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,160
go through

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,680
some of them like flat back or abdomen

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,040
but then there's also the distribution

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
packages

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
for which we don't really have much much

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
information or i don't really know how

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,280
to

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,720
how to get um

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,720
[Music]

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,000
those two like i said around 50 000

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,160
devices but then the

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
there's a whole lot of applications that

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
are between

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
like five thousand and fifty uh fifteen

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
thousand

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
uh division devices and then there's a

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
whole lot of applications listed over

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,760
there

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,760
over 100 i i counted again i had to

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,710
count like one by one

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
um

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,560
[Music]

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,320
thanks a lot to uh jonathan for a lot of

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:30,079
this work this has been

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,079
seems to be working very well

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
now

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,320
the other one we can look at

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,320
is a flat pack which would be

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,079
a very similar technology to to snap um

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,360
their information is a bit harder to

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,200
read uh

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,279
i'm talking about flatback here but then

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,639
those numbers are coming from flat hub

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,920
explicitly obviously i guess if you know

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,920
how the technology works

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,959
you don't have to register to their site

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,959
to

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,240
tell about yourself so they don't know

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,760
about active devices but

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,959
you do know about downloads because well

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,079
you have to serve them

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,200
so you can just as well count them and

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,320
and count on it the

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,880
the data is a bit harder to read but

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,000
we can see over there that we have the

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
platform again

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,959
being our most notable

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,160
component with so

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,040
what since what they're showing us

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,800
uh is is downloads over there what we

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
get is that whenever there's an update

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,639
there's a

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,320
big uh spike of of downloads

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,480
and well we could count those as

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
active devices i guess although that

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
wouldn't be entirely

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,240
right um the spikes were

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,680
went up to around 200 000 but

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,560
um well data number us

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,279
whatever it means to you you in krita

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,720
and aquila

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,399
again we could see between 5 000 and 10

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,320
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,639
spikes which again were

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,600
seemingly i didn't i wasn't able to go

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,040
through all of them

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,200
because again i had to go one by one but

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,639
uh but they they seem to be among the

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,839
most used ones uh well understandably

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,000
because they're very good apps

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,959
um but we do have

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
over 50 applications we do have a team

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,079
of

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
of people uh developing these in this

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,360
case

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,399
and but if you're interested in the

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
technology

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
uh join them by all means

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,480
um and then there's the rest of linux

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,639
there's a payment i don't really have

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,519
information on on the amount of users i

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,920
don't really know

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,760
if we have good ways of of measuring

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,120
them

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,279
maybe this is something that we could

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,880
include somewhere to

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,000
well be able to to to make this picture

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,959
a little bit fuller

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,240
but but it's generally complex not only

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,440
uh

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,760
no linux is true realistically it's uh

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
well asking their users to log in or or

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,079
anything but they're also

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,639
setting up um mirrors

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,760
and having mirrors sending information

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,279
would start uh

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,560
be even weirder so we don't really have

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,000
those numbers

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,360
um but we do know that they're in the

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,399
in the millions uh presumably and

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,920
i mean it it kind of makes sense in in

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
practice it's the way we've been

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,880
installing applications since forever in

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
linux and

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,079
it's what most distributions are

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,600
prepared to do

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:03,040
by default right

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,079
now in kde we've also been uh doing

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,519
other platforms for for the longest time

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
um i'm gonna try and go through them i'm

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,720
gonna start

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,000
through android android we do have

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
kdconnect which

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
incidentally is the only application

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,480
that

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,199
uh i've seen that isn't uh built

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,880
in in qt and c plus plus uh software

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,800
like we generally do

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:33,040
but it's it's built with android

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:37,600
normal technology being well java and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,639
well whatever that is called all of that

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,320
it has over 200

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,680
200 000 uh active installs being again

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:52,000
that we know that they're fully tracked

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:56,240
also kdconnect is on asteroid uh meaning

00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,399
that um there are potentially more

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,440
users uh that we don't know about

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,160
we do have normal application normal 4kd

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
applications

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,240
also available for android um

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
we did have some on the play store

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,279
before

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,560
we were removed for four reasons

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,560
we are working on

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,839
trying to get them back again uh

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,360
with automatized uh systems uh at the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,759
moment

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
so far it's been working with android

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,519
nico and folger

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
specifically have been working a lot on

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,560
on that front

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,399
we have a whole lot applications that

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,959
are available over there

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,040
you can uh if you want to try it give it

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,040
a

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:51,519
a test by going to android and adding

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:54,079
our our repository or

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
or yeah that's that's a way to to test

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,399
it

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,800
you can also see them on on

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,839
binaryfactory.gd.org

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,040
where but you will see how everything

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,520
works

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,880
and yeah if you're interested in android

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,720
there is this matrix room slash

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
other things feel free to join it

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,880
there's also a mailing list

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,679
in case you want to send a big blow of

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,360
text

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,360
that you want us to read

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,160
while sitting down and sipping coffee

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,520
another very popular operating system i

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,559
don't know if you've heard of it

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,080
it's called windows windows has been one

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,080
of the

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,280
platforms that chris specifically has

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,440
been taking

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,880
more seriously uh you can see uh

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,559
well there are presentations hala

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,080
specifically on the topic

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,600
they have an amazing story over there

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,080
and i think it's super interesting i

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,160
recommend you to look at at hala's talk

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,480
in lies if you didn't see it but in any

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,640
case they have about

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
3 million active installations over

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,160
there which

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,039
is a super interesting number

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,840
all things considered but also we do

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,000
have

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,880
applications that we've been shipping

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,840
from our normal releases

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,720
uh into the windows store in this case k

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,000
ten ocular

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,600
we can see that they are in around 100

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
000 which is not in the millions like

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,559
krita but i think that it also shows

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,000
that

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,400
we do have a very nice chance over there

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,440
at adding value and and providing

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,880
something that

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,840
users can use i think that it's it's

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
useful to be to be there as a

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:51,039
as a way to introduce the the world into

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,640
the work our community does um

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,720
something that i didn't mention about

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
android but it's probably also

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
interesting is that for example android

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,039
it allows us to

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,240
test the the mobile use case

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,360
uh better than probably plasma mobile

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,840
can even do today

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,960
since oh everyone literally has a

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,480
an android device right now uh

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,880
in the case of windows well literally

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,320
it's very hard to buy devices without

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,640
windows installed

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,120
so all of these being able to just

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,640
have okay the applications running i

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,880
think that it's a

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
very important milestone and well

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,280
something that

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,760
that our some people in our community

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
are

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,160
doing very good work on uh again

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
they do have a matrix chat that you can

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,120
join is

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,960
on kd windows we've not been very

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,280
innovative on the names of our rooms but

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
well you can use that on your advantage

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:03,440
kd windows

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,440
on a matrix as well as the mailing list

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,880
the other one which is admittedly quite

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,919
uh famous as well is um

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,039
mac os nevertheless

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,799
we don't have numbers again i don't

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,480
think we have many applications on the

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,039
store

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,039
um we do have our account on the store

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,400
but i think that it's just being used to

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,880
um have a key so that we can

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
sign our packages but i don't think our

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
applications are

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,080
being listed over there so we don't have

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,000
numbers on

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,400
users of those i think that this could

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
be

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
something interesting i was mentioned

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
that

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,919
there is a somewhat stable community

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,159
around home brew that you can use

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,520
i've never used homebrew i barely know

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,960
what it is

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,080
so i i wouldn't know but in any case

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,159
if you have a mac you want to

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,120
use more kd applications and you would

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,840
like to help

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,880
you can join at kitty dash mac matrix

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,400
channel or the main

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,159
list and oh man sorry about the

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,400
focus thing um

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
join the chat mailing list and talk to

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
the

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
to the team i'm sure they will be

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
interested

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,240
like i said there's a bunch of

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
information that

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
we don't have there's linux also beyond

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,679
linux there's

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,679
the bsds for example and other

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
special operating systems that do have

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,320
kd applications

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
running and available we don't have

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,280
numbers over there

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
i would be surprised though that they

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,240
were on the scale of

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,799
the numbers we've been discussing

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,080
well at least the psds on linux i can

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,799
imagine that

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,919
like the rest of linux to be bigger than

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,039
flatbuck and

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,039
snap combined

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:14,000
so um kitty okay we're a community

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,039
we have a ton of products all of these

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,400
applications are released generally

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,520
separately um either

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,240
being within kde gear which is what

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,760
used to be called kd applications before

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,400
and it was called as well

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,200
kde source compilation i think it was

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
called

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,480
and it's been called different things

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,799
but it basically is

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:44,400
a regular release of useful pde software

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,120
that is meant to be used with plasma but

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
not

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,120
exclusively everything indicated gear

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,799
you should be able to use on other linux

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,080
systems or

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,720
maybe windows and or operating systems

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,320
as well

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,960
we can find there uh the big swedes that

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,640
we've been

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,320
um having within for the longest time

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,200
like kitty pimp gadiadu

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,720
kitty games there's also some

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,120
applications that

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,799
are in there separately like kitty

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,799
connect for example

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:22,080
or um neochat i believe

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,720
since recently or or maybe maybe

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,760
you know chat does really separately in

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,679
any case something we

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,880
need to mention as well we don't release

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,640
every application

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,919
uh in parallel there's some applications

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,440
that appear

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,720
um on their own and something worth

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,240
uh noticing is that right now we also

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
have a kitty gear mobile

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,520
which is a bunch of applications that

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,320
are sprouted

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
from well having a plasma mobile right

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,919
now and

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,200
having this need for well having

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,200
everything released and

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,000
neatly packaged well now we are having

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,760
these releases which i believe

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,880
are monthly but you can see all of the

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,840
icons over there

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
they look lovely

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,840
use them most of these applications by

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,799
the way you can generally use

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,559
on the desktop as well they're built

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,400
with kirigami which is a

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,600
pretty cool framework to create

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,760
applications on

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,360
and by the way there's gonna be a buff

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,840
about um

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,960
creating applications for plasma mobile

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,200
uh

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,559
on monday i believe well during the

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,039
birthdays so

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:36,559
feel free to join them um

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,120
there was a new website created for

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,440
listing applications uh properly it's

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,200
called appszodky.org

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,679
just take a look browse it a little bit

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,559
see if there's something that you always

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,520
wanted but you never knew it existed i

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,679
think it's it's

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,919
it's quite useful um it also has steric

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,720
links on how to install it on your

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,200
different platforms so it can make your

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,919
life

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,919
a bit easier

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,360
all right now as the goal

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
if you think that the different things

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,520
are

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,000
a bit too specific for you but you would

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,279
like to have the discussion at large

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,440
maybe because you're an application

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,120
developer maybe because

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,200
you think the problem is very important

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,640
feel free to join us on the matrix

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,799
channel we're going to have

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,960
buffs for a lot of the topics that we've

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,240
been discussing today

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,000
also during the week take a look

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,279
and don't hesitate to join you don't

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,720
need to ask for permission

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,279
you don't need to ask for uh

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,640
anything you can just go in there and

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
you have something in your mind that you

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,279
want

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,360
you would like to share and would be

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,640
useful just do it

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,760
um by all means and now i think that we

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,799
still have some time

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,799
for questions

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,440
hi thank you very much alex we yes we

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,600
still have time for questions although

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,600
no questions in the widget yet

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:23,279
luigi and i will of course monitor

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,039
and forward any of them

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,960
but maybe people are waiting for the um

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,480
round table session for the gold

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,960
champions when

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,559
a whole session dedicated for questions

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
and discussion with the gold champions

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,240
so maybe

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,640
maybe that's why we don't see any yet

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,320
well

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,960
i'll be there yes uh alex do you have

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
any

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
buffs that you would like to advertise

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
in the meantime

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,000
coming up this this week well you know i

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,480
do

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,760
and i think i already said so but they

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,200
can repeat

00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:01,039
on monday there's a bulbs for

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,240
linux applications uh

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:09,120
kd applications on mac on windows

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,120
on plasma mobile join them

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,000
we need you

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,000
[Music]

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,880
we should have the

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,960
uncle something i need you

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,440
in my buff yes okay we do have

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,760
questions coming in would you like me to

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,440
read them to you

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,720
yes on the kde

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,440
gear mobile mobile slide

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,480
what application was the one with the

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,480
blue square icon

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,559
i was fearing that this would happen it

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,679
looks like there's been a misrendering

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,399
of sorts

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,760
um when i looked at the slide on my

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,960
system it looked fine

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,399
it's a dialer it's uh it's in my system

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,520
it has a

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,440
small phone from the time where

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,279
phones were not mobile otherwise it

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,000
would be a rectangle in a rectangle

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,240
but no it looks like a phone kind of

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,240
thing

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,039
sorry next one is

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,679
do you think kde should focus on

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,159
one way of delivering gaps to users or

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:29,919
stick

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:30,880
to what that works best on each platform

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,000
well we cannot do

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,080
one for every platform right on

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,440
android you can you have to do apks and

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,240
google play on uh on windows you need to

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,360
be on the windows store

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,559
and i think that talking about these

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:55,039
more third-party platforms

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:58,559
catering to the system that the platform

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:02,159
puts at our reach

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,960
is the right way to go for many reasons

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,039
that i think that

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,799
are probably obvious otherwise we can

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,320
just discuss them

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,760
sometime on the buffs

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,399
i imagine you might be thinking about

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,600
linux and i think that

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,799
linux in this topic it's um a bit of a

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,640
moving target still

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:25,520
so i wouldn't see ourselves uh

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,279
well narrowing ourselves into one of

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,919
those

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,919
i think that there's things still to um

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,080
to uncover what will

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,120
uh what will be supported on every

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,840
distro

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,279
what what is monetization monetization

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,600
looking like on the different platforms

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,559
uh i think that there's a lot of topics

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,279
that are very important and

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,640
as technologists don't really pay

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,679
attention to

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,799
uh generally but they are going to

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,200
matter a lot

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,360
and doing this properly will make a huge

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,200
difference

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,120
as for now offering snubs and flat packs

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,520
for example doesn't seem to be

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,399
a huge burden well in practice we've

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,919
been packaging

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,120
all of our supper for like 50 distros or

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,399
so

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,000
well through the different teams in the

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,360
different distros but in practice it's

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,080
been done by people

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,080
all around the

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,279
projects so adding a couple of them

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,080
doesn't seem to be

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,000
all that bad and i'll like you could say

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,039
it's bringing a lot of users

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,240
already that trust in these solutions so

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,279
uh let's continue doing that as long as

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,880
it works and

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,799
when we see something that is

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,840
unequivocally

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,840
desirable let's go with it

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,600
okay a question from bjorn how about

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,159
using

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,519
k user feedback to estimate at least

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,840
lower boundary of

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,840
rest of linux users

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,679
we are using it for some applications

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,159
for example kate

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,159
is doing it already plasma is doing it

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,760
already

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,080
in practice what this means though is

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,679
not that you're counting

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,559
um people using

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,360
linux you're counting people who enables

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,919
the checkbox

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,880
right which is very important if you're

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,799
using

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,679
some of our software to enable that

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,679
checkbox so that

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,559
well we can get all of this information

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,679
and use it to develop our products

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,679
but in practice that would be always be

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,000
a crippled number like like just knowing

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,799
the people who does snap for example

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
right

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,919
it's a valid number it's a true number

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,320
i believe but it will still be a

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,159
crippled number

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,360
and by the way i am not saying that

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,399
we're ever gonna have

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,679
a non-crippled number in the free

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,799
software communities we

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,440
care about privacy and there's cases

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,919
where

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,279
you will not want your software to be

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,919
talking elsewhere

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,200
i'm saying cases it doesn't mean that

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,279
it's always the case

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
but you will always have the case where

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,720
you don't want your

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,200
system to be talking elsewhere

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,080
i see caser feedback as a good way to

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,360
communicate

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,799
what a portion of our

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,200
user base things and wants but

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,640
as for accounting users i hardly think

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,799
that it's going to be

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,279
the right way of doing it but that can

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,039
be proven wrong if you have a good plan

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:50,720
uh join our buffs our meetings

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,200
and let's see what we can do there

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,159
okay thanks uh the next question is from

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,080
bhushan

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,559
do you think that improving experience

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,919
of third-party developers who use kde

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,080
frameworks or libraries

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:10,480
should be part of this goal or that is a

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:13,840
slightly different goal it's definitely

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,840
an important topic for kde

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,640
i am not sure it's something that this

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,840
goal should be about because it's going

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,440
about the kd apps

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,640
but then for example like i said in the

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,960
in the beginning i started being a third

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,159
party developer of an app and i ended up

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,799
being

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,679
well who i am today which is very much

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,399
in kg

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,399
so there is definitely a path for a

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,519
third party application developer to

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,840
flourish into

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,720
something that benefits the community at

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,650
large

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,840
um

00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,760
[Music]

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,360
i mean we can try it uh improving the

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,200
developer experience is something that

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,399
has been part of our goals

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,399
in the past like well you all very well

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,039
know for example through the onboarding

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,039
goal

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,799
it's something we touched on it's

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,240
something we can touch over here

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,799
on on on some on some level

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,480
and some things that are definitely part

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,359
of the of this goal would definitely

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
have a good impact on our third party

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,520
developers so

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,079
i don't know uh join the

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,079
buffs and let's have the discussion

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,440
about what kind of things we can do in

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,440
practice it's not what i

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,480
am gonna do as a goal lay

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,079
anyway it's more about

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,679
well what kind of discussions we can

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,240
have so people who

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,520
are not doing work today because it's

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,280
not like i can

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,879
personally do any more kd work right now

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,760
but other people who join they have to

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,320
join us and see what kind of things they

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,240
can do

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,240
and then work together right

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,720
yeah okay we still have time for

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,520
questions this comes from benson what

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,240
was the first

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,839
app you developed and why did you

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:08,480
develop it

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:12,480
i started developing k-algebra because

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,680
i don't know i was 18 or so

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,599
and i

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,800
was bored i guess there was this

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,920
application that was

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,720
a similar-ish to very original

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,760
algebra that i quite liked when i was

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,400
studying

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,520
um well high school

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,280
and well i wanted to learn how to

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,680
implement the language specifically like

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
how to turn an expression into something

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,839
that

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,560
could be computed and

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,560
that's why i started doing algebra i

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,680
would like to say i wanted to help

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,880
teachers around the world and i did

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,440
but that wasn't ultimately my

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,880
first reason to do so the other reason

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,160
also was that i

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,000
was spending summer when i started uh

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,599
somewhere with very limited internet

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,359
connection and

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,000
well i needed something to practice my

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,839
flourishing c plus plus skills on back

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,920
then

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,400
or see even so

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
i started researching and i ended up

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,520
doing but

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,280
i actually remember going through the

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,320
process of like choosing which

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,520
toolkit to use if i had to be using

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,480
that cute thing or ttk or whatever

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,720
so i didn't come even from uh kda

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,359
perspective i just wanted to start

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:40,320
coding i had i was to start university

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,280
that year and well that's what i wanted

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,280
to do so i did it

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,920
okay we can squeeze one more in the

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,119
question comes

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,480
from fiestas what are the apps that

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,480
currently excite you the most

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,160
um well i find it really exciting how

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,400
we've we're having all of the plasma

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,720
mobile applications happening like

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,320
all of a sudden we have a ton of

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,720
kirigami applications that

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,760
in practice we could have had like three

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,280
years ago maybe

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,400
but the fact that we have on our phone

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,119
ready right now are suddenly available

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,560
right

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,640
so things like the podcast application

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,640
uh is something i welcome i am

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,880
personally a big

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,079
user of podcasts and being able to use

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,599
kd software for it

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,640
is something i am looking forward to

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,839
actually it's something that i was

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,960
thinking like

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,240
can i really uh reliably move into

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,640
plasma mobile

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,680
if i'm not gonna be able to listen to my

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,920
podcasts

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,040
and well it seems like this could be a

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,720
thing so

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,720
that's uh one problem less

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,560
but obviously there's a lot of

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,680
applications that uh

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,079
we use generally every day and we also

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,000
take for granted like dolphin it's

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,880
important that they still exist

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,640
the other one that we i am using every

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,800
day today and i wasn't using every day

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,040
like one year ago was neochat right

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:19,760
which is for connecting to matrix um

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,800
very well done very useful um

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,359
world dimension of course

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,800
yes next year we'll be using it for

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,800
expressing academy right

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,400
well let's not make assumptions of what

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,599
academy is going to look like today

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,400
in a year of course okay thank you very

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,320
much

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
alesh we'll see you later of course in

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,520
the in the event

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,880
but for now we'll be moving on to the

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:59,680
next tax sessions thank you very much

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:59,680
