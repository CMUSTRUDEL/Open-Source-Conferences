[Music]

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,280
okay

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,320
so um

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,000
i'm paul and uh

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,680
as you know i have been working with uh

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,760
promo the pro team since 2017.

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,000
anika my name is anika cooker and i have

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,800
it's been more than a year now with kde

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
and as everybody knows that i am working

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,239
with the promo team

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
yes so

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:49,360
um this

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:54,079
this talking about because back in 2018

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,520
uh i was in vienna

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,960
like many of you were also and somebody

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,239
came up to me you know i was minding my

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,160
own business and doing stuff

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,520
somebody came up to me and asked me why

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
are you here just

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
just like that point blank and you know

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
being in vienna i thought it was pretty

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,040
obvious i was there

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,880
to drink beer it's mitchell and

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,880
stuff sasha talked into my face

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,080
oh of course to attend academy too but

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,280
the person asking that question was

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,960
not asking that he was asking

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,240
um why do we need

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
promo in

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,439
kd why do we need a promo uh team

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
led by somebody who's a contractor blah

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,560
blah blah what was so important about

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,920
promo

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,200
basically this is the question this is

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,439
a duration of the idea that

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
um any product that is good enough

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,240
will sell itself will people will

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,280
will would go to it it's this idea that

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,440
if the product is good people will come

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
so the problem with that is that that

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
idea is false

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,319
that idea is uh and has been proven

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
false

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,879
several times um several times

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
nearly every time uh

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
in the real world uh over and over again

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,680
so for example

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
if we go to an area that we know well

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
which is

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,239
um that of operating systems

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,000
think of windows vista this was

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:43,200
an unmitigated disaster um

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
by any measure it was buggy it was leaky

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,560
it was hoggy

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,640
you know the lots of resources

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,480
but microsoft managed to sell 20 million

00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:01,120
um copies in the first month that is not

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:05,599
20 million uh machines installed this is

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,879
people going out to buy a box

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,680
with a disc in it that contained

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,680
windows vista

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
and over the next year windows vista

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,480
went on to reach

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:24,799
40 percent of the pc market

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,920
um this was back in 2007

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,280
uh meanwhile the linux desktop which i

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,319
think that everybody would admit here

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
even at the time was well

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,840
i think that was probably better than

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,159
windows vista for

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,440
several reasons was at best two percent

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,640
apparently last year it peaked at three

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
percent

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,280
but then went back to two percent so

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
that's nearly fifteen years later

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
uh we are still more or less in the same

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,400
place

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,400
so my question is

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,959
is way too high asking for adjustment

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,040
okay one second

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
uh it's too loud is it guys sorry

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,840
oh maybe that's just me you know

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:36,400
anybody's ears okay the thing is that

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,639
so 15 years later

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,840
we are not in a in a much better

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,919
position

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,400
um so

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,919
do you think that people

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,720
the people that went um uh

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,720
and bought those the people that went

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,520
and bought those 20 million box sets

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,479
or window vista did it because the

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,479
product was good

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,360
no so what do you think pushed them to

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
pop down to to walmart or target or

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
whatever

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,520
and adds a box to their

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,680
to their shopping to their shopping cart

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
um

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
also also it could be something that i

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
have here that i'm going to show you i'm

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
going to show you

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
only a few seconds one second

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,840
let's see if i can grab the

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
thing

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
right

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,400
okay one moment i'm going to grab this

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,840
here we go full screen

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
hello

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:36,960
here we go

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,560
so often you experience something so new

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,560
some delightfully unexpected

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:49,840
there's only one word for it

00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,589
[Music]

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,720
okay i think that's enough um

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,080
this uh this this

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
this advertisement um triggers me so

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,080
much

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
uh i can't resist anymore but you know

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,199
maximum is the thing that the magnifying

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,520
the magnifying glass

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
the glass that comes by doesn't magnify

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,280
anything

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,280
but anyway um

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:33,440
so what's what happened uh let me

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,240
let me get back to this okay so

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
basically people knew they had to go and

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
buy

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
uh

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
a new copy of windows because they saw

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,080
an advertisement because someone told

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
them they had to go and buy it

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,319
they didn't come into their head just

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,599
out of nowhere or just because

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,520
developers created something

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,560
now um

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,319
this is what basically uh uh

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,599
promo office uh offers you

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,919
um we have worked

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:17,440
on kde uh for

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,800
now coming up for four years we have

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,400
increased um

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,319
kd's visibility we have

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,879
got our name in in new publications

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,680
we have increased the number of people

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,599
who

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,039
vis who read us on social media et

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
cetera et cetera

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,839
you all know this we we we we roll this

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
up we wrote this information out every

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,959
single time

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,240
we we talk um but

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:52,800
what you probably are not aware of that

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,200
apart from working on kd as a whole

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,320
we also want to work with projects

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,279
individually

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
and even with developers individually if

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,519
they need it

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,880
no and uh we have been working

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,440
with with some projects um

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,120
so and we have even endorsements from

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,560
them for example

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,560
uh from brazil says having created

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
telegram groups cleaning live community

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
meetings

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
better promo release notes social media

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,600
presents etc has definitely helped

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,440
so yes thank you fareed from brazil

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,560
and that was from canadian live

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,680
obviously uh alexander from black plot

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,320
says uh the promo that they

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,920
we started working with lab plot in

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,920
october 2019

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,560
and he says that uh jews are starting to

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,600
use

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,240
uh promotion regularly to

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,720
to increase the visibility of lack plot

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
uh

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
map to the increase of number of emails

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
we're getting from new users

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,680
it increased the number of new followers

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,399
on twitter's

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,600
uh new people joining laplace room or

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,040
metrics

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,240
uh and two new active contributors

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
um this all we didn't have let's say one

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
year ago

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,920
so thanks alexander and then

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,440
we have a contributor from uh

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,959
the uk who says would promote things

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,279
again five stars

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,279
thank you david so

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,279
that

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,120
normally obviously

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
when there is a change in uh the project

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,680
the project

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,440
gets better visibility and better um

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,760
um more people

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,160
following them and more contribute etc

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
not for one reason alone obviously promo

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,440
is not the only

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
promotion is not the only reason

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,839
normally promotion is comes with a

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,079
package of

00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:02,079
of decisions that the maintainers uh uh

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:06,240
make like you know um

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:09,920
they ramp up promotion but also

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,279
uh they take a project that maybe was on

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
paul so because it had lost his

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,800
maintainer or because

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
it had had problems uh getting unstuck

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,560
from some anything and then

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
they resume and then they take on also

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,959
promotion

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,399
uh or the or they take the project in

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,720
another direction

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
uh it was headed and then they also add

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
promotion

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,200
it's not one thing uh that that

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,680
contributes to

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,399
this increasing visibility obviously but

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
it is difficult to imagine and that in

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,360
itself is a bit annoying because

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,240
we can't say okay definitely what we did

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,839
here

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,440
helped but uh

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,440
it is obvious what hasn't ever happened

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
is that the project has taken on more

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,720
promotion and has gotten worse

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,839
let's say that i mean that's not an

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,160
enormous thing but

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:08,560
okay so

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:12,639
one sec next slide here we go

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:16,240
so uh we obviously uh

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,880
apart from uh to to to improve

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
your projects etc we do things that you

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,480
probably don't

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,600
right uh one of the things we do is

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,440
uh i have a list here but and you and i

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
haven't got a slide with all

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
the the bullet points because this is

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,079
something we have to know but

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,720
i'm just gonna tell you right uh for

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,920
example

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,399
we study social media and then

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,279
design posts to get the biggest reaction

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,120
so

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,040
i'm going to show you i'm going to see

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,639
if this works a bit better this time and

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,320
i'm going to show you

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:56,160
something that

00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:01,120
we i was working on this past week

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,120
regarding social media give

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,160
let's hope this starts ah he's open

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,200
okay now

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
let's go here

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,440
right now

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,040
so we measure we take all this

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,040
information

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,560
from all the tweets that we ever post

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,880
on the kd community um

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
account this is two years worth of

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
tweets

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,959
right for example and i'm talking about

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,600
twitter because

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,519
it turns out it's really easy to it's

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,120
it's kind of the easiest to analyze for

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,160
us we but we also

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
uh do linkedin facebook reddit mastadon

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,720
etc

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,639
so we take that that data and we do

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
something like this for example let me

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,240
increase that so you can see better

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,000
what this is telling us is uh

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,199
the engagement per tweet that we receive

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,680
for each on each day and at each hour

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:13,360
so um the engagements are

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,399
that people or reply or they retweet

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,079
or uh they um uh what's the other thing

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,959
they can do oh they oh they like it

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,680
so right so we've got along the top the

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,560
days to

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,120
monday tuesday brother to sunday and on

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
the

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,000
left we have the times approximate times

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,320
uh utc

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
now the lighter the color the more

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,800
engagements

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,079
so as you can see we have

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,000
a cluster here of white cells that's

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,839
telling us

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,120
that uh this is probably a good time

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,639
and good days to

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,800
to post so when people come in and say

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,320
i want to post something about my blog

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,560
etc we may say

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
things like well wait until tuesday or

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,440
wait until wednesday or whatever

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,800
and we don't say that because uh

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
you know at the moment we don't want to

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
work or anything we say that because we

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
know

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,160
this we know that uh people

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,279
tend to engage more on these days and at

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,160
these times

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,720
i mean if you look uh along the the

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,199
right

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,480
if you look at the maximum number which

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,560
is 11 000

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,680
and the maximum number at the bottom is

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,959
15 thousand you have the ideal time

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:35,360
to post apparently is on wednesday

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,839
at eight o'clock utc right

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,199
now of course uh this is not the only

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,720
thing you have to take in mind you have

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,480
to take in mind for example the

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
impressions which is how many times your

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,199
post is going to be seen

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,279
and for that we have this table right

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,639
this is the number of impressions

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,199
that uh accumulated impressions we got

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,240
on these days and times and again

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,199
if we move along to the right 186 is the

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
highest number

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
and the highest number down here is 403

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,759
so again

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:10,639
the best time to be read to be seen

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,639
is on wednesday 18 o'clock utc

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,000
so let's get back

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,000
to the

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:27,040
presentation so this tells us

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,160
when to post for example so

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
this is one of the things we do we

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,920
analyze all this information

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,560
for you and then when you come in we can

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,120
tell you this the the ideal moment to

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
post

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
but not only that we can also tell you

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,240
the

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,639
the ideal way to focus your post

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
let me go on to the next slide here we

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,560
go

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:55,040
now um because we also analyze

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,600
um um analyzes maybe a very epileptic

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,639
word we also look at

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,600
what uh posts do well

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,640
depending on how they are phrased so

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,280
here we have two

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,600
two um posts that lead to the same thing

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,720
they were they were posted on the same

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,959
day one hour apart

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,640
they were posted to to reddit and as

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
well to twitter and facebook et cetera

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,400
et cetera

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,839
and as you can see the bottom one which

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,439
was posted first

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,799
got 29 upvotes and

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,440
has no comments right then it was posted

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,799
at the moment this screenshot was taken

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,880
it was posted

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,760
12 hours prior number one we posted by

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,799
accident

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,000
because we didn't realize that that uh

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,640
uh um somebody from cajun life had

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,799
already posted about the new

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,559
2104 release was put back

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,240
but we decided to leave it when we

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,200
realized we decided to leave it see what

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,840
happened

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,760
and what happened is it got this this is

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,840
the one that the protein public uh

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,799
posted and it got 76 uh up votes

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,000
um and it finally reached nearly 90 if i

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,760
remember right

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,520
and at the moment uh of taking the

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,280
screenshot had five comments it finally

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,160
went on to have 11. it's not

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,360
great it was not one of our most

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
successful posts

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,559
but you can see there's a substantial

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,600
difference

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:31,919
even though the one posted by kd

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:35,440
the taking live team was first

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:40,720
what is the difference the difference is

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,919
that the one the promo team

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,400
posted has much more information so

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
we normally do this thing of listing

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,200
three things

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,440
or so if we say cheating live uh

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
uh the new version has been has been

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,520
launched

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,960
and it has this this and this three

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,919
things

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,039
while the the prior one doesn't list

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,960
anything

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,480
so it's with the people who are reading

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
it they have less information they have

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
less

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,080
reason to upvote it they have less these

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,559
reason

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,080
to talk about it so this is the other

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,720
thing we do

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
we look at all these things and we

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
decide

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
not only when's the perfect moment to

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
post well perfect there's nothing

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
perfect but

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,720
when's a good moment to post we also

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,000
once you tell us what you want to do we

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
can also tell you

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,360
how you should focus it what information

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,400
you should include

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,840
another classic we discovered

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,880
that or in a whole year of

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:48,080
of tweets uh the bottom 100 tweets

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,600
had no uh pictures whatsoever while the

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
top 100 tweets had

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
all of them had pictures included with

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,640
them which led us to conclude

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,919
maybe wrongly but we think we are right

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,360
let us to conclude

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,000
that we should always send out a tweet

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,200
with a picture that's why when somebody

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
comes in and says

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,880
could you tweet this we say okay what

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,240
image do you want

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,280
and then what text do you want

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,559
and we usually give it uh we have some

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,159
talk so it's not just

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,520
you know tweeting out stuff and letting

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,280
it go just

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
we have to um

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,559
uh give it a spin we have to look for

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,159
we have to look for an appropriate image

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,679
et cetera et cetera also

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
another thing we discovered is that

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,320
brightly colored

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,880
with lots of busy stuff going on images

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,240
are do better than simply grey windows

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,000
so when we post

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,000
a screenshot of one of kd's applications

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,520
there's always something going on it's

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,200
not an empty

00:20:49,520 --> 00:21:02,400
uh screenshot

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:06,320
right so

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,720
so the other thing we do is we

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,559
when we write announcements or somebody

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,760
comes with a blog post

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,840
and wants us to go over it or talk about

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,840
it or whatever

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
we um

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,919
engineer the text we rewrite the text

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,880
so it has a maximum appeal to the

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,080
audience

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
you want to reach reach we you will see

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,120
this

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
in for example the the plasma

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,480
announcements i mean

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,320
in the latest plasma announcement we

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,520
emphasize we always give the

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,880
announcement

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,000
some kind of topic

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,960
uh this year this this last one there

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
wasn't much

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
visual stuff we could latch on to much

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
visual

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,880
um many visual features we could latch

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,880
onto so we decided to go with the

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,360
stability usability flexibility

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,720
which is of the abstract which is

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,559
something that you can't

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:12,320
uh usually see but it is something that

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,559
users could appreciate and so we made

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,799
the topic stability usability and

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799
flexibility if we look

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,000
at what people talked about in their

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,440
blogs and in

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,400
uh news sites etc right

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,919
we have okay the this is one got it half

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,120
right performance

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,240
usability this one said

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,440
stability it's on economy

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,840
so that is stability and usability mass

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,039
fiat

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,000
installing so stability so

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,000
we somehow

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,840
yes sorry something

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,840
okay there's this weird sound okay there

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,960
was um

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,200
somehow a bit of you know that famous

00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,200
um

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,159
reality distortion field where you say

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,679
something

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,640
and somehow everybody just believes it

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
not that we lie

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,159
or anything like that but we choose

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,159
a topic we put it and people

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,840
repeat it as if it were their own ideas

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,840
if they had

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,120
review reviewed it and found it to be

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:37,840
exactly what we said which well

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,000
it is true that that uh plasma 5.32

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,240
it has improved stability usability

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
flexibility it is also true that

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,600
most new versions of plasma improve

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,840
those things but

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,840
anyway probably

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
uh

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
the the

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,080
oh 15 minutes only probably the most

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,080
important thing we do

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,039
for you is we help you

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,880
define uh clear goals for uh every

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
promotional activity often when you come

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,640
in

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:15,840
you come up with an idea and

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,960
uh we like say you want to

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,039
promote your blog post and we

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,240
ask why or what do you want to achieve

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,159
a lot of people find this a bit

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
off-putting because

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,240
it should be obvious i want to promote

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
my blog post because i want more people

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
to

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,279
to visit my blog okay

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,039
but what is the ultimate aim

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,600
of that uh just promoting your blog post

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,000
is not

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,520
the cannot be the end game you must want

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,240
something else something that will

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,720
benefit your project for example you may

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,840
want

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,960
to promote a blog post that uh

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,360
that invites people to help you develop

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,440
your application you're inviting people

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,960
to participate in development or you

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
want to promote your blog post because

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,120
you want people

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
to download your your uh application

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,640
more

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,240
and use it etc that is

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,799
an end game goal

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,279
and we often we often uh try to help

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,279
with that

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,400
so by

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,520
applying what we call a baseline where

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
we

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,919
take the thing you are trying to promote

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,120
and find out

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,159
how it makes somebody's life or the

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,200
the the people you want to reach lives

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:44,960
better so for example if

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,279
it's uh somebody using your

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
your application it will improve their

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,720
life somehow for example if we're

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,919
talking about canadian life

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,919
well the new version has more features

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,080
and it will help you subtitle your

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
videos in a much better way and you'll

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,840
be able to produce your videos

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,840
in several different languages much

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,720
faster without so much hassle

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,840
so we find out uh the thing which is

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,200
your product

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,320
and uh what thing it improves and for

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,840
who

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,039
right and that helps us to make

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,919
your um

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:26,480
product reach a wider audience because

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,039
it is easier to understand for the

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
readers or the listeners or whatever

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,240
why they should use it the other thing

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,840
we do

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
and this now with this i'm going to

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,640
finish

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,880
is that oh the two things

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
we look into we also look into external

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
events

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,080
the uh where we can take your products

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
and show them off

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,480
like we have taken uh uh gcompre

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,600
to educa webb in brussels and show it to

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,960
teachers

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,520
we have taken plasma mobile to

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,880
open expo in madrid and showed it to

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,720
prospective

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,840
developers and companies

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,799
that develop mobile applications and

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,600
things like that

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
in the hope that somebody will sign up

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,799
and

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,919
you know actually do something with that

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,440
and

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,760
finally we actually go out

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,600
and help organize grass grassroots

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,760
communities of kd supporters

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,960
in places where maybe the efforts were a

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,679
bit disparate

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,960
and this is what the network program is

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,480
about which

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,480
anika is going to explain

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,159
um

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,039
well i think my voice okay thank you so

potential and you need support

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,760

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,559
often what ends up happening

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,159
is that we give people the information

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,760
and the tools they need

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,120
to carry out most of their promotion

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,799
themselves

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,240
uh but of course we also uh offer them

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,960
the stuff like the access to the kd

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,640
community

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,679
um official um

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,640
or more official general uh

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,760
social media platforms so stuff that

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,279
they

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,919
they want to promote they can promote on

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,799
there et cetera you can email email

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,320
us either of us don't use the mailing

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,880
list because that is normally for

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,799
external

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,159
organizations that want to contact with

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,720
kind of like

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,120
the people who who respond to press

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,279
questions and stuff like that

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,240
i mean you could it's not a problem it's

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,880
just that

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,520
we don't normally uh uh receive a

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
request

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
through there the best way is the matrix

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,399
kde

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,039
uh promo uh group uh where

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,799
anik and i usually are hanging out there

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,000
most of the time

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,320
so i think that's it

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,360
yes so if there are any questions i

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,320
don't know how

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,120
we're doing time-wise we have seven

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,720
minutes

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:19,530
oh some minutes good yeah

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,809
okay so in regards to those questions

00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,809
[Music]

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,919
we have

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,279
one so far

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,840
so this is from hala we've seen that

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,279
the biggest engagement driver for krita

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,640
was youtube

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,200
by about 60 of incoming hits

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,640
so we decided to find someone to make a

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,360
youtube channel

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:56,799
is that an idea for the kde as a whole

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,799
we do have a youtube channel and we

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,320
we do have a youtube channel and it's

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,480
there are several people who manage it

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,000
the the problem is of course creating

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,679
content creating videos

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,240
is a long slog it's very very long

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:17,679
and uh uh and complicated and

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,240
so we don't update uh we don't

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,960
upload as much we want we would we want

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,840
to

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,039
um nicolo is doing a very good job at

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,519
the moment

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,640
and we aggregate stuff from his channel

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,960
into

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,200
uh playlists on on the youtube channel

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,720
on the kd youtube channel we also had a

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,000
peer tube channel

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,279
which was nice

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,640
but as you know instances are normally

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,440
are often uh hosted by individuals

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,320
and uh in instance we were using

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
disappeared

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,880
so we're looking for a new peer tube

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,279
channel uh

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,799
that we can replicate our youtube stuff

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,399
stuff into pictures so we don't have

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,799
much problem you know

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,519
everything that we have on on youtube we

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,240
can

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,880
jump into peer tube too which in itself

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,480
is

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
is complicated because we have many

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,080
years of videos lots of

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
lots of gigabytes of videos and not

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,080
every instance

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:19,039
will take us so yes

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,360
it is definitely a very good thing hala

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,120
uh

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,799
i think it's a very very savvy move and

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,360
we are trying to keep up with that

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,200
i would like to add it also depends on

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,159
your audience for example for peter

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,480
mostly people

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,320
are interested in tutorials so the

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,399
audience over there

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,519
needs videos right but for maybe kd

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,440
because we are covering

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,880
so many software so we don't have one

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
dedicated audience for it

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,399
so maybe a lot of your audience gets

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
distributed for kde

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,399
so some of them just want social media

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,480
maybe just facebook twitter master dawn

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,799
or some of them just want youtube so for

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,919
k uh for if you compare krita and kd

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,919
you will never have the same

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,559
thank you very much for the answers no

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,919
other

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,399
questions came in in the meantime so

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,639
thank you very much for the presentation

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,480
both of you

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,560
and we'll be seeing each other during

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,839
the event i guess

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,839
