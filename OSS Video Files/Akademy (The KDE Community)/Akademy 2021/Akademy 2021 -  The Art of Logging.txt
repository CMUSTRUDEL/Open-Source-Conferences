Proper logging is essential for every software developer. When doing this in a sane way you will be rewarded with easy to understand warnings and errors that allow you to track down many bugs without even having to start a debugger.
But this is not everything! Doing logging right allows sysadmins to analyze why certain features of a system are not working. And also for the embedded world, they are the probably most important way to understand, what is going on on your smartphone when it is not doing what you want.
In this talk I want to cover the following topics:
* How does the Qt logging framework work? How to reasonable create logging categories and choose the right severity? And how to change log levels of your applications?
* How do modern logging backends work? Specifically, I want to look into systemd's journald backend and explain how to use it to analyze full system logs and filter them for your application.
* At the last section, I will explain how one can access and analyze logs via remote access. In particular this can be done with embedded devices like Plasma Mobile smartphones.
