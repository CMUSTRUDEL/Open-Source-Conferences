[Music]

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,920
okay

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,639
i see you are here i see your camera i

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,639

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
see your slides already here so that's

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,880
good uh

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
just give me a thumbs up up or down how

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,880
do you

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,880
feel about academy so far

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,760
yeah that's what i thought and uh

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
well how do you feel about the schedule

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,239
uh

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,879
looking forward for today

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,280
yeah would couldn't say better myself

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,160
guy

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
okay we still have a mentor so before we

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,559
go

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,559
um

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
i think we are settled here so i think

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,280
i'll just

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:13,840
vanish now and let you do

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:13,840
all the talking

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,119
can you hear me now okay yeah i think

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
this has happened to every one of you

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
before

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,320
so you've came to the right talk this is

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
plasma work from home edition where i'm

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
going to show you a bunch of

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
features and tips and tricks how you can

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
use plasma to make working from home and

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,240
online conferencing

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
more fun and more productive so of

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
course

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,520
i have to start with notifications you

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,520
know plasma has this do not disturb

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
feature for a while now which disables

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
pop-ups and notification sounds so

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,719
you're not distracted

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,759
except for like critical notifications

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
like your um

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
computer's on fire or the battery is

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
about to run out

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,439
so we've had that since 516 you can save

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
for one hour for four hours until the

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
next morning and so on and so forth

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,599
it was supposed to be configurable what

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
next morning means because not everyone

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,800
gets up at the same time

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
unfortunately this hasn't been

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
implemented so i think it's like six a.m

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
in the morning

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,280
the next day or something there's also a

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
global shortcut that you can set

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
so you can whenever your boss is

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,560
sneaking behind you you can just hit on

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,440
a button and then disable notifications

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,959
and there's also a middle click icon um

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
you can middle click on the icon to

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
top it do not disturb mode at any time

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
but

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
what about screen sharing like it's

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
tedious if you have to go into the

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
notification icon and then disable it

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
for one hour and maybe you forget and so

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
it's

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,720
like this is not ideal right so

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
there's an indie big debuff api on the

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,319
notification service where

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
you can set and request or query the

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,239
inhibition state

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
so an application might want to disable

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,879
notifications when you're giving a

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,720
presentation or i

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
know that for example telegram disables

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,360
its custom notification sounds when

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,000
plasma donor disturb mode is enabled and

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,159
also k alarm i think hides its um

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
custom notification pop up so kudos for

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,680
that and then i made a little project

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,519
called obs fdo notifications dnd so it's

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
open broadcasting

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
service free desktop notifications do

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,519
not disturb

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
which is a little plugin for obs studio

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,000
to do exactly that when you start

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
recording it

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,319
um in terms of notifications it was a

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,640
little side project to

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,120
just learn like libdiva c and like all

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,640
of these low level things without cute

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,000
but can we do better yes

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,519
so what about we flag a recording tools

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
window for example sometimes you get

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,319
this recording

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
control swing where you have your

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,080
microphone or you have this pop-up which

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
has your sharing your screen

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,200
how about you have a window rule you can

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
say okay well

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
whenever this window is up i want

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,319
notifications of or maybe i can use

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,519
screen scripting

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,280
and then do some elaborate x property

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
heuristic to find out when someone's

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
sharing the screen or whatever but

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,799
you know that's not not really nice

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
right so

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,080
of course the answer is wayland will fix

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,239
it because um

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
on weyland an application has to go

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,040
through the xdg desktop portal to share

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,639
the screen

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,759
which means we know when that happens

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,240
and as a matter of fact in plasma 522

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,919
whenever you share your screen at a desk

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
remote desktop notifications are

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,280
automatically disabled

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
so you don't have to think about it and

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
of course at any at any moment you can

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
click on the notification icon to turn

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
notifications back on

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
of course you can disable this

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,040
automatism if you don't like it

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
but the next big topic about remote work

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
and online conferencing of course is the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
volume applet

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
because a big part of conferencing is

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
headsets microphones and speakers

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,639
so there's been lots of work going on in

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
this direction

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
so you're probably all familiar with the

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
plasma volume applet there's a lot of

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,400
things going on here

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
so let's just break it down new features

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
are

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,479
through the power of david we added some

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360
live volume meters so if you go on the

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,160
notification

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
and on the plasma volume applet you see

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
the live

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
volume peak of your speaker and

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
microphone it works both on the device

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
and the applications tab

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
so you can actually see that your

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
microphone is like

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,199
at full blast or the application can't

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
hear you because it's too low or

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,440
anything like that and then also there's

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
now some device disambiguation if you

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
hover over the

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,680
application and if there's multiple

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
devices

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
then it actually shows you which device

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
the application is using

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
and then something that i've been

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,479
working on right now which is not yet

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,800
merged

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,120
is an indicator that if the device the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
application is using is muted right now

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
so it can't hear you not because the

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
application is muted but because the

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,759
device is muted

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,360
there will be an indicator to show you

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
about that so you don't actually have to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
leave the applications tab you just stay

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,759
on

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,199
you just stay on the applications tab

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,639
and then you can see it right away

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
i haven't figured out a good way to

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,919
present this yet in a way that the user

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
can understand it so that's why it's not

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,039
in it

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,560
and also here is a corked indicator

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,479
which is suppose audio speak for

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
pause not playing so whenever an

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
application has a stream but isn't

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,919
actually playing anything

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,639
then it shows a little icon so you can

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,919
spot that right away

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,560
yeah the microphone indicator

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,000
was originally added as part of the kd

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,680
privacy sprint goal as the kind of

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,199
privacy feature so you can see when your

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,639
microphone is being used

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,160
but it turned out really useful for

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
doing online conferencing because you

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
can

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,280
click it to toggle mute and then now it

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
also shows again which device is being

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
used so if

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
whatever confronting application happens

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
to use the wrong microphone

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,039
you can see that right away and then fix

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
that

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,400
and then of course there's the never

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,960
ending story running gag

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
vapor award situation about the push to

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,479
talk feature

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,720
i actually bought myself a little usb

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
footprint so i can feel like a bus

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
driver when i'm in the conference on my

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,639
computer and then

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,680
operate my microphone this way i started

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,360
this

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
i think on our first ever online sprint

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
last year but uh the original

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
implementation was a bit poor then i

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
wanted to make it proper with like a

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
clean plugin using

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,599
the modifier only shortcuts thing so you

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,680
can press and hold

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,400
a single specific button like right

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,240
control key or only like one of them

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
without uh grabbing the key from the

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
application but

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,599
and then i got distracted and so on so

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,560
forth so i have it in use on my desktop

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,560
pc but

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
the code is not yet anywhere so help

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,120
would be appreciated and for folk i

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
i thought this clicky thingy so yeah it

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,919
will happen sometime but

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,599
don't quote me on that right and then as

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,520
a closing food for thought

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,240
i have some suggestions and ideas for

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,080
our lovely queen developers

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
because you know we have this screen

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
thing which is this amazing

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,919
railing compositor and window manager

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
and it has so many built-in features

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,199
that are right there which

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
would be so helpful for online

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319
conferencing

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,360
if there were like the last five percent

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
of ux polish uh going on so for example

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
did you know that quinn has a mouse

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
click effect it's in desktop effect

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
setting and you have to enable it and

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
use some key combination to toggle it on

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
or off and then whenever you click you

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,599
get this

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,199
loop effect on clicking how about we

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,879
turn it on automatically when you do

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,639
screen sharing so people can easily

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
follow what you're doing or maybe

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,919
we need some screen share plasma thingy

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,199
where you can easily toggle those

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
switches on and off

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
how about a magnifying glass again quinn

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
has a magnifying

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,840
looking glass effect but turning it on

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
and off is a bit cumbersome so why not

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,080
if you hold down this button it always

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,399
shows up or maybe laser pointer or

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,159
highlighter feature so you can easily

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
show people what you're looking at this

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,839
screen and maybe we can

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,680
put some annotation drawing thing in

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,680
there as well like maybe we can just put

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
spectacles annotation editor in queen or

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,760
something like that but

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,640
um yeah or what about opening new

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,040
windows on

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,880
the non-shared screen so that you never

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
accidentally leak information because i

00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
think

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
every one of you has seen that when

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,160
people accidentally

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
tap around it and suddenly you expose

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,720
your email client to 200 people watching

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,959
or something

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
for example maybe we could flag a window

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
as confidential and then your email

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
client or your chat window will never be

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,240
rendered out

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,080
through this pipe buyer video feed even

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
if you share your full desktop because i

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
personally i always share my entire

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,640
screen

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
i don't share individual windows because

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,160
i find it cumbersome when you

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
want to switch to something else to show

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
something else and then with full

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
desktop you can just move it around

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,959
so yeah i think that's um something that

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
would be really really appreciated in

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,600
queen and

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,240
yeah let's see if if we can get that

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,880
done so if there's any more ideas you

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
have for

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
what would make your life easier when

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,519
you're stuck at home then feel free to

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,080
leave a comment on this

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,080
fabricator task and yeah thanks for your

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,680
