Publication date: 2021-06-29

Description: 
	By Carl Schwan
This short talk will be focused on an analysis of various projects inside KDE using their git histories. It is some sort of continuation of this blog post: https://carlschwan.eu/2021/04/29/health-of-the-kde-community/, but with more plots and data. More importantly, I want to take a step back and look at the lessons we learned along the way and how we can help our community to grow more in the future.
