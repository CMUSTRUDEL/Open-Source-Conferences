Title: Akademy2021 - How we can Solve the Personal Data Problem
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By BjÃ¶rn Balazs
Data collaboratives, trusts, cooperatives and many more have for long been discussed as a cure for the current problems with personal data. None of them so far succeeded in practice. I think, we can change this.
In my talk, I will provide a vision for a system, that is trustworthy, democratic, transparent and that guarantees digital privacy for each and everyone, while providing fair access to personal data for those interested. I will show that a 'global digital personal data cooperative' can be realized and what we in KDE can do for it right now.
Compared to a traditional cooperative, this is facing some special challenges, such as:
* Personal data is immaterial
* The data is extremely sensible
* The problem to be solved is global
* There is an existing market, where we can individually trade our data for 'free' services
* How we want to handle personal data differs per person and will change over time
I will show how we as KDE, free software communities and civil society can deal with these challenges and just start hacking the system right away.
We can actually change the world. We can make it securely private again, without loosing the comfort of big data.
This is a big vision and this is my first step into general public. Thanks for joining despite.

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,160
hello

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,600
welcome and thanks for joining me on my

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,960
talk about the solution

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,119
to the personal data problem

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
i'm really excited about this talk for

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,720
two reasons

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,800
first of all it's been really a long

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
time since i last talked to you here at

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
academy

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
and for those who don't know me my name

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,600
is bjorn

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
i work at kdub as a project manager and

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
ux guy

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,200
but i also have a history in free

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,480
software

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,879
it all started shortly after 2000

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
when i helped to initiate the open

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,719
usability

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,840
initiative i was also involved in

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
creating the visual design group within

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,039
kde

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,359
and my last contribution was the k user

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,960
feedback

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,720
which i happily see all around kde

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,240
by now on the other hand

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,799
i've always been a data activist so

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,479
i try to avoid producing personal data

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,200
as much as i can

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,680
you know next to running linux i you

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
know i've

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,240
de-googled android

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,439
i run my own cloud or better next cloud

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
you know i

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,479
wha whatever i i try a lot to avoid

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,200
producing personal data

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,280
so as you can see there are two hearts

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
beating in my breast

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
on the one hand side i need to know

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
everything about the users

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,720
to be able as a ux guide to optimize

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
services

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
products and so on on the other hand i

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,920
know

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,799
the danger about the danger producing

00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,479
personal data brings

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,079
and the second reason i'm really

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,399
excited about this talk is

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,840
this is the first time i'm talking

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,959
publicly

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,360
about what i think is a solution to this

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,080
problem

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
so let's take a look at what you can

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,599
expect

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:26,640
from this talk

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,480
first of all i'm going to explain to you

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,519
what a personal data cooperative

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,360
is how it can look like because

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,440
i spoiled this in the abstract this is

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
the solution to the problem

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,239
but more interesting than that even more

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
interesting than that

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,160
i will explain to you why i think

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,080
that if it's done the right way it will

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,280
actually change the world to what a

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,800
private world

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,319
where we can still benefit

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,519
from you know the comfort and

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,040
and the services big data analysis

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,720
based on our personal data brings

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,239
and last but not least i will explain to

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,560
you

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,680
how and why we

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
as civil society you know as free

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,120
software

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,040
and skde specifically

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,959
why we are the ones who can start it

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,080
we don't have to wait for anybody else

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,560
we can just

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,720
hack the current system and start it and

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
change the world to a better place

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,120
i'm deeply convinced about this and i

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,000
hope to i truly hope

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,599
that at the end of my talk some of you

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,200
are convinced as well or

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:49,280
at least as curious or curious enough

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,120
to join me um refining the ideas

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
what i'm going to present to you as a

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,599
blueprint it's not a detailed concept

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
but it is it is the fundamental

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,040
idea behind it and i hope you'll

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,799
understand

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,040
and get it and i hope that you will

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,879
agree at the end even though i know

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,000
you're probably very critical because i

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,080
know about the

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
discussions about collecting private

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,160
data within kde

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,359
but i still hope that i can convince a

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,519
couple of you

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:25,120
to help me take this further

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,199
so obviously we need to start

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
with a fundamental question if i want to

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,919
propose a solution to the personal data

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,000
problem

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,560
the fundamental question is is there a

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
problem with personal data

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
and the answer is yes there is a problem

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
with personal data

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,800
a huge problem with personal data and

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
i really don't want to pitch you about

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,360
this too much because

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,680
i think we can spend our time here much

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,720
better but still

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,680
i want to bring your attention

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
to a couple of aspects of the personal

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,639
data

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,639
problem so first of all

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,400
why am i talking to a free software

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
community about this

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,120
because i think free software is falling

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
behind

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,600
because we constantly say no to

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,440
producing or using

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,759
personal data our proprietary

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,880
competitors they collect and create

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
personal data

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,400
at large and they improve the usability

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,600
the user experience of their products

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,639
and this is something we're not doing

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,000
and by this the quality of our

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:44,080
products will fall behind and behind

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,080
and behind so using free software

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
will become more and more a matter of

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
belief

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,280
you know of thinking of doing the right

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,120
thing

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,160
rather than using the better product

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,520
there are exceptions definitely but

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,039
at large we can't compete

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
with the quality of proprietary software

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
of

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,600
you know software that engineers the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,880
user

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,880
and the user experience into

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
into the products itself we're trying

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,199
our best but

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
the key to success really is personal

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
data

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
a second aspect i want to bring your

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,520
attention to

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,479
is innovation today often

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,520
isn't about creating great algorithms

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:39,520
innovation today often

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,720
is based on the availability of personal

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
data

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,199
think for example about

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,639
predicting traffic jams it is

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
really really simple you just have to

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
know okay there are a lot of people on

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
the street

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
you know and they are not moving at the

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,280
pace they should be

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
moving so traffic jam yeah so if we want

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
to

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,520
you know help people with a good rooting

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,360
algorithm we wouldn't need to know that

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,039
there is a traffic jam but

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
this is something if we don't have the

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,039
data

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,880
we will not be able to create

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,919
such a service so these two points

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,880
together

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:26,080
mean that i think that our reluctance to

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,280
um create personal data and use personal

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,960
data

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
will actually lead to the situation

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,319
where we as free software become more

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
and more irrelevant and this is

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
something which is

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,160
utterly wrong for society we need free

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
software we need free services

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
and we need something as simple as a

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
free traffic jam

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
warning thing on

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,840
so but there it goes even further

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,120
yeah if we think think of those

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
who actually own own the personal data

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
right now

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
you know it's a very few companies that

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
know

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
a real lot about us think about those

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,840
companies

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,639
those companies are also those who

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
actually have

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,319
most of our attention span

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,960
so when you i don't know if you've seen

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,680
the cambridge analytica

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,400
documentation on netflix but if you see

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,319
how

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
knowledge about the personal data can

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,520
help to influence

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,039
elections even you know even the u.s

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,440
presidential uh presidential election

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
um has been influenced or the brexit

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,320
yeah

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,479
if you see this then

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,440
imagine how hard it will be to regulate

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,640
those companies when we actually reach a

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,560
point

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
where where this is necessary to do

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,720
and the last thing which

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,240
i want to mention here sort of pitching

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,080
you about the problem

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,760
break personal data brings

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
the last thing i want to pitch you about

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,440
is

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,279
i think i am trying to avoid producing

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,560
personal data

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,760
i'm trying i i guess you're doing

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,519
a lot of you are doing just the same but

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,560
still we have to suffer

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
from the effects

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,000
that personal that the misuse of

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,040
personal data brings

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,320
you know trump has been elected

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,600
the uk you know has left

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,720
the eu

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,600
even though we do all we can

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,920
to avoid producing personal data and

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
that

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,120
is because the current approach is

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,720
a kind of an elite thinking

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,279
we are thinking well you know

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,399
go ahead and you there are alternatives

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,800
use them

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:07,040
but we don't see that you have to be

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,279
really really competent you need to have

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,800
a lot of time and willingness

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,600
to be able to not produce data

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,440
giving you one example i've been working

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,880
on a home automation system

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
for my little flat i have

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,760
i've been spending i don't know 500 600

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,839
700 hours into setting up

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:37,200
a home assistant to you know

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:41,360
work within my flat and it still doesn't

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,839
fully um i i don't think we can expect a

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,200
lot of people to do that

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:51,200
so the the problem we have is

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,560
really a usability problem yeah

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,600
people at large will not

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,120
and will never ever you know

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,880
spend the time needed to live

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,399
a life without producing personal data

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,680
and as long as we don't get the

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,760
large majority of people to actually

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,079
be sensitive with the personal data they

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,560
produce

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,720
as long as this doesn't happen we'll

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,120
have ruthless people around

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,959
that will take advantage of the personal

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,760
data that is being around

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,040
again take a look at the cambridge

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,160
documentation

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,320
and see how elections have been

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,839
influenced based on personal data

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,120
so i think enough has been said

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,279
about personal data the conclusion

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,399
personal data is often called the new

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,600
oil

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,760
the problem we have is that we as

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
individuals what can we do with our

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,800
little share of oil

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
well currently the only thing we can do

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,800
is

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,480
we can trade it for a couple of shiny

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,240
digital marbles and that's what we're

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,880
giving it away for

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
and i've spoiled it before the solution

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,959
to this problem

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:18,399
is creating a cooperative

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,240
a cooperative is well it's a concept

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,040
that's been around for

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
you know thousands of years basically

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,839
since we started

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,240
living in tribes we are cooperating yeah

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
so

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
you could call a tribe sort of the the

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,360
starting point the first cooperative

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,720
there was in the world and so a

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,160
cooperative

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,959
basically is about a bunch of people

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,480
that have the same interests yeah and

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,639
that work together

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,000
against sort of you know an enlarger

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,079
enemy yeah which they couldn't you know

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,920
they couldn't face individually so they

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,560
they collectively do this

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,600
yeah and the goals we have i think the

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,160
goals we share

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
are we want to have and live a private

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,320
life

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,440
but at the same time we want to

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,399
benefit from the new services you know

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
that that are based upon our collective

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
personal data

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,920
because they just make our lives much

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,160
much greater

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,800
yeah go back to the traffic jam it is

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,880
good that you can predict traffic jams

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
and that you can take a detour which

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,120
takes you to your

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,200
to your um destination much faster

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,959
um than sort of going through the

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,959
traffic jam but for this

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:40,160
we need the kind of data think about

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:45,040
the covet pandemic

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:48,079
yeah if if we had a trustable um

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,760
you know point to put our data together

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:55,199
you know all the apps that that are

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,399
working well not so good right now

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,440
could have been much much

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,760
more effective in you know

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
steering our contacts and you know

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,000
warning people about oh well you you

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,399
could could have been infected and you

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,600
know go on karentine and stuff like this

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,079
but there there is there is no no one we

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
would

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,440
trust our data right now yeah but this

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,079
would be something a cooperative would

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
actually you know solve if we would have

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,720
some place to put our data

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,079
um then it would be easy to do the

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
necessary

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,959
calculations based on this data

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,440
so you might ask

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,800
why can't i join a personal data

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,079
collective

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,000
cooperative right now and

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
to be honest i don't know it's been a

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,079
theoretical concept and if you

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
if you search literature and the web

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,600
you'll find

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,480
tons and tons and tons of uh material

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,639
about it

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,120
and you know almost everyone is saying

00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,320
well the solution is a cooperative

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,000
but there is still none

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,720
you can join so perhaps to understand

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,839
the problem a bit better

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,959
let's compare the personal data

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,000
cooperative with a traditional

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,480
cooperative a traditional cooperative

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,279
could be

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,399
something like you know a couple of

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,320
farmers

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,680
that want to that together want to

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,360
sell the milk they produce

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,279
yeah so the first thing is the milk the

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,480
farmers produce

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,920
once it gets sold you know somebody

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,000
drinks it or you know

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,240
bacteria do their work at some point

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,600
it's gone i know some frenchmen might

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
disagree on this

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,160
but you know and it will be gone at some

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,560
point in time

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,639
but personal data is an intangible good

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,880
just the opposite is happening here

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,720
yeah so when you when you sell it it's

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
still there it doesn't vanish

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
yeah it's that you can copy it and you

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,279
have an x

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,560
and an exact duplicate of it and you can

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,000
you know resell it

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,399
you know people can do whatever they

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,759
want so we can't we cannot give it away

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,160
like we can give milk away

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,920
the second aspect that's different is if

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,079
you think about the farmers

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
yeah they have to live within a within a

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,320
small area because they you know they

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,399
have to

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,880
carry their milk to a central point but

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,120
with personal data everyone on the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,720
planet is a potential

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,720
member of this cooperative

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,839
last if you spill a litter of milk

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,320
you wipe it away and everything is okay

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,680
but if you spill personal data

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,360
this is a catastrophe for a person

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,639
and potentially even for society

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,639
so we have to have an enormous amount of

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,000
trust into the system

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,279
to you know to to

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,799
be willing to join it so when we design

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,839
the system

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,919
we have to put trust in the first place

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,640
we have to optimize the system for trust

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,640
and three things for me stand out there

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,039
the first thing is

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,079
protection has to be the foremost goal

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,480
of this system

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,520
we have to protect our personal data by

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
all means

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,320
there can't be any compromises

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,880
protection is the thing the the thing we

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,640
have to

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,520
go after the second thing is

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,280
transparency you we will only trust the

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,120
whole thing if it's transparent

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,919
and we as free software community we

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,720
know our way around with transparency

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
but this goes way beyond software of

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
course

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
all software we will use will have to be

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,559
free software

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
but this will go way beyond this the

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,760
whole organization

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,039
will have to be transparent to the bone

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,200
it has to be transparent that it hurts

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,200
and the third aspect which is

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,640
actually pretty natural if you think

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,799
about a cooperation

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
because obviously it says everybody has

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
to be has to have one vote within this

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
corporation

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,320
yeah but we have to really think about

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,240
it because it has to be a worldwide

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,200
corporation still everybody

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
has to be able to participate in this

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,400
i've created a mission statement let it

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,720
let me um read it out so

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,120
our mission is to create the most

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,480
trusted organization in the world

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,679
it will protect our digital privacy

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,720
while enabling innovation based on our

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,120
collective

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:53,120
personal data and i totally

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,160
i'm totally earnest with the

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,039
with the idea of creating the most

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,720
trusted organization in the world

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,559
you know this organization handles

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,679
our most sensitive data

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,919
and so this is what affects us most

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,960
yeah this is this tells everything about

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
us

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,000
so we really need to have an enormous

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,840
amount of trust

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,520
into this organization but

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,039
let me explain how a

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,240
solution can look like or how such a

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,720
data cooperative will look like and i'll

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,280
go

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,240
through this step by step so if we want

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,120
to collectively

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,039
you know collect our data and there

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
needs to be a technical solution to it

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,360
so

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,880
we as consumers would contribute our

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
data into a

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,360
technical solution um so this means

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,559
there has to be you know some

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,880
some input mechanism um there has to be

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,039
a

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
storage of the data i'll call it a data

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,960
pool

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,520
and um there has to be the possibility

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,880
to do

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,360
evaluations based on the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,039
data in the data pool and we should

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,159
strictly follow the

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,120
open algorithm approach of the mit

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,880
which says we should not move the data

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,360
to the algorithms instead

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
the algorithms have to move to the data

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,320
and this is because data is an

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,520
intangible good as we've

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,679
seen before and it can be copied

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,799
um but if there is a technical solution

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,799
we will need to have somebody

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,159
who's actually running the technical

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,720
solution so we

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,640
should create a for-profit company that

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,240
runs this technical solution and that

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,400
actually earns their money

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,760
by creating a marketplace

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,360
of evaluations of anonymized evaluations

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,720
based on the

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,200
data on our data pool but

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,200
as we have seen with freenode for

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,400
example for a while

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,880
creating a for-profit can be problematic

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
so what we actually need is we need

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
somebody

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
or something to own this for-profit

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
company

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,760
which you know cannot be changed so we

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,480
need some sort of a foundation with a

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
clear goal

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,640
that owns the for-profit company and

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,960
that actually you know

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
gets the money and you know spends it

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,039
again

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,919
into projects

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,720
that follow the statues of the

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
foundation

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,080
and i think this needs to be foremost

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,559
this needs to be

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,159
research about how we can make the

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,280
technical solution better

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,559
because i totally agree the current

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,840
situation probably is not sufficient

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,159
to run such a data pool probably we need

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,960
to

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
do more research to create a technical

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,480
solution that

00:21:52,159 --> 00:22:00,080
protects our data enough to

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,039
to be trustworthy yeah but uh other

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,159
other things that need to be um financed

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,200
by the foundation

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:11,360
is educating users it is

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:15,919
free software for example so

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,120
um as i said before we also need

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,320
as users and as consumers to influence

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
what's been done

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,559
and for this we'll need some form of a

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,159
parliament

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,840
yeah this parliament the job of the

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
parliament is actually

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
mainly to control the for-profit and to

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,039
set the rules for the

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,039
for-profit so

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:43,280
basically the parliament um is

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,720
our way to influence our view

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,760
on what privacy means to us because this

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,760
is not you know this is not set in stone

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
privacy is a concept that will change

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
over time there will be new challenges

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,760
to it and we have to react to this

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,440
so the parliament next to sort of

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
defining priorities on how the money

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,919
should be spent

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,679
is mainly for controlling the for-profit

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,600
it will set the rules

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,280
for the marketplace yeah the for-profit

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,679
will run a marketplace but it

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,799
cannot be allowed to do anything to sell

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
any data

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,000
and foremost the parliament has to

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,760
actually maintain the technical solution

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,520
if this is open source think of the

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
parliament of being the maintainer

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,600
that says which you know which pull

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,720
requests are accepted which

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,960
are not and by this

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,039
the parliament can control which data

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,240
goes in in the first place

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,520
and which evaluations are allowed

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,120
upon our data in the last

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,320
are finally allowed on top of our data

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,880
so the parliament really is to has to be

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,919
the

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,559
product owner of the of the technical

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,520
solution and the for-profit can only use

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,039
what the parliament allows but if

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,480
there's a parliament

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,600
we also need elections and this as i

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,720
said before is a

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,240
very difficult issue because consumers

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,640
are placed all over the world so

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,080
my idea here would be to establish a

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,200
chain of trust because

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,679
trust is what we're really aiming for

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,360
so the idea is that consumers that

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,360
contribute the data to the technical

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,960
solution they can also vote

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,080
for an ngo they really really trust

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,200
this can be the kdev or

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,600
the fsf or fsfe but it can also be you

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,159
know

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
greenpeace or you know red cross or red

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,559
half moon or

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,559
you know whatever ngo you think is

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,240
doing a good job and it's really

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,640
trustworthy and the top

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,799
ngos that has been that has have been

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,039
voted for

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,919
they each send an expert into the

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,720
parliament

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,200
by this we don't have a direct democracy

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,520
but an

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,480
indirect voting system but still

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,679
consumers

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,840
are able to influence um what's been

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,360
done in the parliament

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,080
so this is the main system but there is

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
still

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,279
one little ingredient missing to make

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,960
this

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,880
a success and this is

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,799
a seal the seal

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,000
that is being defined by the parliament

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,880
and it gets awarded from the for profit

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,240
company

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:32,799
to product developers

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,799
that comply with the rules

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,200
why is the seal so important

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,039
because i truly believe

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,120
that giving people consumers

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,799
at the point of sale or at the point of

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,320
consumption because we are

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,279
also want to avoid what this cl2 free

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,159
software

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,679
but giving them a real choice by

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,679
informing them about

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,080
the situation will actually change the

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,760
world and it has in the past

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,760
because look at the ecological movement

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,840
nowadays in the supermarket you can buy

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
an apple or you can buy an ecological

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,799
apple

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
and you have you know you you are

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,240
informed you can make an

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,919
informed decision and we need to do just

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,720
the same so if you want to install an

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,640
email client

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,799
you need to be able to choose between an

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,919
email client and an ecological email

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,200
client or

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,200
privacy aware email client and it needs

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,279
to be clear at the point of sale and i

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,120
need to say okay this costs delta money

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,880
more than the normal email client but

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,640
i'm willing to pay this because i'm not

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,640
willing to pay with my personal data to

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,320
this

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,279
so that was the idea of why i think

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,240
the whole thing will fly in the end the

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,320
question is

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,679
how do we lift off and well the first

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,080
step is we need to talk about it this is

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,200
what i've been doing right now

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,480
and the goal of this obviously is to win

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,679
people that join me and help to sharpen

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,880
the ideas

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,640
and you know have to you know create

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:15,360
uh content and and to to make this

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:20,240
become real but

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,399
the same it is as important

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,000
even though if you might not be

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,799
convinced yourself

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,960
i'll ask you to take the discussion into

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,279
your community not only in kde

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,600
but also into your product community

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,679
because we need to find

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,760
um we need to find free software

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,200
projects that are actually willing

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,640
to take the risk to move on to step two

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,600
with us

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,000
and step two is actually once we have

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,080
sort of discussed the idea further

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,080
and and found a couple of free software

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,080
projects we together have to

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,080
establish a temporary organization like

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,880
an ev

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,000
the goal of this ev is basically to

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,760
create some funding

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,279
and to you know finalize

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,480
the concepts yeah but the main goal of

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,080
this

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,200
is to create a proof of concept

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:19,200
for the

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,279
involve free software projects so

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,399
together we need to create a solution

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,880
where our users can

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,840
opt in and say yeah i'm willing to spend

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,399
my data

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:33,840
and a solution that fulfills our

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,960
privacy demands

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,600
because i think we have the

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,360
highest level um

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,399
on this you know of of integrity

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,640
of the system and only if we

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,399
if we can fulfill it for ourselves we

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,720
can be successful

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,600
but if we manage to create such a proof

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,679
of concept

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,200
that works for our free software

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,880
projects we are ready

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,440
to move on to step three and step three

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,760
means

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
that we have to incorporate the final

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,840
organization

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
we have to establish the initial

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,720
parliament

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,039
and then we have to create the

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,799
visibility by establishing the seal

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,320
if we have a couple of free software

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,039
projects that

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,399
are willing to join us here yeah they

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,080
will be awarded with

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:30,960
this privacy seal

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:34,399
and this seal will

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,559
create a visibility for the topic

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,000
and with this whole package we can then

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,919
go

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,080
to you know commercial

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,559
and proprietary um software developers

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,279
because what we now have to offer is a

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,919
service

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,440
they are willing to buy our service

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,120
means that we

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,120
take care of the gdpr issues for them

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,360
they don't have to care because they if

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,840
they use our system they won't even have

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
access to personal data anymore they

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,000
will just have access to

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,600
evaluations based on that so they can

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,600
sort of you know

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,520
drastically um decrease the effort they

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,640
they have to undertake to to be

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,840
compliant with

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,679
gdpr and other legacy other

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,480
laws also

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
the seal is a matter of trust you know

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,640
it's it's

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,520
it transports trust so if

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,240
a product gets the seal they can

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,640
ultimately

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,640
you know raise a higher price because it

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,200
is a more trustworthy product

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
so again this is something product

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,520
developers will be willing

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,840
to pay and the last reason is that they

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
are

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,520
that they get the opportunity to

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,840
actually do the right thing

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,200
and not just keep on piling the data

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,679
they produce

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,399
yeah on the data piles of a few big

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
companies

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,640
that already know a lot about us so

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,200
i think that the right starting point

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,919
for this

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,399
is free software we within free software

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,120
we can

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,159
create everything we need and then we

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,200
can ex

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,320
expand the system towards commercial

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,360
software

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,000
and by this we will allow people in the

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,480
long term

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,559
to take informed decision at the point

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,039
of sale at the point of consumption

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,760
and this will change the world and there

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,480
is a plan

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:35,360
how we can get there so summing it up

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:38,960
we can solve the personal data problem

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,320
i hope i can find a couple of you guys

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,760
to help me bring this further it is a

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,120
blueprint

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,320
a lot of concepts you've seen right here

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,360
have been just superficiously

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,519
been been described yeah

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
i'm i hope we still have some time for

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,519
questions

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,519
so i'm happy to explain concepts

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,440
that interest you much further because

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,519
there are thoughts going further

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,200
if you want to read about it i have

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,000
created a web page

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,799
it's called private.org you can also

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,480
reach me via

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,440
via bjorn at private.org

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,559
or visit the buff i've scheduled for

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,159
tuesday

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,679
at 10 utc so again

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,880
thanks for your attention and hopefully

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,559
your interest and i'm happy to answer

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,559
your questions right now

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:44,880
thank you i hope you can see me

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:48,080
okay thanks uh we will have our speaker

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,039
online in a few seconds so but anyway

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,120
for now thank you for for that it was

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,919
really a lot to think about

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,120
we even have already we have questions

00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,120
we have a lot of questions

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
actually so i'm not sure now we will be

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,760
able to answer all of them but

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,600
let's try okay

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,600
so i can see you

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,720
can you but hello does it work

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,080
yes it does so sorry sorry again for

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,159
this being a recording

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,399
i really would have loved to do this

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,399
live

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,159
okay but i think it was good in the end

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,399
i mean very very very

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,399
good so and the feedback from the shot

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,760
was on the same

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,200
line so um so let's start with the

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,679
questions because we don't have

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,320
a lot of time and we are going to use

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,120
the score

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,720
so i see a bottle of score there so from

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,039
cornelius the first question is

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,440
what examples what kind of data do you

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,240
see where companies will buy data from

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,440
such a

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,399
cooperative um i think

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,600
that's that's potentially a lot of data

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,279
let me give you an example

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,720
if you i mean cornelius you're asking

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,679
this you're working for a transport

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,760
agency

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,880
uh or transport i don't know agency is

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,440
not the right word it's

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
uh whatever for the ban you you work so

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,240
if you sell a ticket for example yeah

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,159
then then you collect personal data

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,919
yeah and this data can go into our

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,480
database now you

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,639
you this data belongs to me as i've been

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,399
buying the ticket and to you

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,879
as you've been sort of the ones that

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,320
produce the data so now but

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,480
you you want to keep this data

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,280
exclusively for yourself in the first

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,280
place but you might be interested to

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,480
share this for example for research with

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,040
other institutes

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
yeah so they can do research on your

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,240
actual data

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,440
so that would be the idea of creating a

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,639
marketplace in

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,399
very few words but i mean the the the

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,159
kind of data is really

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,919
we have to discuss what goes in and what

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,839
doesn't yeah but

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,839
um it can potentially be a lot

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,960
okay okay the next question is from alex

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,320
which is

00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,480
well short but very very big uh how

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
theoretical do you think this is

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,760
i think this is absolutely practical

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,040
it's a matter of wanting

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,800
wanting to do it yeah i mean i'm i i

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,839
can't do it myself i'm psychologist you

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
know i work as

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,119
a project manager i can't program

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
anything i'm not a

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,400
law expert you know i'm not an expert on

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,440
any of the specific topics except

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,640
perhaps on the usability side um which i

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,000
would like to answer

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,040
um nuno's question as well uh within one

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,640
go he asked about the sort of what does

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,560
it mean for the user

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,920
and i think that's the that's exactly

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,400
the the important thing

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,480
the user has a single point you know the

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,000
user needs to have a dashboard where he

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,560
or she can just say okay

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,560
i want my data to be shared with you

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,440
know free software i do want free

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,680
software to be

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,680
to to be able to access it but i don't

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,440
want i don't know big tech you know or i

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,839
i don't want you know

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,480
anyone dealing with weapons to access my

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,200
data

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
so the user actually gets a single point

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,280
where he can

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,320
control all the data and define

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,880
where that data should go to so for the

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,599
user the user experience is extremely

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
improved

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,440
by now or today you would have to you

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,079
know go through thousands of apps and

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,560
you know

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,560
individually state yes i want to share

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,280
this kind of data and i mean you totally

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,400
lose overview there so i think it's very

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,000
important

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,680
that i think it's an absolutely

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,680
practical idea

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,920
um i mean there are a lot of pitfalls

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,320
and a lot of research to be done yeah i

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
think

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,560
our database structure isn't good enough

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,680
right now to you know cope with

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,000
what we're asking for um but

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,200
yeah it will be it will change the thing

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,280
for the user as well

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:46,320
will make it much easier okay

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,480
um another question is from

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,720
tr uh which has a higher score so

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,079
how will it be protected from abuse

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,920
inside from inside

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,119
but agents inside the company or from

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,040
accidental leaks

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,640
would it be integrated into the way

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,800
private data is handled inside the

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,000
company

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,960
um i i can't tell you exactly how this

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,079
has been done but

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,359
we have to we have to create a structure

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,800
um that that makes it very very hard for

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,359
leaks i mean obviously we're always

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,520
humans

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,280
there will be leaks yeah i mean i could

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,520
you can't promise anything else

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,040
but um i think an important role here is

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,440
again the parliament i sub

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,440
i i propose because it really takes the

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,079
instance of controlling the for-profit

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,920
company

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,240
where the for-profit company by itself

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,599
cannot be transparent yeah because you

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,440
know it has to

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,920
protect certain things yeah you cannot

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,000
put your passwords

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,440
out there yeah this would be not you

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,440
know that would be not helpful

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,599
but exactly there the parliament steps

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,079
in and has to actually check that

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,359
beyond the scenes that are public anyway

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
everything is okay

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,880
and this is why we have to create a

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,400
chain of trust into this parliament we

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,040
have to trust that the people

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,599
sitting in the parliament are actually

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,960
sort of

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,960
you know working on our behalf we as

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,640
you know contributors to the data are

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,520
the shareholders of this business so

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,680
this business

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,839
has to work for us that is the whole

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,880
idea

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,200
okay there is another more

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,280
check questions about the competition so

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,599
how can this highly regulated for-profit

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,520
data vendor compete with huge company

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,599
collecting selling all the data that

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,359
they can get nearly unregulated

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,200
or even financed by intelligence

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,119
organizations

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,880
um i think the the the lever for this is

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,520
actually that we start within free

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
software

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,760
we just offer an alternative we don't

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,079
force anyone we don't force users into

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,000
this

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,079
and we don't force companies into this

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,320
but from my professional experience

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,240
i know that not a lot of companies are

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,079
actually interested in my data

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,160
they're interested in our data because

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,839
they want to know how their users behave

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,200
they don't want to know what bjorn does

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,280
they're simply not interested

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,640
so they do have an in they they do have

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,200
an interest

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,119
in joining us we are we have an offer

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,240
that is good for them not only

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,040
um on the gdpr thing but also the this

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,920
label

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,640
will you know it will transport trust

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,359
onto those

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,800
organizations that have it it will work

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,920
just like

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,200
just like the organic apple yeah the

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,640
organic movement

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,839
is successful because the users have a

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,000
choice

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,520
and that is exactly sort of the

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,079
mechanism working here and

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,160
companies will just join because it's

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,560
the better choice for them than to live

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,200
than to deliver the data to some of the

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,640
big companies

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,359
okay i'm not sure we have time for

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,640
another

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,800
question let me i can start reading it

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
we have like two questions left in case

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,880
we're not going to have it then

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
uh you can always we can always discuss

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,400

questions and i could only

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,599
sort of you know go through it on a

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,319
pretty shallow level their thoughts to a

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,839
lot of things
