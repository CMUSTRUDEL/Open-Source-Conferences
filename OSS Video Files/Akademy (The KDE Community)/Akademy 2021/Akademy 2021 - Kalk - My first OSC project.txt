Kalk is a cross-platform calculator application with a focus on ease of use and simplicity. It is built over the Kirigami Framework. I have implemented a new binary calculator feature as well as ported to an infinite precision number system.

This talk briefs about the work I had done during the Season of KDE on Kalk.
