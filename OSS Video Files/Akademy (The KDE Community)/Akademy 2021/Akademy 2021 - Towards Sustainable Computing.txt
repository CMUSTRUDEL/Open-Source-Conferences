Description: 
	By Cornelius Schumacher
The way how we use computers has an impact on our environment. It has ecological, societal, and economic consequences. These consequences can be destructive, be it climate change or undermining people's autonomy. How can we move towards a sustainable way of using computers? How can we keep our planet and our society in a shape which provides healthy and desirable living conditions for us and future generations? We have answers. In this presentation we will discuss how KDE can contribute, and give an overview about two projects in this area, the FOSS Energy Efficiency Project, and the Blue Angel ecolabel.
The goal of the FOSS Energy Efficient Project (FEEP) is to make measuring energy consumption an integral part of our development process. Collecting data is the base for understanding and optimizing energy efficiency. We will discuss how measurements can be done, including the scientific research behind it and how it's done in practice, and have a look at measurements for Okular, KMail and Krita.
Energy efficiency measurements are one part of the criteria for the Blue Angel ecolabel. The Blue Angel is a successful label with a long tradition in many different product areas, issued by the German government. It recently has been extended to cover software as well, using criteria for energy efficiency as well as for user autonomy. We will discuss the current effort to get KDE applications certified with the label, and how we can scale that within our community and beyond.
The topic of sustainable computing becomes more and more important. Free and Open Source Software is uniquely positioned to make a siginificant contribution here. We have a strong background in KDE through our values and our technolofy. We have a great chance to make tangible achievements. Let's do this together in the KDE way.

[Music]

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
okay

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
looks like everything's set go ahead

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,199
have fun

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
yeah thanks and welcome to this talk

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
about

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
sustainable computing my name is

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,640
cornelius i've been

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
around for a while and this is a topic

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
which actually is

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,160
dear to my heart because it's it covers

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
a combination of different things it

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,239
covers

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,399
why i'm in kde for a good part because

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,840
of idealistic reasons

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
but also because of technical technical

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,760
challenges

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
interesting solving interesting

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,280
technical problems um

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,920
and also covering uh this this idea that

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
um yeah we can do more with the

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
community

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,960
than we can do alone and sustainability

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,239
is something

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,359
which is i'm using the term here in a

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,559
pretty broad

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
sense how do we use

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
resources we have how do we satisfy our

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
needs

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
in a way that future generations can

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,880
still

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,200
fulfill their needs as well and how can

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,920
we get there in the context of computing

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
and how

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,040
kde can help to get there that's what i

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,759
want to

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,439
talk about in the next 30 or 40 minutes

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,360
we have talked about that last year at

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,920
academy in a more informal way

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,799
we had a buff session about this topic

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,400
and

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
i will now give you an update what has

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,840
happened so far where we are today

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
and what we are going to do in the

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,280
future

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
so sustainable computing why are we

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,280
talking about that

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,640
but what is that if we look at

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,240
what computers do to our environment

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,719
how we how they impact our life and also

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,680
how they

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,960
impact our future ability to have the

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,000
same life

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,719
we have to look at different aspects one

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,560
is

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,440
energy consumptions so obviously

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,560
computers use a lot of electricity

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,680
and these are two graphs from

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,000
from a scientific study about

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
electric electricity usage of

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,160
communication technology

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
so this in the study the communication

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,239
technologies this broad range of

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,520
computers speed servers be it

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
desktop systems speed phones and this is

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
a

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
prediction how much the impact will be

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,239
of

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,760
electricity usage in the future so this

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,440
goes to the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,160
towards the year 2030 and there's a

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,720
they call it worst case scenario that

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,879
okay

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,440
that electricity usage of computing

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,720
technology could go up to something like

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
50 percent of the global electricity

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
usage

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
which which is an enormous amount of

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,920
energy

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,280
so there are different scenarios of

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
course this is about predicting the

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
future that's not

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,480
that's not always easy um and there are

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,760
different scenarios in a

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,319
best case scenario um if we do the right

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
things

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,239
then we actually might end up with a

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
situation where

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,640
we don't use much more electricity

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,319
as a fraction of total electricity

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,319
electricity usage

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,840
in the future but there's clearly a

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,159
broad range

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,599
and for the expected case scenario

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,680
that's something

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,959
on the right graph you see that in

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,840
absolute terms

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
that's a huge growth expected so this is

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
something which

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:44,159
will affect um of course um yeah

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,640
our yeah the amount of electricity

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,640
we use the amount of energy we use and

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
what computers have an effect

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,319
so what that means is not that easy to

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,760
say

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,799
um i mean we can say that using

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
huge usage of electricity of energy in

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,760
general

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
that's something which will affect our

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,799
environment in some way

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
um of course depending on

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,000
from which sources this electricity

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,040
comes it has a different kind of impact

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
it comes from sustainable renewable

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
energy sources

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,000
then the impact on our climate is

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
probably lower than when it comes from

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,160
other resources and so it's not easy to

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,840
tell what exact effect has

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,919
this has unless we have real numbers

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,240
but what we can say is that it will have

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,440
an effect that there will be

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,680
an increase of usage

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,919
because computers are everywhere we know

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,800
that we're using them every day

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,520
everybody's using them and we need to do

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
something to

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,800
keep that under control so this is the

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,240
energy aspect there's another aspect

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,880
if we look at the electronics we use

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
um this is a picture it's a nice

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,960
sculpture actually

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,280
on an art artist project the wii man

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,039
so the waste which comes from electronic

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,080
and electrical

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,360
equipment and this this

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,199
wee man is a seven meter high sculpture

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,240
um built from 3.3 tons of

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,600
waste electric electronic waste

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,160
and that's about the um yeah the waste

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
uh one person produces in this case in

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
the uk so

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,960
these are the numbers and and you see

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,560
that that's a lot of waste

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,479
which is produced there and this

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
obviously has an impact on on the

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,080
environment and

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
so the question there also is what what

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
can we do or what what does it mean to

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,800
produce

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,800
so much waste and the third aspect i

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,199
want to look at is

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
it's more focused on software that's the

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
question how much control do we actually

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
have when we use software what what

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,880
impact does

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,919
um software has on how how we live our

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
life

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,360
and one of the typical examples there is

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
you if

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240
you look at printers um if you want to

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,319
print a piece of paper that

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
supposedly is a pretty simple thing you

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,080
just do it and you have a driver which

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,639
converts your data into

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,759
inks ink on paper but if you use

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
software for that

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
you might end up with something which is

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
quite complicated and you get a lot of

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,039
functionality you might not

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,639
even need and you might not care about

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,280
the facts functionality

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
you might not want the integrated shop

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,800
to buy a new ink

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,400
and this is also an example where

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,520
software is really controlling

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,880
um the the use of the hardware so even

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
if you have a good printer

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
um the software controls um if you can

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
use it with the ink you bought for it

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
and

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
um also when it will stop you working

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,599
with

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,319
um with the ink you have board

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,039
so this is an example for yeah control

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,560
about

00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,240
soft and how you can control your

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,560
your usage of computers in a way

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,599
that you can do it in a sustainable way

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
so the question is can we do something

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,960
about this

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
how can we fix some of the problems

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,840
maybe

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,800
and this is if we are looking at this

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,199
from a very

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,479
high level and a very global point of

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
view so there are the

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,160
sustainable development goals of the

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,960
united nations

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,039
they have defined these 17 goals which

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,520
cover all kind of areas

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,280
and there are a couple of areas which

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,039
are interesting

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,880
also in our context if we are looking at

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,520
computing and software and hardware and

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
so on

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
so this obviously has something to do

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,319
with consumption

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,039
with energy also with um

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,000
yeah other aspects of society so this is

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,120
the very high level

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,599
um but we we can go a little bit further

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
down

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,879
and look at it in a more concrete way

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
and the question

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
is um what's the role of software there

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,160
so

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
we are talking here in the kde community

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,199
obviously we are a software community

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
so how can we um approach this

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,639
question and one one thing which has to

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
be said is that

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,840
hotline software can't really be

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,759
separated i mean computers don't work

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,039
without software software can't

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
work without hardware so these affect

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,160
each other

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,520
and the architecture and the design of

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,560
our software

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,680
has an influence it determines how the

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,039
hardware is used and

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,520
also how much resources are used and it

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,640
determines um at least indirectly the

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,479
energy consumption

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
it's not the only influence obviously i

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,760
mean also the efficiency of the hardware

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,760
itself plays a role

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,440
but the warehouse software is written as

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
an influence there

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
and if we look at the question of

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,560
electronic waste

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,160
then we also have this big effect of

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,399
software that

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,560
you might need new hardware not because

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,000
your hardware is broken or outdated or

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,480
not good enough anymore

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,120
but because your software requires new

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
hardware

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,000
because it might use more resources than

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,399
before or it

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
might use new features which weren't

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,240
there before

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
so we have this effect that hardware

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,680
often becomes

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
obsolete uh because of the software it

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
runs on it

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,600
and then also the question um a lot of

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,440
restrictions are actually not hardware

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
restrictions anymore about software

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
restrictions

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,240
so the way how you use hardware and also

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,480
how long you can use hardware

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,360
it's not defined by really the

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
the life of the hardware itself so you

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,839
rarely use a computer until it's really

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,560
broken um often you replace it for

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,240
other reasons because of software

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,800
restrictions or software requirements

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,920
so if we look at that we can say

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,880
software matters

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,279
a lot in terms of the effect on

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,560
sustainability in general and concrete

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,519
questions like resource and energy usage

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,519
and it also matters how software is done

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,480
so it's not only about what software to

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
use but also

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
how the software is applied and how the

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,360
software has developed and in which

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
direction software has developed

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
so then obviously in kde it's not enough

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
to just

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,399
recognize the problem we ask the

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
question what can we actually do about

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
this

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
is there a way how how we can have an

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
effect here and

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
contribute something to to better

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,320
solutions

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,440
and if we look at kde's vision which

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
says

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
we strive for a world in which everyone

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,720
has control over their digital life

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,279
enjoys freedom and privacy this control

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
over

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
our digital life that that's something

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,839
which i think

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,160
resonates quite well with the idea of

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,640
sustainability

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,560
so there's a lot in there and i will

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,519
unfold that a little bit and show you in

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,200
the next

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,440
couple of slides as well um how this has

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
an

00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,079
even more concrete application in in

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,760
this area

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,839
also one thing we can say that kde

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,720
technology actually is quite efficient

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,360
um it's in the domain we are we are

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,640
writing mostly desktop applications

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,959
um at least that's our origin

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,720
we we write them as native applications

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,120
the technology we use with

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,360
c plus plus and q uh that's technology

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,680
which usually is quite quite efficient

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
so there are some studies for example

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,440
about

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,640
resource efficiency of programming

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,440
languages

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,000
and c plus as you can see here comes up

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
at the top with a pretty good

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
factor and there are other languages

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,720
like if you look at

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,399
more modern languages which are also now

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,079
often used on the desktop for example

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,880
javascript for example

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
other languages python perlis uh one one

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,200
of the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
on the last places here they they use

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
inherently

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,680
more energy just because of the way how

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,360
how they are that doesn't mean that this

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,440
is really an exact measure and there are

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200
certainly also ways how to

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
write efficient code in in many

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,639
languages but we can say that

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,279
in kde our technology um the

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,040
the tendencies that that we actually can

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,680
be quite efficient and that it's

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
not that difficult to uh to write

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
efficient software

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,120
and we have linux as an open and

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,240
efficient platform

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,760
i mean we know that linux has been

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,160
around for a long time and one

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,480
really also of the good and also

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,040
prominent use cases often is

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
and was in the past if you think of

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,240
install fest and stuff like that

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,160
to get linux running on old hardware to

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
make it available for example for people

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
who can't afford new hardware

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,680
or just to make use of computers you

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,279
already have so you don't have to buy a

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,959
new one because

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,480
other software would require you to

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,880
upgrade to

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,680
bigger hardware faster with more memory

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,120
and everything

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,880
so kd is in a good position um there and

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
yeah the other aspect where i think kde

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,720
can have quite an effect there is

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,320
because it provides leverage we have

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
many applications um

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,680
we have many different use cases we have

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,320
many users

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,279
um if we look at for example what

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
presented

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
this this morning about the it's all

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
about the

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,839
applications all about the apps so we

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
have a lot of users and even the users

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,040
we know that that's already

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,760
quite a number and there's certainly a

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,920
lot of users we don't even know about

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,959
and if we think of the the role we have

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,279
there

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,680
if we improve our applications in a way

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,959
that they save a little bit of energy

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,240
or make usage of resources in a more

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
efficient way

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
this might have a small effect if you

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,920
look at just one application but if you

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,480
look at many applications and multiply

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,480
this by the number of users they have

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,079
this can have a huge effect and that

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
doesn't mean that it's sufficient to

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,079
solve all the energy problems

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,880
but it's one one of the things which can

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,880
contribute here

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,720
so um given that we assume

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,440
we can do something about this how do we

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,600
do it

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,880
how can we actually make a difference

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,279
here

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
and i want to present you three projects

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,279
in this area

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
which um yeah we have been working on um

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
for

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,279
quite some while um already in

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
the concept stage also in a little bit

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,240
of implementation

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,680
and the last project is something which

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
will

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,519
is being prepared that will start in the

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,360
future and these are two areas

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,880
the first one is the force energy

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
efficiency project

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,760
with a nice acronym feed this is about

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,839
measuring measuring actually

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,880
energy efficiency so we have data we can

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,120
quantify

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,600
what we use there and where we can

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,680
change things to improve the situation

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
the second one is the blue angel label

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,199
you might also have heard about that

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,639
this is the certification which

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,440
demonstrates

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,880
that your software actually is done in a

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
sustainable way

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,560
and i will tell you more about what it

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
is and how it works

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
and the last one is the blue angel for

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,760
free and open source software that's

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
that's a new project

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,680
about more about the community part

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,160
about spreading the word about engaging

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,199
others about helping others to

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,560
also be more sustainable in their

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:26,480
in the way how they do their computing

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,600
so let's dive in the first project is

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,440
feed what what is it what's the goal

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
there

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
what we want to achieve there is that we

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,880
want to quantify

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,839
energy efficiency so it's easy to say

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,399
okay this

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,800
application appears to consume a lot of

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,759
energy i mean sometimes it's obvious if

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,399
the fan of your laptop starts to to make

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,680
noise

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,959
that's an indication that energy is used

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,000
but what actually uses the energy and

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
also how you can

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,279
maybe affect it and change it that's

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
something which is um

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,440
you're not so easy to answer if you

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,600
don't have numbers you can rely on

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
so for for that we need to measure this

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
and we also

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,079
need to measure it in a way which is

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,199
repeatable so that we can actually do

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
comparison

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,959
um that we can also

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,440
watch that over time or with different

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,320
implementations different versions

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,320
and if we make this transparent then it

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,800
can actually become a criteria

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
we can use for other purposes to tell

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,519
what is sustainable what is

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,600
uh what is energy efficient uh maybe

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,720
features what is energy energy efficient

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,120
architecture what is

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,880
energy efficient design um and there

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,680
still is a lot to do in this area so

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,839
it's not not

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,240
not clear what what the answer is there

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,560
but we have to start somewhere i think

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,600
and one important part of that also is

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,199
that we need to develop the tools or use

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
the tools which are already there

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,360
and so that we can do that automatically

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,480
and it's something which can

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,959
become a part of our normal development

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,279
environment and we can use it as

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,839
criteria for

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
how good our software is in the end

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,679
i want to present one method

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,559
how this can be done so this is a

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
procedure

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,679
which was developed as a research

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,919
project from from the unitria in germany

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,520
it's about sustainable software design

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,319
and they designed

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,400
a measurement framework which can be

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,959
used to measure the energy consumption

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,679
of

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
software it's not that easy actually

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
because

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,600
there are a lot of different parts

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
involved so

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,960
this is the first step towards that

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
which

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,799
is aimed at desktop software desktop

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,559
software because there you have one

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,880
computer and you can actually measure

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,760
the energy consumption of this computer

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,200
and if you don't have dependencies on

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
for example servers or other

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,559
components then this is a good measure

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,840
of what

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,120
specific software is using and the way

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,840
how this is done is

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,720
they they pro they define a scenario

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,480
where you

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,520
measure software in different scenarios

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,679
so you create a baseline measurement

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,919
over time so this is the line which

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,880
basically the computer uses when

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,520
when it's simply on without any software

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
running

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,039
or not the specific software which we

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,440
are looking at

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
and then there's a second measurement

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,120
that's

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,760
the the second line here that's the idle

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,240
manager

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,520
idle measurement so when you start a

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,080
piece of software and

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
it does nothing it will consume some

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,360
resources

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,400
it will consume some energy but if

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,720
there's no activity

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
this will be pretty constant and then

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,440
the interesting part

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,600
is using a standard

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
scenario what you typically do with a

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
piece of software and then measure how

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
the

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
energy consumption develops over time

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,720
and you see this in this curve

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,720
where yeah according to different

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
activities then different

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
amount of energy is used and you can

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,640
actually measure that

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,160
by observing how much power the computer

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,880
actually is consuming

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,799
if you put the device basically at the

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,240
power adapter of the computer

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,120
and you can get pretty

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
hard numbers about the consumption and

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,280
you do that over time

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,360
you do that over you do that a couple of

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,480
times to to create averages

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,240
and collect some other system statistics

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,520
like memory usage

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,520
processor utilization hard disk activity

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,600
network activity stuff like that so so

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,000
that you can also put that in context

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
to then tell what actually is happening

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
there

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,000
yeah and if you collect all this data

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,440
you can create reports which

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,760
um summarize this also here

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,600
there are some something like an average

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,280
energy consumption or a total energy

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,080
consumption if you integrate over this

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,280
curve

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,440
you get numbers you can then use

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,280
for comparison and also for transparency

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,360
so this is a procedure which was defined

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,679
in this research project

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
and we actually have some measurements

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,720
of kde software

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,360
using this method

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,440
these were done by students at the

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,320
umbrella campus bettenfeld so that's

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,520
the institute at the university of tria

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
where also the

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
this measurement method was developed

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,280
and um

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,000
yeah i think fully these students have

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,159
done some measurements on kde software

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,840
um so i will show some graphs how this

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,360
can look like and this is only one graph

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,799
um this this is the

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,240
actual energy consumption and so how

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,880
much power

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,559
the application is consuming in the in

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,640
the standard usage scenario

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,760
and this example is oculus so you can

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,000
see over time

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,200
there's a standard scenario where you

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,480
open a file

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,559
you put this file into presentation mode

00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,080
use go forward a couple of pages

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,720
you invert the view you zoom out

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,799
you zoom in change some pages again

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,799
invert the view again and you can tell

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,159
um in the graph what is happening here

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,960
so these

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,080
bigger spikes these are the view

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
inversions

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
uh the the smaller spikes this is when

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,600
you

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,440
go over different pages so you can tell

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,919
what is happening there and you get an

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,000
overall number about how much energy is

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,360
such a usage scenario

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,360
then consumed

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,679
a similar measurement for another

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,120
application camel

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,799
also done by another student at ombud

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,159
campus

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,320
this is another usage scenario

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,440
in the context of k-mail so opening some

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,159
mail folders um composing sending mails

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,440
replying to three males so these are the

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,679
bigger peaks here

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
so opening these males typing something

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,200
and then sending it out over the network

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,280
that actually consumes apparently

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,039
quite a bit of energy i mean the

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,120
absolute numbers are still quite low of

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,880
course because this this is one male

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,400
but by repeating this measurement a

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
couple of times you get this average

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,200
where you can actually tell okay

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,480
these actions consume this

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,440
amount of energy and of course there are

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
more graphs

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,559
which collect the different

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,679
yeah also resource futures

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,039
resource utilization scenarios and you

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
will see here

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,919
that for example the energy consumption

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,039
correlates quite well with the processor

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,320
utilization and you can see that

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,840
if a mail is sent then there's a

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,840
spike in network traffic

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,919
so krita is another example also

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,440
a use case where you look at different

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,559
operations in krita

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,200
editing pictures and you can see for

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,799
example

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,240
there's a big peak at the beginning

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,159
where you open the picture and then

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,159
there's some operations done

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,200
drawing operations which don't consume

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,120
as much energy

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,600
and then there are some group operations

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,039
which consume more energy

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,880
so if you look in detail at these

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,360
scenarios and the measurements you

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,480
you can actually tell which actions and

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,320
have which effect

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,200
and again you get this number you can

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
use for comparison

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,960
so and then another measurement um i'm

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,799
sorry the attribution is not correct so

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
this also was done by francisco who did

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,400
the

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,919
ocular measurements um this is a a

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,799
little bit newer measurement where she

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,200
compares

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,679
um not a single application but

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,760
different operating systems and has a

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,080
more global usage scenario with

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,159
downloading applications installing them

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,960
copying files around and so on

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,000
and this is a comparison between linux

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,600
and windows

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,960
so it's interesting to see it's it's

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
quite similar but there are some

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
differences in some cases linux is

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
better in some cases windows is better

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,559
so

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,960
this would be interesting to look uh

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,440
more into it and i also have to say that

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
this is

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,000
an ubuntu system so it's not a kde

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
desktop so that also would be a nice

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
research project to look into that and

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,880
see if there's a difference if maybe

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,080
plasma is more effective than

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,320
the gnome desktop on ubuntu

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,360
so these are a couple of examples how

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,760
you can do

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:25,440
these measurements and one question um

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,840
i want to ask in the context of this

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,840
force energy efficiency project is what

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,600
what if these measurements could be part

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,080
of our usual operation so what

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,760
what if we could integrate them in how

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,240
we do software development

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,320
and we could create another metric we

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,720
use i mean we have metrics like we we

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
make sure that our tests pass we look at

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,480
bug counts we look at

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,080
translation statistics and so on so why

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,080
not also look at energy

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,840
consumption statistics and make sure

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,000
that our energy efficient

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,520
doesn't uh degrade over time and new

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,159
versions consume

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,559
too much energy compared compared to

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,600
older versions so we could

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,120
maybe make this quality gate and

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,120
i think it would be a nice motivation

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,080
also for optimization so getting

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,760
some of the peaks smaller maybe getting

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,000
the absolute numbers smaller

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,320
if you measure them then you have a good

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,640
way how to also optimize them

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,600
and making this data transparent to

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,720
users

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,039
would make it very easy for us to

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,880
yeah also talk about that and give users

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
a choice what software to use and have

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,000
good arguments to use

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
the software which is sufficient

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
so this is a technical part about really

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,279
looking into the data

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,039
and making sure that we have

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,480
the other ways how do you how to measure

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,679
and decide about that

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
now i want to talk a little bit about

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,120
the brute angel which comes from from a

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,279
different direction

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:56,000
um the

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,400
german people will know the blue angel

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,880
it's

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,880
actually something an echo label from

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,960
the federal government of germany

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,440
it's it's really old it's more than 40

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,400
years old and it was

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,400
created to

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,559
indicate products which are designed in

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,440
a way which

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,200
is uh friendly for the environment and

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,159
in germany you see that label on a lot

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,159
of different products

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,640
obviously for 40 years ago computers

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,440
were not such a hot topic as they are

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
today

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,120
so this this is about stuff like paint

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,799
uh but also

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,600
completely different things like like

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,480
ships so a very broad range of products

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,279
and

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,640
the the label there there are criteria

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,760
for each product

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,720
category what it means to

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,640
be environmentally friendly and then

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,960
according to these criteria

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,559
you can get the label to indicate that

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,520
your product is

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,760
done in a way which uh fosters uh

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,760
sustainable consumption

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,679
so you can read about that it's a german

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,760
label but all the documentation it's

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,720
also there in english and

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,799
the criteria i think are quite general

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,320
valid so it just makes a lot of sense to

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,559
look at that not only from a german

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,600
point of view

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,919
and last year they introduced

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,679
a category for resource and energy

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,120
efficient software so this is a new

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,799
category

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,520
that's a great presentation actually

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,159
given by marina kern and iva kern

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,919
they they were instrumental to

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,039
establishing this

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
category for software and under the blue

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
label

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,360
and i recommend to watch this

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,480
presentation it's it's

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,000
uh it really gives a good background and

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,320
details about that

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,159
and while it's in german there's an

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,960
english translation available so

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
it should be accessible to everybody the

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
focus of this

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,039
criteria is desktop applications um

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,120
server and mobile will be added in the

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,279
future but for now

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,200
there has to be a start somewhere it's

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,760
about desktop applications

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,799
and the criteria are categorized in

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,320
three areas

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,480
the first is resource and energy

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,080
efficiency the second is potential

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,039
hardware operating life

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,480
and the third one is user autonomy and i

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
will tell you a little bit more about

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,159
what that

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,080
actually means so if we look into

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,120
resource and energy efficiency

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,279
they use for these blue angel

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,880
criteria for the brain certification

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,679
actually this mythology

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,880
i presented before about the sustainable

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,799
software design

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,080
and so part of the application for the

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,279
granger label

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,840
is to provide measurements

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
according to this procedure and the data

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,279
which is related to that

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,440
you have to document that put it into

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,960
standard format so it can actually maybe

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,919
actually be made transparent and

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,720
this is the energy efficiency part the

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
other part

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,640
is about the potential hardware

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,880
operating life so making sure that

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
you don't have to yeah buy new hardware

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,399
because uh

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,480
your software requires that so part of

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,559
the criteria is that

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,399
the energy consumption of new versions

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,279
of your software

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,039
shouldn't increase over time so a new

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,799
version that there's actually a limit so

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,520
it can increase a little bit but

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,480
um it's it's not supposed to increase a

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,799
lot

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,080
so this makes sure that on old hardware

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,320
you can actually run

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,120
um your software for for a long time

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,679
and part of that is the definition of a

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,440
reference system so they have specs for

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,440
systems from 2015 to 2019

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,039
and so so these are reference systems

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,320
you can use to do measurements to make

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,559
sure that you have

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
this

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
yeah that that you have it in uh

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,720
available on all systems as well

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,320
so one of these systems could look like

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,799
this this is one of the reference

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,760
systems from 2015

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,080
and yeah we can do measurements of this

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,679
and

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,200
our software runs very very fine on it

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,799
user autonomy is an interesting part

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,399
because that's not so much about the

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,159
technical specifications but

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,080
more about making sure that users have

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,559
control that the data formats

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,159
allow interoperation that the software

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,399
is transparent

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,480
that it's available for for a longer

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,559
time that you are in control of what you

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,799
install and what not

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,720
that it's free from advertising and

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,279
stuff like that so so this is something

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,679
i think

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,720
which is very familiar to us this is

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,039
basically

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,880
a lot of the ideas of free and open

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,320
source software reflected in this

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,279
user autonomy criteria so if you look

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,960
very close

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:45,120
you can see that actually these criteria

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,120
there's a hole shaped in the form of kde

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,360
kde fits in very well we're desktop

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,799
software we have this

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,640
software autonomy user autonomy as

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,360
something which is in the core of what

00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,000
we are doing so this is something which

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,440
fits very well to us kde software

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,279
qualifies for that in

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,320
a direct way and

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,039
there is demand for this um so this is

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,919
this is

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,440
a blog about um a decision by the city

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,679
of dortmund which

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,360
they recently did they said for for new

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,559
software they will actually

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,000
require that it fulfills the criteria of

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,399
the blue angel for software

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
so if they buy new software they look

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,480
for that

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,279
if there is software there which is has

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,360
this label

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,320
and that's one of the problems we have

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,640
at the moment nothing is there yet

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,240
so but kde software could be there i

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
said this this is

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,279
really a good match so where are we with

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,200
with

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,799
with this this is something i've worked

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,279
on for for the last

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,039
couple of weeks and months to get our

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,559
applications in shape there so the

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,320
application looks like this

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,600
they're different you have to fill some

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,600
forms you have to

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,039
put in the documentation you have to do

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
the energy managements

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,720
so based on the energy measurements done

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,640
by the students

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,159
in trial i created the first set of

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,399
applications here

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,880
the one for ocular is almost ready

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,039
kaimei and krita are next

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,039
we have the data for that and we are

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,480
looking into measuring k develop kate

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,000
other kde software i mean there are many

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,600
applications

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,120
and we have a little bit of tooling and

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,519
infrastructure available to help with

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,679
that

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,880
and with kdev we have an organization

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,159
which can actually

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,960
officially do the applications for that

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,960
so we are almost there with that here's

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,320
a workboard in a repository you can look

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,600
at the link

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,600
what's what's happening there

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,760
so can we do something about this and we

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,720
make more sustainable computing possible

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,840
with kde

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,240
we can with kde if we can shape of a bit

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,240
of energy multiplied by all users

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
or if we can spread it amongst our

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,080
applications if we can make the idea

00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,279
stick we can actually make a difference

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,279
there and this brings me to another

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,399
project that's the last of the three the

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,399
blue angel for force

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,760
can we do something about this if we

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,880
look at kde yes

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,880
i think i've shown we we can but the

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,480
good thing is we are not alone

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
there are others who are also supporting

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
this course and we're actually starting

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,720
with a project

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,080
supported by a grant of the german

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,640
environment agency starting in july now

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,240
to support sustainable development

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,080
software development by promotion and

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,559
application of the criteria of the blue

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,919
angel

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,000
in the free and open source software

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,320
community so this is about spreading the

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,960
word and helping others to also do that

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,720
and getting a community going to work

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,480
towards these criteria to work towards

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,760
more sustainable computing

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,519
and we're in contact there with other

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,760
organizations the fsfe

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,720
the roundtable repair or the document

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,240
foundation

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
they all have interests in there and

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
obviously there are many more

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,039
communities which would fit in there

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,000
there are more desktop applications

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,360
which could

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,480
benefit from actually the qualification

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,760
of uh yeah energy consumption but also

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,799
these other

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,039
criteria about user autonomy and similar

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,039
things

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,919
so let's do something about this um i

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
think we have the means we we have a

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,919
very good situation

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,440
um we we have the right projects we have

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,399
the right people to do something about

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,000
this

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,919
so let's work towards sustainable

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,320
computing and

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,240
let's carry the flag for sustainable

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,159
computing i think kde ev

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,200
and kde in general we have a lot of

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,879
very good resources there and we have

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,320
i think the opportunity to make a

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,119
difference there

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,359
um and to do yeah to go into this

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,679
in more concrete terms like what i

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,720
describe measuring energy efficiency

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
making this

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,560
part of what we consider the quality of

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,079
our software

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,079
we also have areas where i think we

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
don't have to do a lot in terms of

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,359
changing our software or introducing new

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,000
things but

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,320
we can just demonstrate how our software

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,640
extends hardware live we can demonstrate

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,640
how our software preserves user autonomy

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,280
it does that i mean we know that

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,960
um if we could prove that by putting a

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
blue angel on our software i mean that

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,800
would be even better so so this is one

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,280
of the things i think which can help us

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,560
there

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,720
and then of course spread the word

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,920
helping others that's something where we

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,640
can have this

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,640
bigger effect

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,119
so i would like to do that i i work on

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,320
that for

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
i think a little bit more than a year

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,560
now um and um i

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,760
love to continue on that and i would

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
love some more help

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,200
with that so i'm i would be really happy

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,560
if people join me

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,079
and we create more momentum there

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,119
and there are a couple of things which i

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,680
think uh these are also smaller things

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,599
these are not all huge projects um for

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,760
example definition of standard user

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,280
scenarios for your application that can

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,520
be quite simple and then

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,359
finding a way how to automate that it

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,960
might also be related to other testing

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,720
tasks you do

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,320
then also the measurement itself that's

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,280
also interesting how to

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,960
do that how to execute that how to

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,240
create reports about that

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,800
so this goes a little bit more in

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,800
scientific areas but also than other

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,280
things like just documenting

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,520
our user autonomy so making sure that in

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,119
our documentation it's clear

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,280
what our privacy statement is

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,320
so linking that in the documentation

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,480
making sure that

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,920
users know that they are in control if

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,040
they are using our software what is

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,640
happening there

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,960
so we we could do a lot there and these

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,560
can be small tasks this can be bigger

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,240
tasks so i would like to invite you to

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,440
join this effort and do something about

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,440
sustainable computing

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,960
where do we get together we have a

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,079
mailing list energy efficiency at

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,599
kde.org

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,520
so there's not a lot of traffic there

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,720
yet but this is an obvious place where

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,200
we can meet

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,400
um there are also two repositories one

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,040
for the energy

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,480
measurements that's the feedback

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,280
repository there that's

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,960
meant as a pretty open project so across

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,320
applications maybe even across

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,960
communities

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,720
and there's another repository where we

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,599
make the work transparent

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,880
for creating these applications and for

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,280
more discussions about that

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,960
and answering questions and everything

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,040
um i scheduled you both

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,079
for tuesday so i would like to invite

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,160
you to join

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,079
this as well and then talk more in depth

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
about what we are doing there and what

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,680
we can

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,680
can help there

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,720
yeah in the end we are filling this hole

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,440
in the form of kde i think we we can do

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,560
a lot there

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,359
so let's do something about it let's go

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,720
towards

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,839
sustainable computing and that's

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,160
it what i wanted to tell you and so i

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,880
think we have a few

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,760
minutes left for questions so i haven't

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,480
followed the

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
matrix channel but so adam you have to

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,160
help me out and

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,359
yeah there was something that we should

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,040
answer now

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,720
thank you thank you very much cornelius

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,560
indeed we do have a couple of minutes

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,839
left and we do have some questions

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,359
here in the in the widget um

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,000
so going from the top of the most score

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,960
scored ones kevin has looked at the

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,440
repositories

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,240
and he has found the documentation but

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,079
not really

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:30,079
something actionable or easy to run

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,560
to measure the apps um how far

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,480
are we from actual off-the-shelf tooling

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,320
for these tasks for example

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,839
uh would be needed for ci

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:45,280
yeah um so the the tool

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,359
which was used for the measurements

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,800
which were done by the students at the

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,560
um compass that was um

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,160
where you would pronounce it so there's

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,240
the configuration for that it's in the

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,880
feedback repository so this automates

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,400
basically clicking buttons moving mouse

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,480
typing in so you can use that to repeat

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,800
uh the usage scenario and play

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,400
and play that back so it's a little bit

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,680
fragile so there are certainly better

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,760
ways how to do that

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,720
i think especially for our applications

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,880
um

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
probably the the people who are familiar

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,560
with applications can find better ways

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,119
how to automate that in a more reliable

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,720
way

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,599
so at the moment we have the these

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,640
marxiona scenarios configuration

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,280
there also is a little bit of

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,640
experimentation so i try to do that with

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,760
x2 tool which is just as fragile but

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,960
in a different way and

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,960
there are certainly other ways how we

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,560
could do that so this is one of the

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,320
topics of research

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,000
also so help with that automating that

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,760
is very welcome

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,760
but also looking at these existing

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,920
scenarios and the configuration which is

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,920
there

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,520
okay thank you very much and i guess one

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,400
more won't hurt

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,960
this is coming from nate efforts to

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,839
reduce

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,480
consumption via improved efficiency

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,200
generally

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,359
encounters the javelin's paradox which

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,640
is the increased efficiency simply

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,960
in sense incentivize more usage how do

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,160
you

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,160
think we can address this

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,680
yeah i mean that's a very good point and

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,480
as i said

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,520
i think it's a very complicated topic

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,800
also

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,839
not all usage is the same so if you use

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
for example

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,599
like green energy then maybe consuming

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,720
this energy

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,079
is not as harmful as if you don't

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,760
and this paradox of course also is true

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,839
and i mean you see that with software i

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,079
mean software hasn't become

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,880
much faster it just has become more

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
powerful and

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,000
and we do things in maybe different ways

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,839
than before

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,680
although the hardware has become much

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,800
much powerful in

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,839
over the past couple of years

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,240
so i think we have to look at it

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,280
from a holistic perspective i think

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,119
important is

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,560
measuring things so we have data so we

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,319
can actually tell

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,000
what is happening there so we can tell

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,800
our software is becoming

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,119
less efficient or more efficient but

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,200
then also this other the more social or

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,880
more idealistic

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,319
approach to also look at these software

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,560
factors look at

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,839
what is reflected as user autonomy in

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,520
the blue angel but

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,440
i think we can also make this a the

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,800
bigger uh

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,560
idea so maybe consuming less

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
something which can't really be

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,640
justified from a technical point of view

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,599
but you can find other ways um how you

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,200
can look at that

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,280
so i think if we put together all these

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,599
different factors the different views

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,280
um the the values we also have i think

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,000
in the kde community we have strong

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,319
values which

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,920
go into this direction of working in a

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,119
way that that we can work in a

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,960
sustainable way

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,640
um i think we we can put this together

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,440
it's not a guarantee that we would solve

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,839
it and that

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,200
will magically eliminate uh waste and

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,880
energy consumption which is not

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,520
necessary necessary

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,720
but i think putting a focus on the topic

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,280
following the idea

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,839
doing something about it will help us at

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,800
least

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,160
have a little bit of improvement and

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,079
that's what counts right

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,839
small improvements put on top of each

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,160
other they they give the big

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,839
improvements

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,599
yeah thanks uh one more

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,480
sure okay this is coming from niklas

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,119
regarding that certification how does

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,680
resource

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,680
intensive software like 3d graphics or

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,599
video rendering fit into this

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,960
scheme i would assume they are

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:43,839
inherently more demanding

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,240
yeah we have to say that for the

00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,440
a big part of of the certification in

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,680
the current state

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,680
is about making things transparent so

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,319
also measuring

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,720
consumption putting data and publishing

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,839
that it's not so much about

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,119
absolute numbers so um it

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,640
actually assesses the criteria that um

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:10,560
they are not judging if uh an

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,480
application is consuming an absolute

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,599
maximum number of energy or something

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,599
but that there's

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,599
that there's made an effort to make this

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,200
transparent to measure it and so on

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,960
and of course depending on the use case

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,680
you you need more energy i mean if you

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,400
do

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,000
um complex calculations um you need more

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,480
energy than if you just

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,359
show something and nothing happens with

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,800
this

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,920
so i think that that's we are not there

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,640
yet with really

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,359
doing these comparisons across maybe

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,160
different

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,119
software categories even but it's more

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,760
about

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,680
creating awareness and being conscious

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,200
about how much energy you consume and

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,880
what effect yourself to actually have i

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,000
mean this whole idea of that

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,839
software is a major factor

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,680
in your energy consumption is something

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:59,440
which is not not obvious

00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,160
for for some people or in some some

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,920
also in some ways of thinking um you if

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,400
you think about it i mean you see it you

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
have a

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,000
nice computer and you use it and you're

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,680
happy that your battery life

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,520
is becoming longer with a new device

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,119
but then looking at what what actually

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,960
the data says and if

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,400
the way how software is done has has an

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,720
effect on it

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,319
it's it's not easy to tell at the moment

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,640
because we just don't have

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,520
looked at that yet so from this point of

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,040
view i think

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,480
um making data

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,240
making measurements making data

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,119
transparent and then looking at it and

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,720
then you can

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,160
judge in different categories i mean

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,359
what is necessary and if you can see

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,119
okay you have this

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,200
the game which is just as good as the

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,079
other game but only consumes 10 percent

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,319
of energy

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,079
maybe that's an indication for some

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,160
people at least to prefer this

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:54,160
game which uses less energy

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,560
yeah makes sense um okay

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,160
we are out of time thank you very much

00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,839
cornelius

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,760
for the presentation and for answering

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,240
the questions

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,160
thank you great event really i'm really

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,200
happy and proud to be part of it and

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,880
join me for the both if you're

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:16,160
interested in deeper discussions about

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,160
