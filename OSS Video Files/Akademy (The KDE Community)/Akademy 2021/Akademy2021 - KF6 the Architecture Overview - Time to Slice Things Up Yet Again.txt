A new Qt major version has been released. As usual this is when we really get into preparing the next incarnation of our development platform. The last time we went full steam into cutting kdelibs into pieces. What are we going to do this time? Beware, this talk might include references from slasher movies.
The move from kdelibs4 to KF5 was kind of our own Copernician Revolution. We used the opportunity to split our single platform package into dozens of components. This served us well but the model proposed to structure them is showing some limitations. With KF6 this is our opportunity to address those issues.
In this talk, we will revisit how the KF5 offer has been structured. From that scheme we will highlight what worked well and not so well.
Then we will proceed with an idea which was discussed during the latest KDE Frameworks Sprint and see how it could improve things. This is an interesting cocktail which is one part technical, one part community and one part marketing. Indeed, it might end up redefining in parts the nature of both KDE Frameworks and Plasma.
Finally, we will explore the current state of our frameworks to see how far we are from the new envisioned structure and how feasible this rethinking of our platform is.
