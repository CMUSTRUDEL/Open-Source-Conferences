00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,400
so

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in a in promo we have

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
we have a problem well we have plenty of

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
problems but

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,760
we have one specifically with uh

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,280
social media um

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,840
we have uh uh to

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
we post a lot to social media we post to

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
many

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,640
places on social media to cover a wide

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,239
spectrum of of people and to reach

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,680
a lot of people um so

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,120
uh this is a very error prone

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,160
uh and long

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,320
not long but tedious process because we

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,440
have to do it by hand

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,799
uh we do not publish

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,000
uh the same message to different

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,400
platforms

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
although the the content may be the same

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,799
the form may change so

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,600
if we uh what we post to facebook and to

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,920
re uh

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,439
to facebook and twitter for example may

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,119
have a different phrasing as to what we

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,439
post to linkedin

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,159
because linkedin it has is more

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
professional

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,759
so we can't be so chatty or what we post

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
to reddit because

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,520
reddit users well they're quite

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,880
particular

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,520
and so they don't respond the same to

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,400
to uh what we do on twitter and facebook

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,400
etc

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
obviously when we post instagram again

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
it changes because it's more instagram

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,399
is a more visual

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,680
medium etc so it's we

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,759
when we have to post something to to

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,799
to social media uh there's uh

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,960
quite a lot of work involved right and

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
it can take quite long and as i say it's

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,759
quite error-prone

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,119
because you can post something and then

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
you realize you've got a mistake and you

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
have to take it back or

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
or whatever or you post the wrong

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,479
message to the wrong

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,840
uh to the wrong platform and then you

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,599
have to take that back and

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,599
substitute with the new one etc

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,879
that is the first problem we have we

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
have

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,120
another problem that is about scheduling

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
so uh

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
we can a lot of platforms have a

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
scheduling feature that allows you to

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,680
post stuff at a later date or at a later

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
time

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,959
so you can post stuff for example that

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
you need to post

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,879
for um another time zone that is not

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
yours you can post it at four o'clock in

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
the morning but you don't have to stay

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,720
up so you can post it

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,599
but not all platforms have it

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,440
and every platform implements scheduling

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,560
in a different way and

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,680
that is again is uh is a bit of a mess

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,560
so for example if

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
twitter has scheduling through tweetdeck

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
facebook has scheduling built-in

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,560
masterline has

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,680
scheduling built-in also but no

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
actual um you can't do it from the web

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
interface

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,680
uh you have scheduling can only be done

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
from a mobile application so you can't

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,879
do it from the desktop client ever

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
uh reddit has just included scheduling

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
for mods

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,319
but if you're not a mod you can't use

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,799
scheduling et cetera

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,920
and as i say they're all different they

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,040
all use different

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
uh formats and so it's a mess you have

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
to

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,560
again it takes a lot of time and

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,920
uh it is not convenient

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,080
we have another problem with uh

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,519
social media in that um

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,720
we're talking about credentials here

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,760
about accessing stuff

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,799
so some platforms do

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,439
implement uh

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
users that have different privileges

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,000
that access different accounts so you

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
can have a team

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
so on facebook you can have an admin and

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,680
you can have an editor and they have

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,480
different privileges editors can only

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
post

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,280
and admins can do things like post but

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,639
also they can ban people or they can

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,759
uh remove comments and stuff like that

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,759
uh tweet deck also has a

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
certain degree of of um

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,160
credentials and um and roles

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,280
mastered on has nothing youtube has

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
nothing

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,400
ready has mods but

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,919
uh that is a different thing altogether

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,520
so um basically on many

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,440
of the platforms we put i think

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
instagram doesn't have any

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,720
uh any roles either in any shape or form

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
and it

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,000
can can confirm this so on those

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,120
platforms that don't have roles

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,160
uh it's either all on or nothing so uh

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,759
if somebody wants to post

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,479
to to to master for example they have

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,400
access to everything they could delete

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
the whole account if they wanted instead

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,240
of posting

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
they could do all sorts of things um

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
this of course

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
is also a problem

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
oh

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,400
we have looked into uh existing

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,160
solutions

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,120
and they they do exist there is a famous

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
one called

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
sweet which you would probably have

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,600
heard about their

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,240
logos a little now a little up

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,120
yeah and uh there are many more there

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
are

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,199
whole dashboards for posting to

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,280
to social media but they don't really

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,160
help us because

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
because of several problems they have so

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,039
the first one

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,400
is represented graphically here none of

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,080
them are free

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,319
in any uh sense of the word so they all

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
you you you always have to pay for them

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
or you get you know uh

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
a very watered down version that only

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,759
lets you post

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,560
nothing not not what what we want or and

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,560
they are also

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,280
all proprietary which comes with another

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,080
problem

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,080
and that is that um

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,520
they are a bit spy they

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,280
part of their their business also means

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,560
um harvesting uh the the data that

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,000
really is should be for you right

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,400
about your users and about what you post

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,919
and so on which is does not uh

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
marry well with with any of our

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,880
principles

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,080
um the other problem

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,120
they have is that okay i didn't know how

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
to represent

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
graphically a service so i just drew a

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
dot so

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,599
they ignore the existence of

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
the fetiverse completely you know they

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
have

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
the typical things they have anything

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,199
that becomes popular in this proprietary

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,639
goes so they have twitter they have um

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,599
youtube they have facebook they have

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
instagram tick tock etc but there's

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,840
nothing like

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,639
mastodon or uh diaspora

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
or anything like that so and when we

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,520
post to the

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,039
these places we have a special interest

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,880
in in promoting our stuff on the

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,479
fedevers

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,400
because that is that is sort of like the

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,680
the the the ecosystem of

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,039
of um uh

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,720
social media platforms that most uh

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,800
uh we can most identify with

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
and the final problem that these

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,800
services have is that they are very

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,400
um inflexible there

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,680
so you get what you get

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,440
if another platform comes along that you

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
are interested in you have to wait until

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
they

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,440
implement it or and if they don't have

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,319
no interest in implementing it then

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,960
you just don't get to post their via

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,160
their

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,240
their service and that's it so

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,520
so these things exist but they

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
do not would not work for us

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
very well and the fact is that we have

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,519
been going after this

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,440
solving this problem for literally years

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,719
and we have never found a service that

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,159
would help us

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,720
so enter

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,720
a solution and i'm going to play a video

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,000
i hope you can hear it

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,320
if not adam please tell me if if

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
you can't hear i'm going to transfer

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
this is always a bit dodgy i'm going to

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,440
transfer

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,480
uh the the the screen control to

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,399
to the video player this is my nav

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,440
uh my colleague running a demo

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
of what he developed during a season of

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,200
k

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,839
of kde to solve this problem this

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
is a

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,720
proof of concept stuff works

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
so let's see if you can hear it if not

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
my knife can explain

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
later what's going on or life or

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
whatever

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
so

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
let's see here we go

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,519
make that full screen

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,720
and here goes okay

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,480
so good evening and hi

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
i'm manus and today i'm going to give

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,040
you a short demonstration

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
of computer which is the social media

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
app i

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
built during us

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,440
was that the promoting used to spend a

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,360
lot of time

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,839
posting to different platforms the

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,480
content was same or similar

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
so i wanted to work on this application

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,519
that would let you post

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,800
just one place and it would then

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,720
post accordingly to the other platforms

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:29,040
so the app itself is

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,839
on top of fast okay so if we

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,839
let me just also

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,079
show you how to actually run the cell

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,600
so step one has to export the parts for

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,190
the credentials which are the like

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,219
all the social media credentials

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,219
[Music]

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,209
[Music]

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,160
local home state house

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,800
so uh currently there is no client

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,640
i work on the server i am currently

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,519
working on a cli client so

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,240
meanwhile let's just head to slash docs

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
which is

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,440
the documentation endpoint for the

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
swagger ui

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
so which case structure ui will let you

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,440
test and work in case it's

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
similar to

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
oh sorry paul you need to unmute

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,519
yourself it's

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,519
the sound is coming from the like sorry

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,440
okay so let's just get the poster

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
so the platforms that are currently

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,399
supported are twitter mastered on

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
android

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,920
so first of all uh let's let's just go

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
to all platforms

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
i'm just going to type on it it means

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,959
that we have a test image in the main

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,839
directory as well

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,639
so i'm just going to say test.png the

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,279
text

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,000
is let's say the text is it we never

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,560
gonna give you

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,519
the time so now i'm not adding a time

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,399
right now

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
but you could add a time stamp over here

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,040
and you could specify what date and what

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
time to

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,959
post so currently if you don't add a

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
time

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,480
it gives you a buffer of two minutes and

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
after two minutes it closes

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,120
automatically

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,120
so let's enter

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,839
they were

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,200
so now let's just execute this

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,480
so start the scheduler to using this to

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
start the jobs

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
and then it gives us an id for each of

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,839
the jobs

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,399
now if i go to sched start let's just

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,320
start says schedule has started

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
now if i do there's another endpoint

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,079
that you can call with the scheduler

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
it's

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:20,160
schedule so you can do this to

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,160
get what the jobs are currently

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
for the next couple of minutes let me

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,600
talk a little bit about the tech stack

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,839
that is

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,440
used over here and then we can see the

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,199
post actually happen so

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
the primary tech stack as i have

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,160
mentioned before is fast apa

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,000
that powers all this this entire bracket

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,000
other things that you can do with this

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,320
are basically

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,079
you could potentially of course you have

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
a ping endpoint

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,320
to just check if the server is running

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,199
properly

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
and then you could put you could also

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,000
you

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
look at the users and try to see your

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
user information which i'm not going to

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,440
do right now

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
and and you can have goes to the token

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
endpoint

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
for authentication

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,639
with fast api we have ap scheduler which

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,279
is advanced python scheduler

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
for handling all the scheduling so one

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,680
important thing that we wanted to have

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
with this app was that it could have

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
scheduling built into it

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,560
so it has a server in the client the

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,880
server runs 24 7

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,000
the client just schedules the post on

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,600
the server

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,040
and it doesn't matter if your laptop

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
gets destroyed or whatever

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,959
the server is still there and the post

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,639
is still going to happen

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,519
so it's it's 36 let's see if the post

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
has happened so

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,720
you have a bunch of launch save telling

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,279
us that initially first you're supposed

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
to master

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
the response for download over here also

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
so now let's just

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,160
go and see the post actual post so we

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
have

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,480
this first one ready

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,959
then we

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,959
hopefully

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,959
so this is how cockpit works currently

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,040
there is no actual client for this i am

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,959
working on a simple cli client

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
that is just going to pass the email

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,680
file and it's going to show you all the

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,639
posts for you

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,759
yeah so this is pretty much it for the

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,199
demo

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,199
thanks for coming

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,560
okay okay so

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,120
so that was the demo thank you

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,839
i mean thanks man for recording that i

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
have

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
i have watched that demo like three or

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,480
four times and i always get excited when

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
i see

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
the the the post actually pop up in the

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,279
in the

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,639
social media platforms although i

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,959
already know that it's going to happen

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,640
but

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
anyway

00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,480
[Laughter]

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,480
anyway so

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,800
so this solves several things uh it

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,000
solves the problem of multi-posting

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,279
so so uh let me let me qualify that

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,160
it's not because manufacturing a bad job

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,799
anything like that you

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,199
as you as you can see it works the thing

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,400
is

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
that at the moment and this is the this

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,439
is

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,439
what uh mana was able to develop in in

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,720
the time i located in the in the season

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,160
of kd

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,520
at the moment it posts only to three of

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,919
the platforms that we uh support that we

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,280
regularly post to so it posts it post to

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,799
um

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,240
uh ready to post to twitter and it posts

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,360
to mastodon right um

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,360
we have tried uh facebook but facebook

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,840
is very very complicated

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,840
we'll figure it out sooner or later uh

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,559
and uh so on uh

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,320
so multi-part posting works

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,440
and also um

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,280
uh uh scheduling works scheduling

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,320
uh already works completely

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,080
well as you have been able to see and as

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,360
man i've said

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,640
what uh what happens is that

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,799
you can have a server out on the

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,000
internet running 24 7

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,080
and you can post uh

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,679
your your stuff you can send the stuff

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,240
to the

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,840
the server and the server will be in

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
charge of scheduling it

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,840
not each individual platform so

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,320
uh the scheduling happens at the server

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,480
level

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,080
not on on the platform so we don't have

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,760
to worry about all the different ways

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:43,840
scheduling has been implemented

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,840
in each of the platforms

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,760
then uh this is not implemented yet

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,039
this is the the question of roles so

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,559
what uh what we want to we what we want

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,760
to have is to able

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,760
to be able to have um teams

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,360
accessing the server with different

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,440
privileges so

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,799
that you will have an admin who will be

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
able to assign roles

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,160
you will have an editor who will be able

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
to post but not

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
assign roles for example and things like

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
that that is not done yet

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,000
but well it is in in our future

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,880
we are uh as you have as you saw from

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
the video

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,960
you are it does have a login so it's not

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,559
open to anybody but

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,600
at the moment it's very much uh like

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,200
one only user but hey

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,280
you know uh again this

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,919
when we get this implemented it will

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,000
solve a lot of problems because

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,480
each platform facebook and twitter and

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
uh etc implements roles in a different

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
way

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,919
again so we will have only one way

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,280
and and it will be done by

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
the cockatoo server

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,240
next um

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,919
this is this is private you can run it

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,080
on your own server or you can run it

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,039
locally and you can just connect to it

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,000
uh locally so no although of course we

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,880
haven't stress

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,080
tested it uh for vulnerabilities or

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
anything like that we haven't done

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,799
anything like that

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,880
um it is already uh a bit better than

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,840
sharing all your stuff with the platform

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
that you pay for

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,760
so you know because you can run it

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:35,440
locally and it only gets

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:38,400
the stuff um you want it to get

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
and oh before i go on that uh i've i've

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,720
missed

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,799
apparently um uh a slide

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
it is also flexible because it's plugin

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,600
based

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,720
so each of the platforms it posts to

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,520
is implemented in a plugin so the

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,799
as as new um

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,720
[Music]

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,720
social media platforms appear or if you

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
want to do a niche

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,080
if you want to post to a niche platform

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,400
you would have to develop

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,760
obviously you would have to develop a

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,799
plugin for that and just

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,080
plug it into to the coco 2 server and

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,080
you will have it

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,559
implemented now how hard uh

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,559
it is going to be to write the plugin

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,760
for that platform will depend on the

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
api of of the platform of course but for

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
things like

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,600
the fetiverse it's pretty easy because

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
you know we document everything

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
everything

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,080
is open et cetera for twitter apparently

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
it wasn't very hard either for

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,280
either facebook we did have a problem

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,799
but uh

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,120
there you go um

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:48,400
yeah so it's time to meet our mascot

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,440
as the title of the of the

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,159
talk uh said this is called cockatoo

00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:00,159
because cockatoo are noisy little birds

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,000
that and we make noise on um

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
social media and that's why it's cover

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,360
two and also because cockatoo

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,080
start with a k of course and the our

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,840
mascot is called carmen which is a nice

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,960
little cockatoo

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,679
and it was designed by uh somebody on

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
the krita

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,400
artist discourse

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
forum he was very very kind and he

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
created all this and

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,760
he created a logo and it created a

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,080
little icon

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,240
and they are very pretty and very funny

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
now

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,880
now comes what we need from from new

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,000
folks

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,640
um so to

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,159
continue the process of course mana is

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,440
going to continue developing

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:55,200
but it would be good if we had uh some

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,919
support from other developers so

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,840
for example i divided them into what we

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,320
want short term midterm

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,400
and long term short term we need a

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,840
client

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,000
mainly a proof of concept client

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:15,600
not uh try to develop a cli

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,480
uh client for for this uh talk but

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,720
he didn't have time so we want first

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
that something that we can just use from

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,880
the command line

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,760
just to you know test it and we also

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,799
need

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,799
the rest of the plugins for the

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,240
the rest of the platforms we support so

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,360
as i say

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
facebook we haven't got a plugin we

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
haven't got a plugin for instagram we

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,400
haven't got the product game for

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,799
linkedin and we haven't got a plugin for

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,159
um hacker news either and we haven't got

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,720
one for diaspora

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,640
and those i think are all the platforms

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,200
that we regularly post to

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
and we need a plug-in for each of those

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,240
right

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
that's the short term

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,799
then uh we would need uh this is in not

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,559
in any particular order of importance

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,520
but we would need to implement the roles

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,919
and privileges

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,960
of course as i mentioned before at the

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,159
moment it is

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,400
one user gets uh the login and

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,080
does all the posting uh and we would

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,440
want to be able to

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,000
assign teams uh to boston because that

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,919
is what we

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
actually have in promo we have actually

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,400
a team of people

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,360
who have access to the to the social

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,279
media platforms

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,279
and they are who post

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,600
we would also want to implement accounts

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
now this is different

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,039
from from implementing roles and

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,880
privileges

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:50,320
i for example manage personally i manage

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,600
three accounts for kde i manage the kd

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,400
free accounts for kde on twitter sorry

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
i manage the kd community account i'm i

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,039
i also

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,200
can post to the academy account

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,720
and then you can also post to the lab

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
plot account

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,720
so we would also want to implement that

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,760
that one user

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,400
could have several accounts so

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,760
several people should be able to post to

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
one account and one

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,880
one person should be able to post to

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,799
several accounts

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,480
uh ideally right so that's another thing

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,600
it will also be called have a convergent

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,640
client i don't know if the

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,440
people are here but if they are uh you

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,679
know

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,799
convert if you can convert your macedon

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,600
client into uh

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,520
into a cockatoo client that would be

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,559
really really cool

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,240
so that we could have a graphic client

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,000
i don't know what that would look like

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,039
because

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,080
as i say this is not a one-to-one thing

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,279
you don't have one message to one

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,760
account like you have

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,279
you would have in your tokaton you have

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,240
said you have potentially several

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,279
messages

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,880
to several platforms

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,480
how that would look instead of a big

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,320
long list of

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,919
fields and stuff like that maybe

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,440
something node based i don't know what

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,720
it would look like this is

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,480
i think an interesting challenge

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,279
we also want to create

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,159
the api documentation so that people

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,640
outside

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:30,320
from our immediate outside even from kde

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,960
can develop um plugins for their own

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,960
platforms

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,159
and we want to set up a server we want

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,080
to set up a server

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,120
for for the the kd community so that

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,559
all projects can um

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,200
post using this system to all

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,159
the the social media accounts they have

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,600
this would be

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:57,360
really really cool thing to have

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,360
long term well

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,919
it would be interesting to turn it into

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,039
an end user package so package the

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,159
server with

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,159
maybe a down a watered-down server

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,000
uh with uh a client so that

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,000
you know people could just have it

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,279
installed locally on their on their

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,760
desktops or on their

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,399
mobile phones or whatever and they could

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,080
manage

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,399
several of their own accounts um

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,159
not maybe getting rid of the team stuff

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,799
maybe getting rid of the

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
the the multiple of the multiple role

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,760
stuff so

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,559
the there is a watered-down version and

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,159
it works on

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,720
a phone so that you know you can just

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,360
put it out like an app and people can

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
manage

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,720
several um accounts

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,799
there are several social media accounts

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,559
from one place it would be nice to have

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,039
a dashboard to see how

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
um posts are going this is a typical

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,159
thing

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
in the other proprietary solution so you

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,520
post and

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,360
it also tells you how it's doing what

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,279
sort of engagement it's getting

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,279
how it's doing compared to other posts

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,399
you have made et cetera that would be

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,360
nice i mean it's

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,360
not not a priority

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,799
it would also be this engagement feature

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,080

you should this is you should probably

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,000
when something when something rubbish is

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,240
happening in the other room not

second of all we do have viewers and

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,039
they were enjoying

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,919
the talk i'm very sure they're just

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,039
probably not

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,159
not sure what to um or to ask the tool i

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,679

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,320
of technical things you could have

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,519
managed there's tons of technical things

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,760
yeah i i think

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,720

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,840
