Title: Akademy 2021 - Journey from Farm Girl to Holograms
Publication date: 2021-06-29
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Jeri Ellsworth
Jeri Ellsworth shares her journey as lifelong inventor, entrepreneur and maker. The journey from farm girl to holograms is not without its ups and downs. She will share how obstacles were overcome through courage, persistence, and a inquisitiveness about how the world works. Some stories feature Jeri's mentors who were critical to achieving success, whether it was to design the best toy that could delight millions of kids or how to become lead avionics engineer for a low earth orbit rocket. Jeri's current startup is the culmination of an 8-year quest – including a nearly $2million Kickstarter campaign – to bring holograms affordably into every home, called Tilt Five.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,880
ceo and co-founder of tilt 5 and she's

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359

welcome jerry

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,039
wow it's such a joy to be here you know

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,920
i've used

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,720
linux and unix most of my professional

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,239
career

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,280
and i'm proud to say now i

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
uh on my primary work machine now i have

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
uh kde install and

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
loving it i don't know why it took me so

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,200
long to

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
move over to you guys so i have a lot of

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
slides to go through

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,600
and not much time it's going to be a

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,320
little bit of a rambly story but

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,440
i hope the the key points that you'll

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,199
pull out of this

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,559
is look for mentors along the way

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,840
because my life has been

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,680
drastically improved because of mentors

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
and people that have helped me along the

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
way

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,600
so my background's pretty interesting

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,200
um i grew up in rural oregon

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,240
i was raised by my father who um

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,560
raised me by himself he had a pretty

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,880
lucrative professional career

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
when i was born but unfortunately my

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,680
mother passed away

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,880
the first year after i was born

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,000
and he had to give all of that up and

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,799
moved to this little farm out in oregon

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,960
to be closer to my grandmother

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799
he tells stories of you know how

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,640
agonizing it was when he'd have to go

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,200
off on business trips he'd give me to

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,320
the

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,600
babysitters and i would cry and wail

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,040
and he'd come back five seven days later

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,960
and i bonded with the uh the sitters

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479
and then i'd cry and wail like who's the

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,759
stranger to pic

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
pic picking me up and so he made some

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
huge sacrifices

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
um to to raise me and i really

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,520
appreciate that

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,920
and in fact he's my first and probably

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,200
most

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,560
important mentor in my life

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,720
so uh as a kid

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,360
um i was super curious i didn't like

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
uh not understanding how things worked

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
and at a

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
super young age probably i guess like

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
five or six

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,200
old enough to sneak into my dad's

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
workshop and get screwdrivers and pliers

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,360
and stuff like that i started taking

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,920
apart all of my toys

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,000
this was very frustrating for my father

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
because you know toys are expensive and

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
i was just dismantling them but i just

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
had this

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
innate curiosity like you know why does

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
this thing blink and make noises i had

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
to know

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,280
and that kind of curiosity has stuck

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,280
with me my entire life

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
to kind of stave off destroying all my

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,959
toys

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,239
i specifically remember there was a time

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,640
when my father

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,159
who at this point had sold everything

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,680
moved to oregon and has

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,360
had been working as an auto mechanic a

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,959
kind of low paying job

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
auto mechanic um

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
brought home a box of automotive light

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
bulbs

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,599
and some batteries and some duct tape

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,720
and some wires

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,760
and he showed me how to use tape

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,440
to stick to batteries and to light up

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,159
light bulbs and this was really amazing

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
i had so much fun with this but you know

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
of course as a

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,959
curious kid the first thing that you do

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,879
is

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,159
like here's a light bulb here's a

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
different light bulb so i

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,319
took my gooseneck lamp tipped it

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,560
backwards and screwed the light bulb

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,200
and took one of the automotive light

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
bulbs and dropped inside and

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,879
as you could imagine you know i fell

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,640
backwards

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,599
there were showers of sparks everywhere

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,640
the circuit breakers in the house blew

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,400
i was scared i didn't want to

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
reveal it to my father but i couldn't

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
hide it for him for from him very long

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,400
eventually he figured out that you know

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,199
half the power in the house was blown

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,759
out and

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
he gave me a bit of a scolding you know

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
and

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,160
turned it into a learning lesson you

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,479
know about the dangers of electricity

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
you know batteries are one thing but

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,120
playing around with 110 volts is another

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
thing

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
uh but you know my my desire to take

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,240
things apart

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
you know wasn't staved off with just a a

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,360
rack

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
of automotive light bulbs i just had to

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
know

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,400
how everything worked and so i continued

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,680
to take everything around me apart and

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
including in

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,360
i should probably tell my father about

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
this someday i took apart some of his

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
stuff and actually

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,000
you know broke it and

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
at this point i don't know i was

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
probably six or seven my father

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,400
had done a really bold move

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
he had given up his job as an auto

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,360
mechanic he'd scrape together

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,400
enough money that he could

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,520
buy or lease a gas station

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,520
and repair shop across town and

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,919
it was an interesting time for me

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,440
because i remember we were

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,960
struggling a lot at that point there

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
wasn't a lot of money

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,880
and we lived off of a lot of the food

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
and the uh the meat that we raised on

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
his little amateur farm

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,039
but that was it was a really magical

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
time to watch him

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,520
go through that struggle and and he was

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,320
very candid and shared it with me

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
but one of the things that he did that

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
sticks with me today and was such an

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,759
amazing thing

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
is he couldn't necessarily buy a lot of

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,639
toys from me to take apart but he did

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,319
put a box

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
out in front of his gas station with a

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
sign on it that said

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,080
bring your broken electronics and put

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,199
them in here

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,759
and every like three or four weeks or so

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,840
i'd get a random box full of

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
broken electronics that i could just

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
take apart

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,280
and play with and it was the best toy

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,440
ever right i i didn't know

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,160
anything about what was going on inside

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,919
but i was taking these things apart

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,520
i would bend the little components back

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,520
and forth and break the leads off and i

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,759
was making little piles of

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,240
resistors with no wires on them and

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,759
capacitors with no wires

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
and so much fun i mean of course there

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,639
were some uh

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,560
negative things that happened to i

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
remember one time i took apart a tape

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,840
deck

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,960
and there's this thing called the

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,120
capstan

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
it's on this big metal circular thing

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,400
and it's like a nail sticking up and it

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
was sitting on the

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,039
uh floor of my bedroom and my dad walked

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,840
in with his bare feet and stepped on it

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
he was not happy about that so you know

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,000
there was a

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,039
another lesson to be learned there about

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
clean up your your room uh and don't

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,440
hurt me

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,280
um never lets me forgive that i forget

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,520
that even today

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,599
uh so i got a little more advanced i

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,039
started learning more about electronics

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,680
playing with light bulbs

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,680
and all these like components are

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
soldered into these circuit boards and i

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,560
wanted to get them out

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,840
and so i discovered that i could take a

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,440
ac wall transformer and hook it to a

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,160
power transistor and it would get

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,680
really really hot and when it would get

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
really really hot it would melt the

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,039
solder that holds

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,120
the components in of course i was far

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
too young to have a soldering iron i was

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,759
seven or eight years old at this point

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,360
probably and so i was secretly doing

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,479
this in my

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,080
bedroom when my father wasn't around and

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,400
it worked quite well it was kind of

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,280
smelly so i had to be careful

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,720
uh one day i was trying to do this and

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,240
my father walked in

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,919
and he was not pleased at all and so

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,520
he's like you know i'll teach you how to

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,479
use a soldering iron

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,800
and you know stop doing this let's teach

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,199
you how to do it safely so at a very

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
young age my father was open to letting

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,520
me

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,759
use potentially dangerous you know

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
equipment and he got me a soldering iron

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,159
and showed me how to use it

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,800
and that was that was amazing um the

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,039
number of hours that i sat

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,880
just pulling components out with the

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,100
soldering iron

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,919
yeah it's it's staggering

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,640
[Music]

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
so at this kind of young age it was

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,240
probably around i don't know maybe

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,880
1983 or 84 somewhere in that time range

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,200
uh we went to visit one of my of the

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,040
friends of the family

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,680
and they had a ti-99 4a computer

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,320
and i had been seeing computers on

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
movies

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
for you know years and years and i was

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,399
just

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,240
enamored with them these magical devices

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
that could do anything

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
and so i begged our friends to let me

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,120
play with the computer

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,959
and i spent probably two hours just

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
typing on the keyboard

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,360
things like you know i didn't i didn't

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,880
know how to program so i just type like

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,240
draw house and it would say syntax error

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,959
hmm paint house

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,440
syntax error but that didn't stop me i

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,240
was just having a great time

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,720
doing things with this computer on an

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,800
old black and white television

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
you know eventually you know we went

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
back to the friend's house a few times

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,519
and they brought out the programming

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,080
book for it and said like this is how

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,519
you

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
you use it and one of my most fond

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
memories

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
of using a computer was the first time i

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,120
entered

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,320
several hundred lines of code and made

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
what ti called it mr bojangles dance on

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,519
the screen he was this little block

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,880
character that would just dance and his

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,560
his uh hands would move up and down

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,560
i was completely hooked at that point

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,120
so i started a full court press

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
on my father to get me a computer and

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
back in those days

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,000
you know there weren't really computer

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
stores around you could go to you'd go

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,320
to the big box stores and

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
living out in the middle of nowhere i

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
was nine miles away from the closest

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,680
town and we didn't have a big box store

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,920
so it was probably like an hour

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,959
you know to get into one of the bigger

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,880
towns

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,800
i was constantly begging my dad like

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,600
let's go to montgomery wards or let's go

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
to sears so i can look at the computers

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
and occasionally you know we would be

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
making a trip and he would make a

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
special

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,640
stop by the computer and electronics

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
section

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,040
and back in those days the store

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
displays were really primitive they

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
didn't have any kind of software running

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
to demonstrate them they were just a

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,399
line of computers there was ataris and

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,360
apples and and uh vic-20s

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,959
and and they were just set up sitting at

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,279
basic prompts

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,640
so you know i at this point i knew how

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,240
to type things like

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,440
10 print hello go to 10 and i'd be like

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,640
dad dad come look

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,399
i'll write a program for you and

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,680
uh super fun i know that he was

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,079
struggling he was trying to get his

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,079
business

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,720
off the ground he couldn't really afford

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,720
to do this

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,279
but i just i really wanted one and

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,680
he was he he made it happen and it was

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
funny is i wanted a vic 20

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,600
because back in the day there was the

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,720
vic-20 and commodore 64.

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,639
the vic-20 had really big characters

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,680
on the screen so the letters were really

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,600
big it was 22 columns versus 40 columns

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,639
the super high resolution display of the

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
c64

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,120
but that's what drew me in was it was

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,480
the one with the biggest characters

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,600
but fortunately for me um

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,120
he got me the commodore 64. and

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,120
the commodore 64 was an amazing machine

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,760
and many of you have probably used those

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,440
if you're a child of the 80s but

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,680
i think it was really interesting the

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,040
way that he

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,680
purchased this he purchased it and hid

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,839
it in his bedroom in the closet

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,279
and i caught him one time he didn't

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,560
realize that i'd caught him

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,240
but he had he had been unpacking it from

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,839
the package and hooking it up to his

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,680
television in his bedroom and trying to

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,880
learn how to use it before

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,160
giving it to me so you know i'm living

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,839
with my father alone

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,240
and i'm riding the bus going to school

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,000
so a lot of times i'd come home you know

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
he had to work until six or seven

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
o'clock at night at a service station so

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,760
i had like three hours by myself

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,079
so for probably a full month i would

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,920
sneak in and i would take the uh

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,680
the computer out and the disk drive out

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
and i'd hook it together and i'd start

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,000
playing with it

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,360
and at the time we only had one diskette

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,680
for it

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
and i didn't know how to format the

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,399
disks

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,000
or do anything with them and it had some

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,279
demo software on it

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and it had like a few blocks free of

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,920
storage

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
and i wrote a couple programs and filled

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,959
the disk up

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,839
you know before i even got a chance to

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,079
uh that was revealed to me

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,320
so eventually my father gave it to me no

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,200
special occasion it was pretty

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
pretty amazing i pretended that i was uh

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
surprised

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,800
and and uh we set it up in a common area

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,000
and uh i started playing with it a bunch

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,560
so he did go and buy me one video game

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,279
cartridge

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
donkey kong um i must have been talking

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,800
about it he went out and got it for me

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
and it was amazing to have a video game

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,199
that i could play

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,880
because we had no other software for it

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,519
so but that didn't satisfy me forever

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,199
i was again a curious kid it didn't take

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,519
me long to like open the top of the

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,680
commodore and peek inside

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,680
and then also i didn't have really a

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,800
good concept of how electronics

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,720
or eprom storage worked

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,880
so i figured that this cartridge was

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
just making electrical connections

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,320
so i should be able to make the same

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,440
electrical connections by sticking

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:29,279
knives and forks into the cartridge slot

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,839
and so i did that i would stick a

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,160
a knife into the fork into the cartridge

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
slot and the screen would just wig out

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,279
and there'd be all these colorful things

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,320
happening on the screen and i was just

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,959
sure

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
if i poked it in the right way a video

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,160
game would pop

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,320
up and uh so i ended up burning up two

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,800
or three commodore 64s and he had to

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,720
send them off for repair or exchange

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
i you know they're probably under

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
warranty at this kind of early stage i

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
probably was

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,279
i helped the demise of commodore back in

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,320
the day

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,680
but um i remember the day he came back

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,519
uh after i'd broken it and he's like

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,360
yeah those commodore 64s are junk

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,399
they're not reliable so the guy at the

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,120
store gave me this commodore plus four

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
uh-oh you know those of you that know

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
commodore

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,079
the plus four was not really a great

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519
gaming machine

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,480
but um that was okay uh i wasn't

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,880
necessarily

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
into games as much as i was into

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,519
programming

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,440
and this particular computer had an

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,759
advanced version of basic

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,759
with graphics routines and things that

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,680
you could do with simple commands versus

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,440
the commodore 64 which was

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,120
a lot closer to the metal

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,120
so this was my computer for many years i

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,360
was very very happy with it

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,440
i learned a lot on it so

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,440
probably one of the pivotal moments for

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
me is my father bought me this

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,759
electronics playground as a

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,920
a gift and this is where there was a big

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
transition for me from

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,160
not understanding electronics to

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,519
starting to learn electronics

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,399
i'm probably 9 or 10 at this point

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,320
and these electronic kits were amazing

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,320
they had a bunch of wires

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
and a booklet with cute little cartoons

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,959
and they told you how to hook these

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,120
things together

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
and you could make police sirens or you

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
could make an

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
am crystal set radio or you can make the

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,680
seven segment

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,560
um play like a a dice game and

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,279
i just endless hours of fun and learning

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,839
with this

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,279
it was such a great investment in my

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,880
future

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,000
and because i got into this

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,199
i met a boy oh no actually i should

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,560
i should tell this story first so

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
at this point i'm starting to learn a

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,199
little bit about electronics

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,279
and i have a step brother he didn't come

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,639
around much he was kind of far away and

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
occasionally he would show up he was

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,440
much older than i was

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,519
i we didn't have the best relationship

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,199
for various reasons

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,199
probably because he was older and then i

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,039
was always kind of probably taken care

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,000
of a lot more by my father during these

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,799
visits

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,280
but i started to discover with uh like

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,679
three

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,319
three little components a transformer a

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,480
relay

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
and a nine volt battery i could make an

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
improvised

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,160
taser and so i wired this thing together

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,120
and i could generate

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,480
a little taser device that would

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,840
administer

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,679
mild shocks and so you know my brother's

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,280
giving me a hard time one day i run off

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,480
i grab my taser

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,720
and i zap him with it which he

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,400
promptly ripped out of my hands and then

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,280
started torturing me with it

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,160
so you know it's like okay if i'm going

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
to do this again

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
i need to like come up with a better

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
plan

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,840
so my plan was you know i'm going to

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
hold on to the 9-volt battery so if he

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
tries to rip it out of my hands i'll

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,520
have the battery and i can get away

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,320
and so i some other visit he comes by

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
and i'm going to go

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,799
tase him and

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,840
i shock him and he grabs the transformer

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,919
rips it out of hand and

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,559
success i have the battery in my hand

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,640
and so he starts chasing after me

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,960
and i'm running away and he takes this

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,320
heavy transformer and throws it and hits

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,840
me in the middle of the back

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,039
so you know listen learned you know just

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,600
don't tase people

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,600
uh it's just not a good idea um even if

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,240
you can disable the taser

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,679
also because of that electronics kit i

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,080
got into

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,360
to radios a quite a bit because they had

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,960
a project where you could make a little

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,400
transmitter

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,000
and also in the junk bin at some point

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
uh that my father was bringing home i

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,440
got a shortwave

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,200
radio and uh this was really an amazing

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,720
device for me the shortwave radio in

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
particular because it could pick up

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
foreign broadcasts and it was this

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,799
strange world of

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
you know foreign broadcasts and you

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,240
would hear morse codes

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,760
and all kinds of interesting things and

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,600
it would fade in and out at different

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
times of the day and i was just obsessed

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,919
listening to it

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,480
i think for me being a kid living by

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,640
myself

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,320
nine miles out of town with like no

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,520
nearby friends

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,880
it it it was it made me feel a little

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
bit less lonely

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,919
you know knowing that there was like

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
this big world out there it was super

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,440
fascinating

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,240
and so also got into building these

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,039
transmitters

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,600
and i i met a boy on the bus who is just

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,760
a couple years older than me

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
and he was also into electronics and

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,679
also

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,400
had one of these electronic kits and he

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,919
was also interested in transmitting

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,840
and so we started building little pirate

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,200
radio stations

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,720
and we would start we would meet up

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,039
and we would count the number of phone

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
poles from his house that we could hear

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,919
the radio station on our little

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
transistor radio

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
on the am band and then we'd ride from

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
my house and we'd count phone poles and

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,080
that's how we would compare each other's

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,400
transmitter and it was kind of this

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,760
war between us like one day he would

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
like optimize his

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,600
and you know he could go a little

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,360
further and then i would build one a

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
little bit more powerful and you know we

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,400
were all

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
we were doing this with like scrounged

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
up

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
you know eventually you know we moved

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,159
from using little

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,200
small transistors to we started finding

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,799
uh old tube radios at you know in

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,919
garbage cans and stuff or sitting

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
alongside the road

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,760
and we started building bigger and

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,400
bigger transmitters

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,240
and um at some point we built

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
transmitters so powerful

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,600
that we'd ride for most of the afternoon

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,000
we couldn't reach the

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,440
end of our transmit range and uh that

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,080
was when we switched to

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,520
from the am broadcast band to the fm

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
broadcast band

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,039
and we started having you know it's a

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,080
little more difficult to broadcast on fm

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,000
and it doesn't go as far

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
and we the same thing was super

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,720
delightful i had a trick though

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,960
uh you know if if mike ever sees this

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,720
uh i uh my bedroom is on the bottom

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
floor of the house near where the phone

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,159
lines came in and i found if i could

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
wrap like 10 wraps of wires around the

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,320
phone lines i could get extra distance

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,520
i think he never understood why every

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,240
time we would kind of go

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,240
under a phone pole my signal would get

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,480
louder

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,559
i'd say you know i didn't know what a

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
mentor was at this time but even though

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,679
mike

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,440
uh was just you know near near an age he

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,039
was very much a mentor he's a little bit

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,840
more skilled than i was

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,000
and i started to learn this kind of

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,559
you know if you can be excited with your

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,559
mentor about what you're doing

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,919
they'll give you lots of help in

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,240
exchange

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
and that's that's worked for me and

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,880
helped me

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,880
throughout my career and my entire life

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,520
so around this time i was just so hungry

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,559
for information about electronics

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,360
i'd go to our old carnegie

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,440
library which was really small and it

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,679
had like three books on electronics and

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
i

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,840
read them cover to cover like 20 times

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,039
and they were probably books from like

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,640
the 1940s

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,919
really far out of date but um i looked

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,200
on to a couple gentlemen that came there

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,640
they were ham radio operators and i got

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,600
to know them they were very

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,159
old compared to me i i probably hadn't

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,400
interacted with anyone that old before

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,400
uh but i i got over my creeped out

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,200
factor of talking to old dudes

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,320
and uh we started talking about

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,720
electronics

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
and i i found that they were a fantastic

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,799
resource

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,280
for me and

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
they invited me over to their homes and

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,360
one of them had like this shed

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,440
outside back of their house and the

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,159
inside the shed looked like this

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
full of electronic gear and radio

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,480
equipment

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,360
and this is this is like dream for me

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,799
all of this equipment and ability to do

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,600
things and

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,480
here is another set of mentors that came

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,679
into my life

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,280
that uh really helped accelerate my my

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,039
skills

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,640
and uh in fact those those folks

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,240
i wish they were still alive today i

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,440
would go to them and thank them

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,600
profusely for what they did

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
but they started giving me really junky

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,200
old equipment

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,039
you know they gave me an oscilloscope

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,640
they gave me volt meters they gave me

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,000
books and

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,120
this was so critical being like 11 12

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
years old

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,600
to have this information and

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,120
it it helped me start doing projects

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,120
that were more advanced i started

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,679
interfacing things to my computers like

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,840
making sound digitizers i started making

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,039
amplifiers for my pirate radios which

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,960
they hate it they are

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
always offended by that but i think they

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,200
also

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
kind of were were happy that i was

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,520
interested in

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,880
in radios but that was great um

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,360
it it helped so much

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
uh about this time i think i was 12 13

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,039
or so

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,000
my father he's like you need to start

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,039
working in the family

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
business so after school i'd ride my

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,640
bike

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,840
over to my dad's gas station and in

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
oregon

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,919
you can't pump your own gas into your

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,600
car so you have to pump gas

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,279
so first thing i started to do is

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,679
pumping gas into

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
uh you know people's cars as they came

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,960
up learned how to like make

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,200
change and do all those kinds of things

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,320
and it was quite amusing i'm like

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
to us 12 year olds and like uh how much

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,120
gas would you want and they're like are

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,640
you old enough to do this

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,960
and in most cases no but since you're a

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
family member you can do like sketchy

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,799
stuff like

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,640
pump gasoline but he also

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,480
made me do everything around the gas

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,600
station like he would service

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,360
um vehicles changing oil uh

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,039
swapping out cylinder heads lapping

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,200
valves uh

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,960
you know honing cylinders and he had me

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
doing all of that stuff and it was such

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,600
a great experience i learned so much

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,279
you know at the time i maybe was a

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,120
little grumbly that i had to go work

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,320
every day after school instead of going

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,440
home and playing with my computers

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,799
but it it turned out to that i i learned

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,840
so many skills

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,480
uh and it was also hilarious too

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,960
like we had a hoist that would lift the

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,120
cars

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,120
up and uh i was so short

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,880
that you know to drain the oil out of a

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
car i had to lower it way down just to

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,360
get to the the plug

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
and sometimes i couldn't get the plug

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,240
loose or the filter off and my dad would

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,679
have to like

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
you know try to almost crawl on his

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,320
hands and knees get under there to help

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,880
me

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,000
uh but uh this did one thing for me that

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,559
was awesome

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,600
and oh sorry i'm ahead of myself

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,880
around the same time um i really got

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,400
into phone freaking

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,480
you know back when there were landlines

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,600
and people weren't walking around with

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
cell phones uh we had these things

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,000
plugged into the wall

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,600
and it you had to pay money to call long

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,039
distance and do things like that and i

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,520
was forbidden

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,360
to use the phone because for my dad

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,039
feared that i'd run up the phone bill

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,559
so somewhere along the way i acquired a

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,760
broken telephone

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,360
fixed it ran wires like sneakily

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,919
alongside the house kind of buried in

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,400
the dirt to reach the phone connection

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
and i took the bells out of the phone

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,840
and

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,000
uh had my own little phone and in fact

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,520
actually the first phone that i ever

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
had was one that i made out of that

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,320
electronics kit and i used the

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,159
morse code key to um dial

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,559
so for the those of you that have ever

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,400
seen a rotary dial phone when you dial

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,919
a number it's actually pulsing it's

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
making and breaking connections on the

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,640
phone line

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,320
and you can actually do the same thing

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,039
with the morse code key

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,720
so i'd call my friends up on my

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,720
electronics kit

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
and i hated my friends that had a zero

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,039
or a nine in their

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,440
uh their phone number because you had to

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,120
do nine or ten pulses to do it

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,200
but at this time also um i started

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,640
learning about phone systems and i was

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
super curious about them i learned a

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
bunch of different things that you could

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
do

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,760
i had my friends convinced that i had

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,399
complete control over the

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,159
phone systems i made some circuits that

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,600
would pick the phone up so fast if they

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,760
tried to call me

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,480
that it would immediately pick up before

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,559
the ring tone was on their side

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,159
and uh i hooked it up to a tape recorder

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,399
where i could play back messages like

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,840
this phone number has been disconnected

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,240
and so i'd prank call them and they'd

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,679
call me back and i'd be like

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,200
you know you call call me back i'll just

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,600
disconnect my phone line i can just do

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,919
this because i'm so smart

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,039
um and also during this time i guess

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
this is what i was getting at earlier

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,760
still working at my dad's gas station

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,880
gave me money so i could get more

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,600
stuff and so i worked you know one

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,480
summer and got a commodore 128 which was

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,440
amazing

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,919
and i worked two full summers um plus

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,799
after school and got an amiga computer

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,679
so much fun i learned so much it's kind

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,200
of funny is

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,720
after i got the amiga it was such a

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,320
complicated computer i ended up

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,919
probably using my commodore 128 more

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,679
this is also the time that i got into

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,360
bulletin board systems i convinced my

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,039
father i would be responsible with a

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,080
phone and i got a modem

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,559
and what an amazing time like

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,120
pre-internet days you could go online

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,600
you could get

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,200
games and stuff a lot of them bootleg

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,240
you know pirate but

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,600
but you could also go online to multi

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,679
uh multi phone line bulletin boards and

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,080
play games with people through doors or

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,360
have

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,960
a chat and

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,799
i did that for quite a few years now

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,799
that i think back about it like how

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,600
sketchy that really was i mean there

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,880
were times

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,000
as soon as when i got my car that um

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,720
i would meet up with people of all ages

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,480
for meetups and you know today you would

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,640
never do that but back then

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,640
i guess a simpler and more naive time

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,919
i um so all right i'm a weird kid

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,480
right i am into science of all types i

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,799
uh

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,240
when i was a kid i built model rockets

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,799
and launched them all the time

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,360
and i ended up burning like two acres of

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,360
grass

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,559
because i launched a model rocket and it

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,760
set a big fire

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,679
and the other kids around school

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,480
couldn't relate to who i was

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,120
and so around junior high and high

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
school

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,320
i started getting picked on a lot like

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,520
really bad

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,080
uh emotionally tortured

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,559
and physically tortured they would spit

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,159
on me

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,840
they would write on my clothes they'd

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,159
shove me around and they just

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,039
abused me because i was an easy target

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,279
and i was

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,360
i was a sensitive kid i was you know

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,399
they could make me cry easily

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,360
and so this went on and on and on and

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,760
it into high school and i think it was

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,799
my

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,880
uh sophomore year i just

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,080
like had enough one day there was this

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,880
bully kid

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,880
he tripped me when i was walking in the

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,399
front of the class i was carrying this

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,840
like big thick it was probably a math

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,200
book or something i can't remember now

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,120
but a thick one

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,520
and i just lost it i just snapped

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,919
internally and i just started clobbering

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
him

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,679
like you would like you'd throw a discus

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,360
i just started smacking him across the

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,399
head with this and he flipped out of his

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,080
chair

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,200
and i was just going ballistic on him

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,960
and our school and unfortunately

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
you know i wasn't smart enough to like

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,720
start beating this kid up

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,080
um not in front of teachers and we had

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,279
this zero tolerance

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,360
policy there so you know

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
i just remember the teacher grabbed me

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,679
by my arm and drug me down the hall my

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,679
feet probably didn't touch the floor

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,679
you know two or three times as i went

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,159
down to the principal's office

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,519
and got uh suspended for like four or

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,279
five days

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,720
you know i was pretty distraught about

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,679
it you know my

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,679
my father he was pretty understanding he

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,320
knew i was being picked on he often told

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,519
me

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,159
he'd give me pep talks um he say things

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
like

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,640
hey you know you're tougher than them

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,559
you're you're mentally tougher than them

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
you know if they pick on you it doesn't

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,279
really matter you know

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,600
just think of it this way this is

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,440
actually something that i remember today

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,760
and i think of this today when people

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,919
like give me a hard time like online

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,440
uh he's like you're stronger you're

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,200
mentally stronger than them so if

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,559
they're picking on you it doesn't matter

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
and if they're picking on you they're

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,279
leaving somebody else alone

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,159
right but that wasn't the case you know

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,200
when you're like 15 or 16 years old

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,279
suspended i come back and then all of a

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
sudden there's this new respect for me

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,120
in

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,640
in particular with the bad kids and

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,880
you know i'm intelligent so i'm like hey

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,480
you know if i hang out with the bad kids

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,919
and they respect me

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,399
then the bully jocks and and the

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,600
mean kids will leave me alone and so i

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,440
started going down this

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:15,200
really really uh uh

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,320
angsty teenager path i was the bad kid

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,240
and i my grades like started slipping i

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,440
started failing grades

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,679
getting held back getting in trouble

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,440
it was very common for me to get hauled

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,000
home by the police late at night because

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279
i was out

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,480
past curfew you know i was

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,080
i i didn't feel good about myself and i

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,799
actually channeled that

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,840
into some unhealthy behavior like i was

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,840
always like the one

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,760
like hey let's climb this barbed wire

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,720
fence and like go into this restricted

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,840
area i don't care

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,240
like yeah and

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,000
so that was much of my teen years and i

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,080
was always looking for an

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,120
edge that made me kind of a little bit

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,480
more edgy

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,480
you know i went through different phases

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,519
like kind of a goth phase things like

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,120
that

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,919
i'm still working with my father at the

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,000
gas station and he's super concerned

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,320
about me he's giving me a hard time

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,840
he's like you know he's trying to give

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,200
me some of the tough love stuff that

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,960
wasn't particularly helpful

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,559
saying things like you keep this up

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,679
you're gonna be face down dead in a

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,720
ditch someday

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,600
and he's yeah maybe he is right but you

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
know

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,039
lots of yelling and screaming and like a

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,440
divide

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,279
between me and my father growing at this

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,760
point and

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,919
um but i was always looking for

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,880
something really crazy and edgy and i

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,799
remember

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,039
briefly my father had done some kind of

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,799
hobby racing on a dirt track

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,399
and i thought that was really cool and

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,039
at this point i had a car

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,320
and uh some of my friends and i would go

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,000
out to the

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,919
local racetrack that was pretty close

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,679
and we'd watch this quarter mile dirt

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,120
track racing and in the upper left hand

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,159
corner that's what this looks like these

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,919
really fast cars

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,159
like sliding around really close to each

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,080
other um

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,679
that picture is not a picture of my me

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,279
out there all the other pictures that

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,799
are of me but uh so i came back

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,200
after watching a couple of these and i'm

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,440
like dad i'm going to build or

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,280
i want to race cars build me a race car

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,720
and he's like no way there's no way i'm

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,240
doing that

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,760
you know it's too dangerous he's trying

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,760
to like protect me

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,359
i'm like no i got to do this i gotta do

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,520
this i'm just so into it

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,560
and i'm pestering and build me a car

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,679
build me a car

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,480
and finally after months and months he's

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,919
he's like i'm not gonna build you a car

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,599
but if you can figure out a way to buy

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,679
one or build one yourself that's the

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,760
only way you're gonna do this

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,200
and like all right i really wanna do

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,839
this and so

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,359
i started to ski come up with a scheme

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,879
to do this i'm like well i'm not gonna

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,879
be able to afford to

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,639
buy one these things are thousands and

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,079
thousands of dollars

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,760
so like i'm going to build it

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,919
so i started going to all the machine

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,359
shops in town and talking to the

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,040
machinists and telling them what i

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,880
wanted to do and i found this one

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,079
machine is mr harter

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,720
another mentor entering my life and he's

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,320
like

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,040
i'll teach you everything you need to

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,280
know but you have to help me out

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,720
and you have to work for me i want you

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
to come in on saturdays

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,000
and and work for me and i'll teach you

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,000
some stuff

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,800
that you need to know and so that's what

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,720
i did i'd get up super early which i

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,040
didn't like doing and i'd go into his

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,119
machine shop and he would make me

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,280
do all of the dirty work i'd have to

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,119
climb around under the lathe and clean

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,359
the chips out and

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,520
oil the the gibbs and the ways and

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,440
haul metal around i was just kind of

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,480
slave labor labor for him

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,079
in exchange he would take me aside

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
towards the end of the day and he'd grab

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,240
a

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,240
scrap piece of metal and teach me how to

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,760
weld or he'd show me how to chuck

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,720
something up in the lathe

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,200
and and you know bore holes or turn

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,160
metal

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,880
and it was amazing he was a funny

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,520
character

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,280
um and i've i've run into folks like

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,960
this before

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,880
and they they

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,640
they pretend to be grumpy when you do

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,400
something wrong but actually inside

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,000
they're kind of happy about it

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,400
and once i figured that out i started

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
feeling less bad about when i did things

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,680
wrong

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,800
for instance you know tapping holes in

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,040
metal is difficult

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,520
and then tapping holes in a lathe while

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,280
it's spinning is even more difficult so

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,359
you know he would let me make mistakes

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,960
drill a hole the wrong size he knew

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,800
and i could kind of see it on his face

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
as i was getting ready to like tap a

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,320
hole and i'd run the tap in it would

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,000
snap the tap off and he'd just like

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,440
throw his hands up and just kind of make

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,880
like some kind of like

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,320
oh you just cost me money ah but

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,119
yeah and i'd catch him kind of like

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,520
smiling like yep

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,640
you you brat like these are the lessons

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,680
you need to learn

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,000
and i'm really really grateful for him

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,000
and and out of that relationship i was

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,760
able to start building this chassis

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and welding it together and part way

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,320
through building this first chassis my

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,800
father came around she's like

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,760
all right you know i'll help you finish

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,280
this thing

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,119
and uh i want you to be safe and uh that

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,800
was amazing you know we my father and i

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,359
had this big divide and we came back

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
together

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,280
and and we worked on this race car and i

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,960
learned a ton

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,320
uh the first year that i went out to

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,920
race i was

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
convinced i would be the fastest race

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,920
car driver of all time and i went out

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,520
and i was like the absolute slowest

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,880
i racing cars does not come instantly

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,320
you have to practice you have to have

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,480
discipline you have to

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,240
make sure your car is set up right the

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,320
second year

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,160
i got another mentor in my life this is

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,920
another amazing situation

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,440
uh there were books and stuff on how to

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,359
set up race cars and i like

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,440
bought these books and obsessed on them

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,520
and there was a phone number in the back

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,960
a sales number if i found if i called

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,640
that number i could actually

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,000
it was just a kind of a small scale

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,040
business i could actually reach the guy

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
that wrote the book

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,839
and i was constantly asking him

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,599
questions like how do you do this how do

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,280
you get better

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,839
and uh he's like you know

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,680
if you just come out to florida and i'll

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,880
put you up for a week or two

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,880
and i'll teach you everything you need

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,520
to know about racing you know pretty

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
much

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,720
quit calling me about all this stuff

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,200
that's what i think it was and so

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
i'm maybe like 17 years old at this time

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,560
maybe 18

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,720
and i jump on a greyhound bus and i

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,440
drive across the united states

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,920
and spend a week with this gentleman and

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,200
his

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,079
his wife his name is duke and

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,520
what was interesting about that was that

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,280
he

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,800
told me all the basics like you know is

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
how you adjust your shocks and cross

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,359
weight and stuff in the car and that was

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,359
helpful but he

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,040
spent probably half the time or more

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,000
talking about the psychology of racing

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,800
and how to

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,359
be a winner and that was interesting you

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,839
know

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,800
sometimes being a winner is not about

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,640
having the best car

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
being a great driver it's about winning

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,200
the hearts over of your fans or winning

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,800
the hearts over

00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,359
of the um the flagger at the track

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,560
and anything you can do to to do that is

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,280
helpful

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,160
and so i came back and you know took

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,119
that to heart

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,640
and uh i became very competitive i

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,720
learned these little tricks

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,160
things to get fans really excited about

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,920
me for instance i would spend a lot of

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,240
time in the audience

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,960
talking to fans and kids in the audience

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,720
and

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,079
i started winning so many trophies i

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,760
didn't care about these little plastic

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,680
trophies anymore so then i would just

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,040
give the trophies to the first kid i saw

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,720
when i went into the grandstands i

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,720
became like this huge

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,640
like fan favorite and of course the

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,560
flaggers

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,640
you know the flaggers are there to make

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,960
money by selling beer

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,880
and nachos in the grandstands so they

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,760
want happy customers

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,440
and so you get a little extra favoritism

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,200
if you uh are

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,359
a favorite around the track so it was

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,000
super super awesome it was a great time

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,920
in my life

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,960
um i started making so much money doing

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,640
that i dropped out of high school

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,480
my father was a little concerned about

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,160
that but he now like was had these

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,400
ambitions he thought he was trying to

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,359
connect me with these like pro racing

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,760
uh teams out in north carolina and stuff

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,599
he

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,079
thought i was going to be like this race

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,079
car driver a pro

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,480
um so

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,599
i did that for four or five years and

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,839
it's not easy

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:25,200
you know being a lady around the track

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,680
it's it's rough it's it's a boys club or

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
it was

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,760
in particular back then so it was

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,119
frustrating for me i didn't like the

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,720
dynamics of it

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,720
so one day i was visiting one of my high

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,800
school friends and

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,079
as sitting in his man cave that he had

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,000
built in his uh

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,319
garage and in the his garage he had a

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,520
486 computer so this is probably

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,119
around 1995 and he's like

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,720
this computer would be fifteen hundred

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,760
dollars but i tricked

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,920
a wholesaler into selling me the parts

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,960
for wholesale prices and it only cost me

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,079
like 700

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,880
to build it and at this point i had been

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,160
building race cars and selling race cars

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,760
and winning you know money i completely

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,359
turned into an entrepreneur at this

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,640
point plus seeing my father being

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,720
entrepreneur help too

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,119
i'm like oh that's some great margin and

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,440
boy that'd be a lot better than

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
racing cars every single weekend i'm

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,599
like how about i just sell off all my

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,079
racing stuff and let's open a computer

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,319
store this is 1995 windows 95

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,000
isn't out yet but aol is a thing and i

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,520
could i could see that

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,920
you know it was going to be big so

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,040
we started a computer store things took

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,440
off pretty well

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,680
now remember i was this super edgy gothy

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,480
kid every other word was a swear word

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,160
out of my mouth

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,599
i had a chip on my shoulder a bad

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,920
attitude and of course

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,839
first thing we get the company off the

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,160
ground me and my business partner we

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,240
just

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,440
are at each other's throats constantly

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,599
and he ends up

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,920
booting me out of the business and i

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,599
lost everything i was so young and naive

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,240
i didn't know what to do it was just

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,319
like

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,839
he hired a lawyer i was out so

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,560
i'm uh in my apartment i'm crying in my

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,720
beer

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,160
and i'm like i don't know what to do i

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,800
call my father

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,720
like what should i do and he's like well

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,400
you know it was a good run

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,680
you should go back to school and get a

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,480
degree uh get your high school diploma

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,440
you know get back on track in your life

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,680
i'm like oh

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,599
okay and so i sat there and think

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,599
thought about it then i got mad i'm like

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,960
this guy can't do this to me

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,040
and this is going to be a reoccurring

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,400
theme with me

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,480
like i'm going to put him out of

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,480
business and so

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,560
i sold everything i had i scraped every

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,319
penny together i

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,680
broke the lease on my apartment i got my

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,880
deposit back

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,000
i found a little one shop barber or one

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,800
chair barber shop

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,839
um just down the road from his store

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,560
rented this thing

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,160
dirt cheap uh threw the barber chair out

00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,720
the back which it disappeared at some

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,760
point

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,760
you know overnight managed to get the

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,680
store kind of looking like a store

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,839
started living in the back of it but i

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,119
had no money for

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,800
the electronic components so it's like

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,800
well i got to bootstrap this somehow so

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,119
i'd go to his dumpster i'd get all of

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,440
the

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,119
colorful boxes and put them all over the

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,040
wall so it looked like i had inventory

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,480
and the customer would wander in and be

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,160
like hey i want that

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,440
sound card to be like well that one's

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,800
committed but if you give me the money

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,359
for it i can get you another one in

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,119
three days and

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,359
that's how i bootstrapped the company uh

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,720
it was really robbing peter to pay paul

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,599
constantly and plus

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,280
i really hadn't learned how to relate to

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
customers at this point i was still this

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
really edgy

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,440
you know kid um had some really

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,240
embarrassing moments like i didn't have

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,920
enough money to pay for garbage service

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,440
so i was like taking my garbage and

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
throwing in all the garbage cans around

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,640
the neighborhood

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,440
and i got caught and the police came by

00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,880
and

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,560
and embarrassed me in front of one of my

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,480
customers and

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,839
you know it's you know i've probably

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,079
spent the first six months

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,119
just starving to death in the back of

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,280
the computer store not

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,480
really getting off the ground but

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,200
fortunately for me

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,040
across the street another mentor entered

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,119
my life he was an insurance salesman he

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,520
was interested in computers

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,280
he came by at lunch oftentimes and he

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,760
would bring me food because he knew that

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,119
i was just barely getting by

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,599
and he would say the nicest things to me

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,560
he's

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
like he would give me pep talks and he

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,720
then he'd

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,560
give me some guidance he's like

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,319
you know i noticed you interacting with

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,119
that customer and you were swearing in

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,880
front of them

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,640
that's not really a great way to be

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,280
relatable

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,079
and i i saw you like you know the way

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,359
you dress

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,119
you know having super dark eyeliner

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,680
and like gothy that's not really

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,400
relatable and torn up jeans and stuff

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,599
like that

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,760
you know you should kind of look the

00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,560
part you got to look the part and

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,160
you know i admired him he was successful

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,640
and i started to

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,000
adapt those things and introduce those

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,040
into my life and it

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,839
it was interesting like this was a weird

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,280
moment in my life where i had my friends

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,040
that were still kind of living that

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,680
lifestyle and i'm starting to diverge

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,520
from them

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,440
and you know i've heard it as like the

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,560
crab pot syndrome where crabs will pull

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,040
you back in and

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,720
it felt like like a lot like that like

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,079
it's i try to step forward it kind of

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,760
felt like i was always being

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,599
pulled back into their gravity and that

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,319
was that was rough and difficult and i

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,160
had to grow and get around that

00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,000
what's interesting is this whole time

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,880
even when i was racing cars and had that

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,119
success i

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:46,079
really didn't like myself as a person

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:49,440
right and uh but as i started to

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,599
like get away from you know pretending

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,359
to be this angsty person i started to

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,599
like feel better about myself

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,880
and have more confidence then i started

00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,440
realizing like

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,079
when i stopped being like a punk kid you

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,720
know the world

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,319
out there you know isn't going to treat

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,000
you bad they actually start treating you

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:09,280
pretty nicely and

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,760
and that was a really great transition

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,599
so this computer store was awesome it

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,079
started to take off

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,839
i wouldn't be undersold i would actually

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,720
lose money to make sure that i stole

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,440
business from my um my ex business

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,599
partner and it got to the point where

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,280
every wednesday we would get our

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,160
shipment of parts we'd have a line out

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,720
the door

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,640
and i started hiring people and we were

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,079
breaking down pallets of parts and we're

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,920
handing parts to people

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,000
and building computers and i was hiring

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,880
more people it was so exciting

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,240
moved into a bigger space and we're all

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,319
like young kids

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,520
at this this point i'm in my 20s i'm

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,280
hiring lots of like

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,880
computer enthusiasts that was one of the

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,040
things i learned is higher like people

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,640
that are enthusiastic about

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,119
the business and it was just explosive

00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,040
growth

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,920
everyone was getting on aol everyone was

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,480
getting into games and 3d cards and

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,839
i started expanding having more stores

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,280
and it really had this family vibe to it

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:10,720
and i just i thought this ride would

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,560
never end it was just getting ever

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,240
bigger and bigger

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,560
and so

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,520
at the same time this allowed me to

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,680
start to

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,440
pick up some of my favorite things to do

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,880
building electronics and now i had some

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,559
money that i could do some more

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
complicated things so

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,319
and this is where my story becomes a

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,559
little non-linear uh because

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,319
this this phase of things kind of

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,800
overlaps into my next phase

00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,400
of my career as well but i started

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,319
building things i started building lots

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,480
of things for fun

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,839
uh like little circuit boards that did

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,559
things like drove

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,040
video displays or made sounds i started

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,599
like

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,760
reverse engineering some old commodore

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,680
chipsets i started going to events where

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,040
i could show this stuff off and it was

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,280
super fun

00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:02,559
and i started learning a lot about

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,920
uh serious engineering at this point i

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,119
met a couple mentors

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,079
along the way um got

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,280
introduced to a lot of industry legends

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,800
who

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,960
um turns out that you know

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,040
in time we became friends with a bunch

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,960
of these people got to meet wozniak and

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,920
some of the original amiga folks like

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,720
dale luck

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,000
and some of the original commodore folks

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,000
and

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,839
in television folks and a lot of these

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
folks became my mentors in my sounding

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,960
board as i was starting

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,520
to get more serious about electronics

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,559
but

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,880
in the same time i was

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,400
uh still riding high on the computer

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,920
store so there was no reason for me to

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,680
like get too serious about all this

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,880
electronic stuff

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,280
until year 2000 comes along and like

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,800
business is going crazy up to year 2000

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,880
everyone's replacing their computers

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,960
because they're going to explode on day

00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,640
one of year 2000

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,440
and uh day two in year 2000

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,319
sales dropped off like a brick and in

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,319
six months

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,400
my computer stores were hemorrhaging

00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,440
money like crazy

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,000
and uh this is kind of a heartwarming

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,960
part

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,960
of my career i it was so rough at the

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,319
time but i think back now on it so

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,000
fondly

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,079
you know i was always very transparent

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
with my personnel about what was going

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,240
on

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,319
it's like this does not look good we're

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,440
in trouble we have to do things

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,000
and so people volunteer voluntarily left

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,680
the company

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,079
we started trying other things we

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,079
started uh

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,520
selling cell phones and trying to do

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,760
network gaming centers just

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,760
everything to keep the the company alive

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,480
but it eventually got to the point where

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,000
it was unsustainable and i just couldn't

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,480
take it emotionally anymore

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,200
having to like see my friends leave you

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,920
know

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,839
one at a time and so i went to the

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,400
managers about the various stores that i

00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,760
had

00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,520
and i said okay here's the deal i'm out

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,520
i'll give you the inventory of the store

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,400
if you want to run it and give it a go

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,079
if you can manage to make it work fine

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,240
someday if you feel like it pay me back

00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,680
for the inventory but it's yours

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,359
we immediately closed down three of the

00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,000
stores there wasn't enough interest two

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,040
of the stores

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,040
uh continued on and uh

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,640
you know the two stores went on for

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,359
quite a while one of them eventually

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,599
folded but

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,119
um i was just in canby oregon recently

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,880
and drove past and

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,640
one of the stores is still there it's

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,280
amazing they they changed the name a

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,200
little bit

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,400
uh they have a new logo which was maybe

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,880
a better you know

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,800
a good decision but they made it so

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,280
kudos to them it's amazing

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,920
they made it through that bloodbath and

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,680
survived

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,720
up till today so

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,400
here i again i go back to my father i'm

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,079
like what should i do my computer stores

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,680
completely failed and of course he gives

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,319
me like the the safe

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,160
thing to do and he's like all right

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,960
you're still young go back to school get

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,680
a degree

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,960
you know get your life back on track and

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,160
what do i do

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,280
i'm like nah i i can do this you know on

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,319
my own so

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,359
i started going to silicon valley and

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,520
meeting people

00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,359
and so i still had some money left over

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,480
from the computer stores and so

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,760
i started flying to different

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,359
conferences and i'd go to the

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,160
conferences and i'd shake everybody's

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,440
hands and

00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,040
this is where i started meeting some of

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,040
these people like wozniak and some of

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,040
these people that i idolized and

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,000
got to know them and also met a lot of

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,640
entrepreneurs in silicon valley

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,640
and uh

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,160
so i started interviewing for jobs like

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,720
i want to do this and i had

00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,319
this i had this duffel bag full of

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,839
circuit boards that would i'd bring to

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,280
the interview and i'd like to throw them

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,960
out over the table like here's a board

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,520
that does this this one has a processor

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,000
i emulated an fpga and this is that and

00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,880
i was just getting no after no after no

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,720
no one would

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,800
um believe that a high school dropout

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,040
could do it

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,480
i started getting desperate for money i

00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,920
ran out of money i couldn't fly down

00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,359
there as much so i just started taking a

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,040
greyhound bus from portland where i

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,800
lived at the time

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,720
and i had to

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,559
ride this greyhound bus for 12 hours to

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,400
go to these events and if i had to do an

00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,280
interview i had to drive it down

00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,559
and you know eventually i got a big

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
break

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,599
and this gentleman i met him at a trade

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,119
show

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,800
he's like you seem like the right type

00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,200
of person for my company can you come

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,079
back

00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,079
in a week and interview i'm like yes i

00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,240
can do that

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,160
which means another greyhound bus ride

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,520
so i get on the greyhound bus i go down

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,760
i start the interview they cut the

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,079
interview off early after one or two

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,839
you know interviewee interviewers and

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,599
i'm walking out of the building dejected

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,640
and i see him walking up the stairs he's

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,640
like where are you going

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,920
it's like i don't know they cut off the

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,359
interview and he's like

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,839
have you talked to so and so and i'm

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,119
like no and talk to so-and-so and he's

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,640
like come with me

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,559
and so he takes me back up and he does a

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,400
panel interview which was super fun and

00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,960
he just unilaterally hired me

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,559
and i took this super serious i'm like

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,599
this is my chance

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,319
and i worked my ass off and i did a good

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,160
job

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,839
and from that it led to other

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,400
opportunities

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:12,079
and i i started getting this reputation

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,599
of like the person you go to that's

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,720
going to work so hard they're just going

00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,040
to get it done

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,400
i was very common for me to fall asleep

00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,359
in the office because i'd spent the

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,680
entire night

00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,520
you know just trying to get this tough

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,440
problem taken care of

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,880
in fact i was taken advantage of it

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,400
quite a bit in early in my career um

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:36,000
some of these things i uh i did for like

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:39,359
12 an hour you know it was ridiculous

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,119
but it got my got me going and got my

00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,240
reputation going

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,079
then i had a huge opportunity uh

00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,280
a toy company contacted me they're like

00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,240
we saw some of the stuff that you're

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,240
doing

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,240
uh we've been trying to reverse engineer

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,000
the commodore 64 and put it all in a

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,200
joystick so you can have all of your

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,720
favorite commodore 64 games

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,920
in a little joystick you can plug into

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,119
your tv can you do an asic for us a chip

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,559
a microchip

00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,319
and i didn't know how to do a chip but i

00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:10,720
was like sure no problem

00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:12,720
and so i got to figure out how to design

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,880
this chip without ever having doing

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,400
to do one before in a very short amount

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,440
of time like eight months

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,359
so we had a team of us uh it was like

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,720
about five of us i was doing all the

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,480
hardware all the chips all the

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,240
prototypes and then we had

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,160
you know about four people working on

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,720
the software

00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,160
we were all commodore fanatics we loved

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,040
it

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,319
somehow you know more mentors entered my

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,079
life i found some

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,839
chip design mentors they helped me

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,799
through the process we got the chip done

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,520
we were late

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,880
we had to get it done for christmas so

00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:48,000
um

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,640
uh the toy company put all this faith in

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,280
me and they

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,480
ran hundreds of thousands of chips

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,240
without testing them

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,680
through the foundry millions of dollars

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,640
and then they send them to china for

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,799
assembly i get this angry phone call

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,559
after the chips get there angry new

00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,359
yorker screaming at me like these things

00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,240
don't work

00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:09,680
you need to fix it you know you cost us

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,839
millions of dollars

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,720
i was like oh crap what do i do and i

00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:17,119
was like do i run to mexico and hide

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,799
um but they threw me on a plane i went

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,400
to china

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:23,200
i got there i found out that they had

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,720
like uh redesigned my circuit board and

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,960
threw away a bunch of the components and

00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,520
it

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,200
actually worked after all uh when i was

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,440
at the factory

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,440
um we hadn't told the toy company that

00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,000
we had been adding extra stuff to this

00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,400
toy

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,680
we had gone outside the scope of the toy

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,119
and we had actually added

00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:43,680
extra games to the the system

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,119
and i also added documentation how you

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,960
could open it up and download your own

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,440
games to it and hack it

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,640
and the toy guys lost it on that they

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,240
were mad they're like you're never going

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,920
to work with us again you can't tell

00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,599
anyone about it

00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,359
so i came back to united states and i

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,520
talked to my friend who was like really

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,520
savvy about doing blogs and

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,200
things like that and he said like well

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,160
you know you've lost your chances in the

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,359
toy industry

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,880
do you want to just tell the world about

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,319
it anyway i'll make a fake blog that

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,440
makes it look like a

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,720
factory worker figured this out and

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,559
have all this back history to make it

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,520
look legit and you can get it out to the

00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,319
world

00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,160
uh yeah why not i'm done for and so he

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,920
made this fake blog he managed to get it

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,559
on the front page of

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,400
slashdot which was popular at the time

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,280
and this particular toy was being sold

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,440
through qvc

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,960
sold to grandma's and grandpas and it

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,200
wasn't being promoted as

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,079
like a retro throwback thing it was more

00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,280
of a

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,359
a get it for your grandkids type thing

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,760
and uh it was on this home shopping

00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:46,720
network called qvc

00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,440
and uh when it launched they sold out in

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,440
a week

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,799
and qvc was calling up the toy company

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,400
like what's going on

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,079
why are these things going around the

00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,720
world um like 50

00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,599
of them are going to you know non-united

00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,599
states

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,920
addresses and that was my first

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,400
experience with viral marketing

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,000
oh geez i'm running out of time can i go

out

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,440
uh it was super interesting i had never

me people were trying to find me they

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,640
were calling my father

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,640
my friends were sending me screenshots

00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,079
of google analytics saying that i

00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,960
um i'm the number i beat santa claus

00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,240
in search results on google things like

00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,359
that it was crazy

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:54,799
um made me very uncomfortable and

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,319
at the time but that

00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:58,400
launched my career into some pretty

00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,599
amazing things i worked on

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,839
all kinds of things like video

telepresence

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,040
devices lots of toys got to work some of

00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,880
at new tech one of the companies that

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,760
you know was like a dream company when i

00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,280
was a kid

00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,960
on the amiga and uh really opened a lot

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,760
of doors there's so many stories i could

00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,960
tell about

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,960
you know startup life

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,160
in the meantime i started a company i

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,559
mean

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,599
a company a youtube channel where i

00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,000
started giving back

00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:32,240
um so i tried to mentor virtually and so

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,400
i started doing hundreds and hundreds of

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,079
videos about hardcore science and

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,559
putting them up free on youtube this was

00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,720
like super early in the youtube days

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,760
um had a lot of fun got a lot of

00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,440
attention with that

00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,440
met a lot of great people like in the

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,240
upper left corner is

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,000

00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,760
together she does this meta picture we

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,240
take pictures of each other

00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,760
when we go to events like maker faire i

00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,680
got to show the world

00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,079
like things like how you could do

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,200
microchips in your garage or do electron

00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,160
microscopy

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,359
and and because of this youtube channel

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,839
a company

00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,599
called valve software started recruiting

00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,760
me very aggressively

00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,280
i was very happy at my current uh gig

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,799
that i was doing

company flew down to portland

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,520
and took me out to lunch and he's like

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,880
hey you know this is serious i really

00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,680
want you to come up and just meet the

00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,160
team will you just

00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,599
indulge me and come up for an afternoon

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,559
and i'm like okay i'll fly up for an

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,640
afternoon

00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,559
he promised me that it wasn't an

00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,160
interview and that was a complete lie

00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,920
because as soon as i got there they

00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,440
stopped me in a conference room

00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,040
another panel interview which i love

00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,720
them but it was like a whole room of

01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,920
people like rapid fire like

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,440
all right we're going to make a game

01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,240
console how do you do it and i'd be like

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,920
oh i'd go to this oem

01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,760
like it was a really fun riffing session

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,599
and i swear he must have done some kind

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,440
of nose signal and then everyone just

01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,119
got up out of the room and left

01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,720
and he said come with me jerry and he

01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,040
took me down

01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,240
to the fourth floor of the sky that

01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,319
building that they're in

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,440
and he's like this whole fourth floor is

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,760
yours

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,720
hire whoever you want bring all the best

01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,200
people in

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,280
this is what i want you to do he's like

01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,000
i want you to make a gaming system that

01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,599
brings

01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,680
everyone together in the families

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,040
they're playing games together in the

01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,799
living room

01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,240
it's like does that sound interesting

01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,480
unlimited budget

01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,240
like oh my goodness i don't know like

01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,240
you're springing this on me

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:54,960
and then you're like well can you stay

01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,400
overnight and think about it and we'll

01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,359
talk to you about it more tomorrow and

01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,839
i'm like well i didn't bring any

01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,400
toiletries i didn't bring any clothes

01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,559
he's like oh we'll take care of that so

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,240
they took me down to their swag room

01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,319
and started giving me like valve

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,119
t-shirts and then they drove me by like

01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,960
stores so i could get like underwear and

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,040
toothbrushes and stuff and

01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,000
i came back the next day wearing like a

01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,760
left 4 dead

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,720
valve shirt or something it was

01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,240
hilarious and how could i say no to that

01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,480
and so that was amazing i put together

01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,720
this dream team we started researching

01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,559
everything about games we hooked people

01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,119
up to electrodes and we read their

01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,520
emotions we fed it into games

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,880
to see if we could make games more fun

01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,880
we read people's

01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,240
you know facial expressions with cameras

01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,440
and fed that into games

01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:44,000
and we made alternate controllers we did

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,760
we we seeded all of the virtual reality

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,440
stuff out there like oculus guys were

01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,599
coming through learning from us how to

01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,200
build virtual reality systems

01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,640
but that's where i got the augmented

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,480
reality bug i invented

01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,480
an optical technique there trying to

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,799
make an ar system

01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,160
that turned the optics inside out so you

01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:03,839
could use a game board

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:05,440
to do augmented reality so you can open

01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,720
up this game board on your table and

01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,240
play a game

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,160
and it was super popular people would

01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,720
come through and play on my ar system

01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,799
for hours

01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,319
we had a whole team around it but valve

01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,200
decided that they didn't want to go down

01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,359
this path

01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,359
their internal dna was just too strong

01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,440
for hardcore games and so

01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,960
they proceeded with doing a vr system

01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,119
called htc vive

01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,160
um based on a bunch of stuff that we all

01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,400
worked on

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,160
uh so i found myself outside of valve

01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,640
with a bunch of the ar folks and we

01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,640
started a company called cast ar

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,079
uh and i actually bought the technology

01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,680
from gabe newell

01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,680
uh it's kind of funny the day that i

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,559
went to talk to him after um being let

01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,240
go i'm like

01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,079
first i was going to go chew him out for

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,160
it but that didn't last you know i got

01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,720
emotional about 30 seconds into it i'm

01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,079
oh

01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,839
i can't believe you're killing my

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,559
project it's so good it does exactly

01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:53,119
what you say

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,480
you can play ar on the table and it

01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,079
brings people together and

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,440
yeah the best thing i ever said during

01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,720
that meeting was like you should just

01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,920
sell it to me

01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,520
and he said sure and you know i took a

01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,880
lot of lawyers and stuff but we ended up

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,880
buying the technology for a hundred

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,480
dollars and starting this company

01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,240
and so rick and i and some of the other

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,839
folks we spent like six months

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,839
bootstrapping this company and we got

01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:16,079
prototypes going they were kind of rough

01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:19,440
at first and they got better and better

01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:22,559
and we got the company off the ground

01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,400
and things were looking really good

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,160
i started making a bunch of mistakes at

01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,079
this point

01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,520
i was scared i didn't know how to run a

01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,359
venture-backed company

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,559
i'd never done it before i'd never been

01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:35,599
a ceo before

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,280
so i started outsourcing those tasks all

01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,079
the management of the company which was

01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,880
a huge

01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,599
mistake you know the visionary of the

01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,839
company should

01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,520
never hand the keys over to somebody

01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,760
else and i learned the hard way

01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,039
and then we raised a bunch of money

01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,440
virtual reality was hot

01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,400
augmented reality is hot andy rubin from

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,640
uh

01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,839
google came in and just gave us 15

01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,200
million dollars

01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:00,559
and over funded the company and that's

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,400
when things started really going

01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,319
sideways with it we lost focus

01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,760
on tabletop gaming we started uh

01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,760
being pushed in all these different

01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,680
directions like medical imaging and

01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,559
military and just all these

01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,200
crazy things instead of staying focused

01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,000
and then

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:22,720
came the constant stream of celebrity

01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,079
executives and executives out of big

01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,400
companies that just got

01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,359
installed into my company i found myself

01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,960
for the last

01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,160
like year and a half of the company just

01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,680
kind of sitting in the corner they

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,359
didn't want anything to do with my

01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,440
input and they were just running the

01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:38,960
company and sure enough

01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,000
the the company creates a huge crater in

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,400
the ground uh

01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,160
they they burn through all the money you

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,760
know doing all kinds of crazy things

01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,720
like paying expensive

01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,000
wages to the executives and bringing in

01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,319
firms to like

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,200
you know change the color of the glasses

01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,960
and and

01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,400
kind of unnecessary stuff instead of

01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,480
just shipping the first product

01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,480
it was really sad i was devastated

01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,359
and i'm sitting in the office by myself

01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,200
after laying off about 70 people

01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,599
um and i'm sitting in office and out of

01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,319
the blue i get a phone call

01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,680
from nolan bushnell the founder of atari

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:16,559
i'd maybe met him once

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,720
i didn't even know he knew who i was and

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:21,119
somehow he had found my phone number

01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,000
and he's like jerry i'm a big fan i've

01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,920
been watching you for

01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,680
years i love what you're doing this is

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,680
going to be a game changer

01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,520
you know it's sad and i could see with

01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,160
all these executives coming in

01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,440
and you losing control that this was not

01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,079
going to end well

01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,880
he's like i don't know exactly how to

01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,280
tell you

01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,799
to fix this but i just want to tell you

01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,680
if you want this to happen

01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:44,799
there's a way just go figure it out and

01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,440
so

01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:49,200
i went to all my mentors and and

01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,240
everyone i started asking like

01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,720
can i make this work somehow it's such a

01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,520
great

01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,799
product and i started working closely

01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,119
with my mentors

01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,920
and they told me like you know you can

01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,160
actually buy

01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,599
all this technology back at the after

01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,640
the end of the company it'll just go

01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,920
up for auction and so a group of us got

01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,000
together and that's what we did we

01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,480
bought the technology

01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,079
and uh we started bootstrapping the

01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,559
company again but this time with

01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,799
extreme focus and we spent months and

01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,960
months we didn't even

01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,039
you know start hiring people or try to

01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,599
raise money we just wanted to make sure

01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,559
we had

01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,400
charted a very clear course of how we

01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,160
were going to be successful

01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,599
and mean that in the meantime to

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,880
bootstrap the company i

01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,960

01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,839
was a lifelong dream i mean i'm a child

01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,119
of the 80s

01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:44,480
the space shuttle haley's comment like

01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,480
i love space and so a friend of mine

01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,920
called me up and he's like hey i'm a ceo

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,880

space company um i want you to come up

01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,000

01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,160
no no i can't do that i'm bootstrapping

01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,240
my company and he's like

01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,559
you're the only guy the only person i

01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,480

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,039
me

01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,559
and so he was i mean living in silicon

01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,400
valley at the time and he's up in

01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,079
alameda which is a little north of um

01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,079
the center of silicon valley

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,200
go on to this naval base i walk in the

01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,599
door and i see

01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,559
this rocket laying horizontally on the

01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,119
in this

01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,559
facility i'm like holy cow that thing's

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,720
so cool

01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,079
and he's leading me around the uh the

01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,839
facility and he's like

01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,520
yeah the guy that was doing our flight

01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,440
computers left they're not

01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,640
done we don't think they're even

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,119
remotely close

01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,280
like you need to save us i'm like i

01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,079
can't i can't i'm starting my company

01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,920
he's like

01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,440
well here come take a look at this and

01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,000
so in this facility

01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,200
it was an old jet engine testing

01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,359
facility

01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,799
they actually had these giant rocket

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:56,160
motors set up

01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:58,720
in these test cells he's like you want

01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,200
to push the fire button

01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,480
yes so they count down lets me push the

01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,520
fire button

01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,359
and the fire starts shooting out of this

01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,200
this jet engine i mean this rocket

01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:10,000
engine and the ground shaking and i'm

01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,119
like

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,960
ah damn it uh

01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,960
it's like i i have to get the company

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,600
going in like five months so

01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,960
i'll help you but it's got to be done in

01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,239
in this amount of time he's like i'll

01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,759
take it

01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:28,799
and so wow it was like

01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,880
an amazing compressed timeline

01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,799
but um i worked with a really tiny team

01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,640
mostly software folks we built the

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,560
flight computers and the telemetry

01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,640
system i did all the hardware on it

01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,159
um on the uh the computers all the

01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,640
radios and we

01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:44,239
we got it going and i took it up to

01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,040
alaska and

01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,239
and and launched it and then i i was

01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,239
like

01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:54,560
like i'm done here uh but

01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:56,400
this is what it did the first uh two

01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,000
times that they launched it

01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:03,679
happy to say it was never a software or

01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,120
you know electrical problem but uh

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:08,719
eventually they did get it

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,880
oh wait i put this picture you got to

01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,120
see this this is what happens to a

01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,759
flight computer when it's ejected from

01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,520
a rocket that it has an unscheduled

01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,440
disassembly

01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,600
this was picked up like a mile away from

01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,520
the rocket and literally all the chips

01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,880
had fallen off of the part off the

01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:30,080
board and the uh the board is

01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,120
massively warped it's incredible

01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,199
but they did it rocket three

01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,400
has a little my dna in it and they made

01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,640
it to space so

01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,000
wow dream come true i don't think i

01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,359
would ever do that again

01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
it's so hard to work with the faa and

01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,000
the launch facilities but this gave me

01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,560
enough time and enough time for our team

01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,359
to work and we got till five off the

01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,799
ground

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,880
a lot of people ask us what the name

01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,159
tilt five stands for and we can never

01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,640
tell you

01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,719
this partly is an inside joke because at

01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,800
my previous company cast ar

01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,239
the executives wanted to rename the

01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,000
company about five times

01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,760
and they paid a lot of money to rename

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,800
it and so we just chose a name that

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,960
makes us laugh

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,400
and we don't care what people think i'm

01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,640
the ceo this time

01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,320
i'm driving the vision of the company

01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,320
our goal is to

01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,360
bring people together in the living room

01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,840
sound familiar

01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,199
playing games grandma grandpa down to

01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,040
the grandkids

01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,800
our system is the ar glasses that you

01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,360
slip on they have a massive field of

01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,040
view

01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,880
so when you flip open the game board

01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,719
this magical world just springs out in

01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,400
front of you

01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,880
it allows multiple players to play

01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,520
together you can play board games and

01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,320
you can play traditional video games so

01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,159
if you've been hungry to play video

01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,360
games together

01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:47,760
you know you don't have to play

01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,719
multiplayer games apart anymore you can

01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,560
play it together

01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,239
on our system you can look across the

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,120
table your friends as you're playing the

01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:56,239
game it's

01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:59,199
magical this time we're super focused

01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:00,719
games games games and the other thing i

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,640
learned from my previous startup was we

01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,880
were way too focused on

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,440
the technology we were so excited about

01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,360
the plastic and the sensors and the

01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,480
the images and things like that and we

01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,719
forgot that we have to go get a lot of

01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,880
games on the system and so

01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:18,640
you know most of our work is actually

01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,880
going out and working with third-party

01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,640
developers to have dozens and dozens of

01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,080
games and just a constant

01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,239
flow of games of all types and so it's

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,440
so delightful for me like three years

01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,440
after such a traumatic

01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,960
event that we're now building these

01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,520
glasses and they're

01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,719
going out to real users and developers

01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,480
and we get to

01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,800
play test all these games and there's

01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:43,840
just this constant stream of

01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,960
rts's and board games and action games

01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,120
and puzzle games

01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,440
single player multiplayer it's like a

01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,480
dream control that true this is like

01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,679
this is the thing i dreamed about you

01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,640
know since the

01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,760
early 80s when i saw star wars and and

01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,440
hollow chess

01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,000
or the star wars chess so

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,480
anyway i know i've gone over my time i

01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,880
should

01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,800
probably put a pin in it here um feel

01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,880
free to visit

01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,280
tilt5.com and also

01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,159
all of our development until 5 is on

01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,280
linux

01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:21,840
our glasses also run on linux

01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,280
that's the everything gets tested on

01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,520
linux first

01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,320
so uh this audience is probably going to

01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,360
be pretty happy about that

01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,000
i don't know if we have time for

01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:34,800
questions i went a little over

01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,920
thank you very much cherry you did it

01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,280
thank

01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,880
go a bit over time but the audience here

01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:45,600
was very vocal that you should

01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,600
go over so we should

01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,360
stop it even if we wanted to and

01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,320
also judging by your whole story would

01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,480
really a clock

01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,640
stop you no no that's that is

01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,600
you know that's my whole story right

01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,600
it's like

01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,360
people tell me i can't do something like

01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,320
i can't race cars i mean the number of

01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,640
people told me

01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,719
when i was like 16 year old years old

01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,840
you can't raise cars that just emboldens

01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,280
me to do it

01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,920
or even with cast ar when it failed

01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,960
like i got so much negative press like

01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,679
she's a loser

01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,880
she failed she couldn't do it it was

01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,560
just like

01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,960
and then i just had this catalyst of

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,520
like this industry legend saying you can

01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,400
do it

01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,000
and that's like yeah i can do this and

01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,080
you know that kind of

01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,760
energy and having those mentors around

01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,440
you to support you

01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,840
you know is how you get through the low

01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,840
points

01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,080
in fact one of the one of the question

01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,080
was not a question was like

01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:46,000
uh saying not a question just really

01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,600
shared that i really really loved your

01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,640
talk thank you and that's more or less

01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,199
the general mood from the thank you

01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,840
but we have some questions so maybe we

01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,360
can

01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:00,400
go at least with one or two let's see

01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:02,800
that'd be awesome i appreciate it

01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,400
marco is asking today electronics are

01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,320
more styled to tinkering

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,679
on the other hand online resources to

01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,760
learn are awesome

01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,440
do you think today today environment is

01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,679
more or less stimulating for young

01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,960
people to think

01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,719
i would have died to have

01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,440
the world wide web and all these

01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:23,360
resources i can't even imagine

01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,800
how much further i could have gone in my

01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,840
career if i would have had those

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:30,719
resources i am so envious

01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,960
about you know a kid that's 12 year old

01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,880
years old today that can get online and

01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,480
start learning about whatever science

01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,880
and technology or art

01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,239
that they want to you know back in my

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,280
day like

01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:45,040
to to get a data sheet for a chip

01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,360
i would have to get on the phone and

01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,440
pretend that i was a secretary

01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,640
for an engineer because that's all i

01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,159
could pass off as

01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,800
and then i would try to convince them we

01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:58,080
were a real company and have them try to

01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,760
try to get them to ship ship me a data

01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,320
sheet or a sample part

01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,440
to this like po dunk little town out in

01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,040
the middle of nowhere

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,719
and sometimes it worked and most the

01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,960
time it didn't

01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,840
now you can just like all these

01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,840
resources is great

01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,760
yeah it's totally totally different um

01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,080
there is another question which i think

01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,480
you kind of answer but just to be sure

01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,080
uh will we be able to get the tilt fight

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,080
losses and wants

01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,000
working with linux will we have an api

01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,560
to develop with it

01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,719
all right my co-founder always wants me

01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,280
to

01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,800
qualify this so there's so many variants

01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,719
of linux so

01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,560
you know it has to kind of fit with what

01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,280
we're the current

01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,159
um version of linux we're using in the

01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,840
office

01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:48,480
so most of our develop most of the folks

01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:51,920
are using ubuntu 20.

01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,760
i've used it on the latest drop of kde

01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:57,040
so that's good news

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,800
um so i suspect you know it's those two

01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,440
are so close

01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,920
but you know i'm so impressed with the

01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,480
ui

01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,320
you know i'm a what they call an

01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,600
appliance user

01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:11,679
right i'm not a hardcore linux user

01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,679
although i have a lot of stories about

01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,159
actually did the configurations for this

01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,679
rocket

01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,280
and linux on that and i have like an

01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:20,320
entire i could do an hour about

01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:23,600
uh interesting linux and rocketry

01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,600
stuff but that's for another time

01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,280
i do appreciate since like half my tools

01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,000
are on windows i just have to use them

01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,159
on windows

01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,679
that the kde environment feels so

01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,880
familiar to me it's

01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,239
i like it better than just the default

01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,159
ubuntu

01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:41,600
installs and that kind of answer also

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,360
the other question which was

01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,440
how are you finding the kde plasma

01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,640
desktop and what this draw

01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,400
are you running so i guess it was the

01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,920
latest and greatest let's see uh

01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,920
about let's see

01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:00,560
it is plasma 5.21.4

01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,239
okay think that's the latest and

01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,640
greatest

01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:08,400
almost the latest but that's really a

01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,640
matter of a few days so that's

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,199
kind of still the the latest from the

01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,800
practical point of view so

01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,560
here on my workbench i actually hooked

01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,920
it up to all my ham radio gear i'm a ham

01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,360
radio operator

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,280
and so you know using uh

01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,360
linux and ham radio is not for the faint

01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,800
of heart but i did get everything

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,960
working on linux and so

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,719
i'm windows free now on my ham radio

01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,640
configuration so it's pretty cool i can

01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,920
control my radios from

01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,920
the um desktop

01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,719
that's very very nice to hear i know

01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,560
there are a lot of radio projects so

01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:47,120
that's good

01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,400
they are working properly okay there are

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,760
no other questions

01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:54,480
so i guess we are at the end of the talk

01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,480
it was so fun i really really appreciate

01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,360
letting me come and

01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:02,320
tell my long windy story i hope people

01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,320
didn't get too bored

01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,360
they were ready to stay more yeah but

01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,719
the chat is

01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:13,199
already already

01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,960
uploading and happy when you said that

01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,719
you have a side story about linux in

01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,280
rockets that could take another hour i

01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,360
i'm sure

01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,360
everyone was speaking for that

01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,000
i should probably wait until um astra

01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,880
that's the name of the rocket company

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,520
is uh taken over and uh spacex is no

01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,080
longer

01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,280
and there's no sensitive information but

01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,920
it it was super

01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,440
interesting uh device trees the first

01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,239
time i've had to do that because we were

01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,920
making custom hardware it's like oh fun

01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:44,560
times

01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,679
sorry for next time perhaps yes yes

01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,960
anytime you want me

01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:51,040
i'll i'll be here

01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,199
okay thank you again very much thank you

01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:57,679
luigi for handling the questions

01:18:53,199 --> 01:19:00,719
and i guess this is the end of our

01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:04,000
of our track here

01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:06,560
so i'll do some uh

01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:16,960
housekeeping i guess to announce what's

01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:16,960
