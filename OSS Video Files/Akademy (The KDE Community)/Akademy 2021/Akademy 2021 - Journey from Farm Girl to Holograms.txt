Description: 
	By Jeri Ellsworth
Jeri Ellsworth shares her journey as lifelong inventor, entrepreneur and maker. The journey from farm girl to holograms is not without its ups and downs. She will share how obstacles were overcome through courage, persistence, and a inquisitiveness about how the world works. Some stories feature Jeri's mentors who were critical to achieving success, whether it was to design the best toy that could delight millions of kids or how to become lead avionics engineer for a low earth orbit rocket. Jeri's current startup is the culmination of an 8-year quest – including a nearly $2million Kickstarter campaign – to bring holograms affordably into every home, called Tilt Five.
