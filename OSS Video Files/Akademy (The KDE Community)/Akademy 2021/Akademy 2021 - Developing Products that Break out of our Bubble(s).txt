Title: Akademy 2021 - Developing Products that Break out of our Bubble(s)
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By  Neofytos Kolokotronis
KDE develops software products used daily by millions of people. Some are expected to be used by a generic pool of users, others are intended for specific groups. Yet, all of them certainly have the potential to reach even more users.
In this talk I will present the various levels of bubbles that our products need to break out from, in order to grow their userbase. I am going to explore KDE applications that are already doing amazingly well, take a look at those that can be considered as great candidates to travel outside our orbit, and provide some tips on how we can enable more of our apps to achieve greatness.

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,280
good thanks adam

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
so i'm nervous

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,640
for those of you that don't know me um

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,720
i've been a contributor to kde for a

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
couple of years now and in the last two

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,240
years i've been a leader of the

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,480
kde board where i mostly handle

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,800
communicate community and organizational

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,800
issues

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
for my in my day job part of my day job

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,200
at least is

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,120
working and running with innovation

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,239
programs where i help

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,360
startups getting their ideas into

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,760
prototypes and into mvps and they can

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
then

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
take out the market and if things go

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,399
well then they can

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,359
go start fundraising so this is part of

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,640
my inspiration for choosing this topic

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,680
and also another part of why i chose

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
this topic is

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
because i see more and more of our

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,080
products growing

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,680
and many potential candidates to best

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
out of the kitty bubble because out of

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
the

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,439
foss linux tech ecosystem bubble which

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
is great and i think we have a lot of

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,560
potential ahead

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,280
uh going forward so we may be

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
talking about three things in the stock

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,000
products

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
try to define them and figure them a bit

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
out

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,479
bubbles what they are how i see them

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,400
working in kde and our ecosystem

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,479
and then trying to figure out ways that

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,040
we can break out of them

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,399
moving forward uh so let's get started

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,560
um so products first um

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
depending on where you stand and what

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,880
percent perspective you take

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
there are various let's say definitions

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,600
of products

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
across the web i chose the one from the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,200
scrum guide

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
because it's closer to what we do

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
software development

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,479
and delivering this kind of products so

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,680
in the scan right a product

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,080
is defined as a vehicle to deliver

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
value so you're developing something

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,319
that intent

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,760
uh is useful to someone out there

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,480
um so to further define that a product

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,840
needs to have

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,879
clear boundaries so it's not something

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,440
random and that keeps changing

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,040
it has non-stakeholders people working

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,599
on it people interested in it

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,800
and it has a well-defined type of user

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,319
or customer

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,800
if you're selling that now on the

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,920
nature of the product it could be a

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
software application

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
as we develop it could be a service that

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,920
you offer

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,560
it could be a physical product maybe a

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
phone

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,480
a laptop in our case or it's something

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,000
even more abstract

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,400
so it can get various

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
uh characteristics depending on how you

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,920
approach it

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,440
um trying now to narrow it down a bit in

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
kd's case

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
what we say are our products this is

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
what i came up with

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,040
feel free to share in the chat if

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,599
something i missed or

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,599
you thought of something else for

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,200
example we have applications lots and

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,319
lots of applications

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,920
some of them we group them into into

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,799
groups uh kdgear comes to mind

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,480
gear mobile also so those can be

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,040
considered to some extent products on

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
their own as groups we have things like

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,000
the framework so

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,360
development frameworks uh package of

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,599
uh frameworks to uh

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,440
that help developers and are targeted at

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,200
them we have things like

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,519
the plasma and plasma mobile

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
environments that are a specific niche

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
of their own

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,680
um we have of course hardware devices

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
like phones and laptops that we

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
get to the market through our

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
partnerships with other organizations

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,280
and companies

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,120
and we also offer a wide variety of

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
services we might not be developing

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,360
these products but we do offer them to

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,720
users and they will come to us about

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
issues they have with them

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
or the experience with them like these

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,000
big loop atom instance like we have

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,199
gitlab on event

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,440
we have the matrix chat um

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,600
survey so all these are in some way

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,720
things we offer to our community

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,040
and uh arguably you can also include

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,960
events in these type of products

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,280
academy last our major flagship events

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,639
are things that we could be thinking as

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
a product because

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
we have sponsors for them we have users

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,320
for them we have people that

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,800
are watching and find value in the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
participating so these are the various

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
products

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
you can already see that we have a wide

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
range of

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
products and types of products in kde

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,120
and

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,759
this is very good but also challenging

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
um trying to figure out how to approach

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,400
this i came across

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,039
this complete product experience as

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,880
brian they have calls it in his book so

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,120
i think it's valuable and

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,400
you can see here the various sections

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,960
that are involved

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
in developing a product in a more

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,280
complete way

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,800
we have marketing we have sales we have

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,400
technology behind the product we have

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
all the supporting systems that help

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
deliver

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,880
this product to to the

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,960
users we have all the third-party

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
integrations that our product needs to

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,720
work with

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,960
we have the support for our users

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
policies of course that

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,479
define how we develop our product and

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,160
how do we deliver our product

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,680
we will get into a bit more details into

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
the next section of this presentation to

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,280
try and figure out

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:57,520
what each of these involves

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,919
so let's moving into the bubbles

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
what's a bubble now a bubble as you know

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,160
might mean a number of things but

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,759
in the way we use it in this

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,199
presentation

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,680
it can be these two definitions that i

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
chose

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
one is it can be a situation in which

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
you only experience things

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,160
that you expect or find easy to deal

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,520
with so let's say familiar place

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,440
that you are accustomed to and

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
it can also be a group of people who

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
have a lot of contact and interact with

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,319
each other

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,319
they have maybe similar views or at

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,800
least they align on some aspects

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,160
but this group of people have has

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,319
limited contact with people

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
outside this group so they interact a

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,120
lot with each other they do things a lot

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,919
a lot of things together

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
but they don't uh interact with other

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,880
groups

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,080
so these are the two definitions of

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,280
bible that i find

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
are relevant to what we do to what we do

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
in this talk here

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
so trying to figure out the bubbles that

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
are involved in what we do as a

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
community in skd

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,960
uh i came up with this if i missed

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
something or

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,479
you find something else again feel free

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,759
to share it

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,080
i'll be happy to discuss more on it so

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
i guess most projects start from a

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,160
single person

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,960
or that decides to work on something

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
then this grows into a team or they

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,080
might sometimes start as a team as well

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,759
as some people gather together and

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,240
decide to work on things

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,479
then this team grows into a community

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,960
for the purpose of this talk i put kde

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,080
here but this can be any major community

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
around the product

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,880
what i i mean by a community is that you

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,400
know start having multiple teams

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,240
around uh around the products and

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,479
working each other developing products

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
in parallel on various fronts

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,400
they need to come together under one

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
umbrella so

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
for our best boss this up realize kde

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
and depending on your

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,360
use case it can be something else then

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,479
outside of kde we have the whole

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,520
open source ecosystem this can be uh

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,319
this can be uh all

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,479
all of our network that involves the

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
tech community the linux baby community

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
the open source community in general and

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,000
of course the big bubble

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,199
that we all want to break out from is to

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,840
go out and reach the wider world um

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
i guess part of the values of doing open

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,879
source is about

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,560
reaching and bringing the advantages of

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
it into

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
the wider community into the whole world

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,440
so

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,159
uh these are the five bubbles that i

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,159
will take into consideration for the uh

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
for the next slides and for the next

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,880
part of my presentation

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,800
so let's quickly go over a few of

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,480
these bubbles and see what they look

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
like and what are the major challenges

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
that

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,200
i at least thought about um

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,120
so when you are working solely uh you're

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
most likely scratching your niche

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,640
and you're developing maybe in a long

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,080
time way you are

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,080
developing by yourself um a product or

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,000
an application or something

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
that you work on because you want to

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
solve something

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,279
for yourself um the good thing about

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,279
this is that

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,360
it is a major advantage i see is that

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,920
it's easier and faster to make decisions

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,040
implement

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,760
changes in all the development is just

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,120
yourself and your product and you grow

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,440
it the way you like

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
um of course there are some challenges

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
here because

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
you're alone so there's always the fast

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
factor if something happens to you your

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,040
product

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,440
is is probably dead or if you have

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
public slices somewhere maybe somebody

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
picks it up but

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,399
it depends on the work we have done to

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,959
get this product out and

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,560
more people to learn about it so that's

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,240
an issue your product is still not

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,920
independent from you

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
another issue is quality if you are

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,680
working alone there's not many eyes

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,320
looking at your code recommending

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,959
changes

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,600
improvements and things like that so uh

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
that

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,200
might be also an issue as your product

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,240
grows and of course you have limited

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
resources because

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,920
it's just you there are so many certain

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,040
things that you can do within your day

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,399
in your time

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,800
so that's also a limitation now as you

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,920
grow

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
and you manage to attract people around

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,880
your products

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,920
and yourself maybe if you're the main

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
maintainer

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
you need you start basically building a

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
team

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,360
um this brings many positives with it

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,959
for example every new team member will

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
probably bring their own

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,120
additional skills that might vary from

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
yours or they can be similar to yours

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,720
but from a different perspective

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
or maybe they can be dropping

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,000
replacements for you which increases the

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,600
factor you also now have more resources

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
that become available

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,720
so you can utilize those in order to

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,839
grow your products

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
um you now need to start thinking about

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
relationships

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
building relationships between people

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
handling relationships between people

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,800
and you also start

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
need to start thinking about

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,519
communicating between the team and how

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
you set up the proper channels in order

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,360
to achieve that

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,560
um of course all this brings with it an

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,920
increased potential

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,920
for your project to grow even further

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,560
the challenges here is that

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,320
new people they do bring skills and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,160
resources in but they also bring their

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
own ideas and their own demands

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,399
so as people contribute more and more to

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
your product project they want to have a

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
say

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,079
in the decision making they will be

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,000
proposing things

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,240
they will be demanding things from you

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,160
so this changes a bit the balance

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,240
of the processes um this is why you need

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
to start defining these processes

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,760
how you make decisions how you

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,640
collaborate on code

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,279
how you get things out to users and in

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,959
public so all these processes need to

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,760
be start need to start being refined

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,880
and of course as your team grows you

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
need to start thinking about

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,440
collaboration

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,079
how to grow to set up proper

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
infrastructure so you can collaborate

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,680
on various sugars these are usually

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,440
simple in the beginning but

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,480
as you grow bigger they get complicated

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,279
so coming now back to the community

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
aspect of it

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,680
uh in the case of kde what does it looks

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,200
like what does it look like

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,360
um so if you have reached this stage

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
of having uh let's say an umbrella

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
community

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,240
uh for your products then you're

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,360
probably part of an organization

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
like kitty like edv that can support you

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,720
and your product when i say organization

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,160
it doesn't have to be necessarily a

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,800
legal organization but

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,600
it's a structure that has specific

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
processes

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,120
specific procedures rules and all sorts

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,800
of things

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,079
so for this kind of complexity to work

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,560
you need to have this set in place so

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,240
uh at the same time you'll get lots of

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,519
support from other team members from

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
other community members

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
uh and especially from other specialized

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,480
teams

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
that are around would be looking on how

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
kde through its specialized teams can

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,800
help your product

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,000
uh at the next uh section of this

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,519
presentation

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,279
um also usually in this kind of uh

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
of communities there will be

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,079
infrastructure in place that can help

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,200
you scale

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,760
so other people will be working for you

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,440
in order to have things in place that

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,000
will help you grow

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
and of course it's a very good

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,360
opportunity because

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
usually these communities will ship

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,760
products in a more generic way

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
it's it's much easier for you to get

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
your product by default

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,839
into more distribution channels maybe

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,720
it's if there are maybe

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,160
distributions like oss they can ship

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
your product together

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,199
if you choose so the challenges here are

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,079
of course as i mentioned before

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,600
the complexity increases a lot you need

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
to start abiding by

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,920
community rules you need to follow the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,000
procedures not set by you anymore

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,519
but from the wider community you cannot

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
can of course affect them

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,920
and work to change them but still you

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,160
need to do it in the spirit of the whole

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,639
community so you need to be using

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
uh specific tools as well that the

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,560
community has already chosen

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,320
maybe this will also

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,160
expose you to criticism when it's

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,880
increasing like evaluation

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,720
from the other teams so if you're

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,399
working with other teams it means that

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,160
their teams might have a say on the way

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,639
you do things in your own team

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,079
and they might uh propose different ways

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
of doing things they might say this is

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,920
wrong or this is right

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,800
and things like that and a major

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,519
challenge to grow

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,440
outside of this bubble of uh let's say

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,560
the community of the kde

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,320
community is like getting users from

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,760
non-kde focus systems or ecosystems so

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,199
people outside of our bubble uh to use

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,320
products that are in kde so this will

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,959
get you into the next uh bubble

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,199
where people that are not maybe

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,959
enthusiasts of kde products or maybe

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
adopters of a kd product

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,199
in general will start using them so now

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,680
you have breaking into the

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,680
open source ecosystem maybe linux if you

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,040
want to call it ecosystem

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,760
in general here you will find a growing

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,959
community

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,000
of users and contributors that you can

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,920
leverage to your advantage you will have

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,040
much more increased visibility in the

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,759
force ecosystem

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
you might have people uh reaching out to

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,100
you

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,560
you might have um

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,120
[Music]

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,880
you might be featured in various uh tech

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,600
news sites and things like that

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,800
um this usually means that your project

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
now starts

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,360
not being maybe a playground

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,120
um so this means you need to take it a

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,040
bit more seriously when you are under

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,480
the umbrella of maybe one organization

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,880
one community

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,639
you could maybe not treat it so

00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
seriously or maybe not putting so much

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,560
effort

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
now you're exposed to the whole

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,639
ecosystem you have

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
uh people coming to you with questions

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,120
with demands and things like that

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,839
uh also this increases the possibility

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,839
for

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,519
new sponsors new fundraising to take

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,959
place because now you have

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,399
all the false ecosystem available to you

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,800
and what are the main challenges here as

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
we saw earlier the need for integration

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,639
so

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
if you're working with the whole

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
ecosystem you now need to actually be

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
working with the whole ecosystem and the

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
products it develops

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,279
so you need to start thinking about how

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,040
you can integrate with other products

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,720
with other desktop environments with

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,480
other distributions

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,240
with other platforms uh so this is uh

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,079
this is an important thing to take in

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
mind as you will be getting requests to

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,199
get your product on this

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,680
or that platform

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,839
another important challenge is to get

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
your product to ship by default

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,759
in many of these distribution channels

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,839
so get your product included

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
in maybe a distribution or get your

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,680
product included into a store

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
or things like that where people would

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,280
be exposed to it without maybe knowing

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,360
too much about your product but that

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,000
would be a good opportunity to learn

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,799
um and of course through this you also

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
need to

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,400
increase your distribution challenge as

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,039
i mentioned to get your product in more

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,640
places

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,400
where people can download it

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,240
so if you manage to break out of that

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,959
bubble then you now have the world

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
at your feet what does it mean it means

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,919
that you have a

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
leading class in a way potential for

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,559
growth

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,679
you can grow exponentially as users now

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,000
don't have to be maybe

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,840
technically oriented users don't have to

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
be fuzz oriented they don't have to be

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,960
open source

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
enthusiasts for example they might just

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,240
be enjoying what you do

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
and don't know anything about the false

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,840
background behind this

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,280
so uh your your opportunity to grow now

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,200
it's huge um you ask your product now is

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,799
part of the market is part of the whole

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
market of applications and other

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,440
products that are

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,840
uh in the wild so you you

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
you are in a direct competition with

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
them which can be

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
good and a bad thing but it will

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,440
definitely help if you

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,440
approach it that way it will help you

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
grow and improve

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,440
uh there are increased opportunities

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,559
here to attract revenue so you can maybe

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,919
make your product

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,720
more sustainable and by now if you've

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,039
reached this

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,559
this stage you need you have probably

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
reached a stage where you have already

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,360
set up

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,520
maybe some sort of organizational

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,240
structure behind you

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,080
for your product specifically because

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,240
the growth for it

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,039
and its potential would probably need

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,760
this kind of packing and support

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
what are the challenges here well being

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,600
part of the

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,919
whole world is uh means the market

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,200
is that is available means that the

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
competition is fierce

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
you have to keep up with everything the

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,799
competition does

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,080
your users will be exposed to what

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,080
others are doing

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,679
and there will be a constant demand

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,520
maybe for new features

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,880
maybe for increased quality in some

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,880
aspects of your product increased

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,799
security and all those

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
topics so you need to follow the demands

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,320
of the market the demands of them

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,240
as a modern user um

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,000
something also worth considering is that

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,160
as your product growth

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,039
you probably need to start thinking that

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,280
fundraising is maybe inevitable because

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,280
it looks like it it will be a necessity

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,080
not to continue growing

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,000
um as your demands are growing and you

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,080
want to satisfy them and you want your

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,400
products to grow you probably need to

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,760
hide people to work more dedicatedly

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
on your product and of course by having

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
all this

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,160
organizational structure we discuss

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,080
about you need to start be thinking on

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,760
things like carrying the logistics

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,880
behind all these taxes

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,679
legal stuff and all that so

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280
these are major challenges but hopefully

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,039
they are good challenges because you

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,240
have reached stage now that

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,440
you can grow even further so

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,520
uh just to try and let's say

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
understand a bit better where we place

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,280
ourselves

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
um i prepared maybe this exercise to try

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,360
and figure out where

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,480
in these bubbles you probably play some

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
of our products

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
since we're already talking about the

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,280
kde community doesn't make sense talking

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,760
the team in the

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,320
solo projects but of course we have the

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
kb

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
ecosystem the first ecosystem and the

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,080
world so maybe if i can pick some of

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,760
them i will not do all of them i just

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,600
share some of them here that might fit

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,120
in these three sections feel free to

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,640
choose your own or if you are a

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,960
maintainer of an application

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
to try and start thinking about where

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,240
you fall into these

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
bubbles and if you want to move into the

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
next bubble

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,760
and which bubble would be that one so

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,880
for example we have things like

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,679
plasma that one could argue that it's

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
it's maybe grown outside of the kd

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
bubble

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,360
but maybe most of users using plasma rkd

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,039
enthusiasts anyway because they are part

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,960
of our ecosystem so

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,039
it i will place it more into kde and

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,559
listen to the false ecosystem but it's

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,559
still there and of course people in the

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,960
physical system know about it

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,880
krita as we all know has broken out of

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,360
the false ecosystem and has

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,679
is one of our many success stories and

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,120
into the world

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,039
they have users from outside of the

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,480
force ecosystem they have users that

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,000
don't know much about phos they just

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
know it's a good application and they

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
want to use it

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
which is also good and it can be an

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,559
introduction to what

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,679
is what is the first ecosystem what are

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,360
its values

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,320
and um what what are its benefits for

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,880
these users

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,640
we have things like plasma mobile that

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,159
okay it's part of the kd community but

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
it's now shifting on hardware which

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,880
means

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,159
people from the phos ecosystem are

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
buying this hardware

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,720
without necessarily buying it because it

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,080
has kde product on it

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,440
but because they're interested in the

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,400
hardware itself so i would say that

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
plasma

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,080
is starting to be more in the phos

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
ecosystem and growing and breaking out

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,000
of the kv bubble

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
as it's progressing same for the plasma

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,120
mobile apps around it

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,600
um projects maybe like scan light are

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,679
still

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
limited to the kid ecosystem things like

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
dolphin they have i think there were

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
attempts

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,919
to grow it a bit further in the past but

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,640
it's usually used by people in the

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,320
ecosystem things like heading live has

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
it seems to be having growing momentum

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,200
around it so

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,679
it has definitely breaking into the

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,080
false ecosystem bubble and it looks like

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
it's

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,280
a very good candidate to break into the

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
world uh

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,880
bubble or the world market if you want

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,520
to um

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,600
call it like that things like g company

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,400
we know it's being used in schools in

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,080
india from children and educators so it

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,240
has already broken out of the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,600
of the fossil system and into the world

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
so

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,640
more and more of this you can maybe

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,120
think maybe kdp

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,880
is something that is within kde but it

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
could make out into the false world

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
kirigami is already

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,840
being used by people outside of kiri to

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,840
develop some apps

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,280
the potential there is a much bigger

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,640
definitely and it can grow into the

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,320
false ecosystem

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,919
feel free to choose your own app and do

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
this exercise i'm just sharing some

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,559
examples here

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,840
so when we are talking about breaking

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,440
out of our bubble

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
uh let's think of some ways that we can

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,960
help

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,240
push our products into this um

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,400
so one of the like i've shared here some

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,480
key aspects of that could help your

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,919
product grow outside of this

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,919
bubble and scale into the world

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,919
uh one thing i came up with is like you

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,880
can start offering a unique solution to

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,880
an ex

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
to an existing problem so if you're

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,440
breaking through these bubbles it means

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
like

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,640
there are problems that your application

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,640
is solving or

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,240
you are responding to a growing demand

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,360
in this very specific niche

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,640
so your application is now delivering a

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
very good product

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
that people are using and they're

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
interested in using

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,840
not just because they're enthusiasts

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,520
about kde or about open source but

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
because they're enthusiasts about your

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,000
specific application

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,360
it probably means you're delivering high

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,960
quality software

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,799
that corresponds to the modern

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,520
environment of users so if you are

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,039
breaking out

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,720
if you want to break out from false into

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,559
the world maybe you need to start

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,279
thinking about what others are doing out

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,360
there

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,720
see how they design their products how

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,559
they deliver their products

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
and see how you can match that and maybe

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,320
even grow further than that

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,159
it usually means that you have already

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,760
figured out your user interface you've

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
made it into a friendly one into

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,919
something that

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
is more modern and people are you tend

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,600
to expect

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,559
where and what to find there it also

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
means that you are

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,720
already busy building an awesome user

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,240
experience for your users

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,720
so you have a community growing around

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
you

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,120
you are building a community of users

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,880
you are building a community of

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,720
developers maybe around you and you are

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,559
offering them a great

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,919
user experience from the time they join

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,279
you as users

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,520
and then getting involved in your

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,720
communities getting support and things

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,480
like that these are things that are

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,760
required to break into

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,120
uh other more bigger bubbles

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,360
of course you will need to raise

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,640
awareness around what you're developing

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
so you can further support it

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,760
and get people to learn about it get

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,320
people to

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,760
uh adopt it this is something i think

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,320
paul also mentioned

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,679
in the talk about how promo can be used

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,159
as a service in kde

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,000
so getting people to know about what you

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,480
do is the first step for them adopting

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,760
it and then growing out of battles

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,240
bubbles and of course

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,000
uh creating a partnership network as you

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,919
progress through this ecosystem through

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
this ecosystem and through these bubbles

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,200
it's very very important it will help

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,679
you to be introduced to the market it to

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,440
help you gain extra support and validity

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
of what you do as you find the right

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,520
partners

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,000
to push into these bubbles so

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,200
going back into the framework i talked

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
about earlier

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,320
let's try and see how we can maybe match

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
what i

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,440
mentioned now as what we might be doing

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,400
right with

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,880
each of these let's say sections of the

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,679
complete product experience

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
so if we are talking about policies um

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,120
then we need to

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,080
what this involves is usually is things

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,880
like licenses

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,520
is your community using some specific

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,640
license

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,559
is your product part of a community that

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,240
has a specific code of contact

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,679
what are you doing with decision making

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,440
as i mentioned earlier

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,440
and what are the development processes

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,000
set in place so all these are policies

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,919
that

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
in order to break out into these bubbles

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,240
you should probably have

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,360
in place as you go forward and as you

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,039
grow

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,640
or if you are interested in going

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,679
forward in going forward and growing

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,679
another thing about

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,520
support you need to be offering as i

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,080
mentioned great user support

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
this can be done with community building

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,000
through your

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,919
community of users this can be done with

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,200
uh onboarding you need to offer a great

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,720
experience people

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,320
when they're joining your product so

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
they can be attracted to it

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,640
and you can lure them in turn them into

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,039
contributors and

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,480
can turn them into regular let's say

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,679
developers or other types of

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
contributions

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,679
but charging is also something bad

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
support you get people to test your

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,200
products and

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,919
support them in figuring out the issues

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,399
all these are

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,000
things that need to be put in place for

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,880
your product to grow

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,080
third-party integrations uh in our case

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
maybe in kde case

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
in this case we need to think about

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,960
integrating with

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,960
desktop environments so if you are

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,679
developing an application that you want

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,279
users outside of maybe plasma or plasma

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,200
mobile to be using

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,480
so you need to start thinking how these

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
applications play

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,159
a place and if it plays well with other

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,919
desktop environments

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,200
or other types of environments maybe on

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,600
mobile so you need to figure out these

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
integrations for your app this also

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,120
means that you need to figure out

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,240
integrations for other operating systems

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,480
if you want your

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,000
application to ship into things like the

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,120
windows store or the apple store or

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,520
android and things like that then

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,440
you do need to start thinking on how you

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,720
can prepare your application in order to

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
reach that audience

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,640
and even more if your application is

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,200
shipping or maybe it's not application

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,960
but

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,960
your product is shipping on specific

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,600
hardware you need to make that

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,399
your software work very well with that

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
hardware

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,640
so you can reach that market so you have

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,720
happy users so you can find partners

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,480
if you are not yourself and doing

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,760
hardware stuff

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,159
uh talking about supporting systems

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,679
uh here we're talking about having

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,399
release management

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,559
processes in place taking advantage of

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,440
system administration resources so you

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,919
have

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,440
people managing that you have your code

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,440
repositories you have

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,799
you can collaborate on code in the in

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
the public you

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,240
you do your packaging for all the stores

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,000
we mentioned earlier or

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
all these supporting systems actually

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,159
things are usually happening behind the

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,080
scenes

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,520
that support you to deliver your product

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,679
into users and

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,360
users are not usually aware of them but

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,360
they are there and they are offering a

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,960
great experience to them

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,200
and to you for delivering your product

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
of course technology is key in what we

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,360
do

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,799
uh for your product to grow it needs to

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,919
be building in

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,240
new features you need to be uh to be

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,399
introducing new stuff so it can keep

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,840
momentum going to users

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:33,760
get them um building you know

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,080
uh exp get them to expect new stuff

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,000
wait for your new release see what's new

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,600
uh get the word out about it

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,360
you need to be delivering high quality

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,720
software as we mentioned earlier

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,440
so people can appreciate the stability

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
of your

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720
uh of the your application of the search

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,039
your television

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,480
you need to be innovative try to figure

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,200
out things that

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,159
uh others uh others from the competition

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,080
are not doing

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,159
trying to see how you can differentiate

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,480
your product what are the special

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,159
uniques and selling points of your

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,720
product that you can get

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,600
out to users to differentiate from them

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,919
and of course

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,720
the whole user interface and experience

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,520
we talked about

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,520
earlier all fall until this technology

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,960
section getting into sales

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,120
in maybe most of our cases in the open

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,720
source world we are good

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,240
when we talk about sales we are talking

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,120
about adoption so

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,000
because we do offer much of our software

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,080
for free

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,679
so when we are talking about sales we

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,679
are talking about adoption

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,279
how many users are using our software

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,640
what kind of users are using

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,919
our software and all that um

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,320
of course as things grow and as our

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,320
product grow we get donations so

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,919
that's part of sales you need if you're

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,399
doing great products people come to you

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,600
and they want to training to you so

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,000
that's part of the sales path and

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,640
app stores that in kde we increasingly

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,120
want to get

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,720
more products into more app stores and

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,600
then into more users

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,440
so they can also generate revenue and

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,919
also hardware partnerships can be

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,640
generated

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,519
in you so as you see as open source

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,200
products grow

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,640
you need to start thinking about these

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,080
kind of things that maybe weren't

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
thinking when your product

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,519
was part of a smaller team or a smaller

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,919
community

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,880
this will also allow your team and your

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,440
project to

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,120
grow and finally when we talk about

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,600
marketing is of course about

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,880
promoting your product raising awareness

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,480
around it so

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,799
people in order to adopt your product

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,240
they first need to learn about it they

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,919
first need to learn about these

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,640
advantages how it compares to other

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,760
stuff

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,519
so marketing will help you

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,760
create more content about your product

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,840
that it will inform users

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,679
it will get the momentum going on social

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,960
media or get people talking about your

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
product

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,200
discussing about your product and this

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,600
will definitely if you manage it well

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,279
and you manage to harness that potential

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,080
then it will definitely help your

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,440
product

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,440
based out of these bubbles

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,279
so having talks about these bubbles and

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,360
what you should expect and the

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,240
characteristics maybe of each of them

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,080

our

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,919
languages also very very important in

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,799
order to grow out of your language

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,120
bubble maybe

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,279
and if they're language barriers and we

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,000
have various platform-specific groups

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,919

flat packs snaps all kinds of things so

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,639
do some research around reach out to

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,919
these communities i think there's lots

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,159
of value there that

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,760
most kde projects are not harvesting at

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,560
this point and we should be doing more

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,760
we also have things like uh the kde and

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,240
the kili board

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,839
uh there people can help you with maybe

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,760
the logistics maybe with

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,960
some fundraising stuff we have the

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,440
working groups

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,560
um feel free to reach out for

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,599
recommendations

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,760
or maybe more administrative tasks and

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
of course don't forget

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,480
about all the enthusiasts and the early

00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,960
adopters you have around your project

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,560
they are a specialized team of their own

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,920
they can help you get the word out they

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,079
can help you maybe

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,760
in all the things i mentioned above

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,440
based on their skills so make sure

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,119
you're

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,839
reaching out to them and you're making

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,839
the most of them

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,400
so these are all the things i could

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,280
think of but it's very very important

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,720
here to

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,880
stress that your bubbles might vary uh

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,800
they might vary on a personal level they

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,760
might vary on a professional level they

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,000
might vary

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,800
on the bubbles that you want to reach

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,079
into

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,119
so um don't take what i said

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,200
as something that is like definite

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,680
feel free to start thinking about what

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,040
the bubbles you are facing or you are

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,320
experiencing are and how you can

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,680
grow it out of them um in addition to

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,079
that

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,160
bubbles as i think about them at least

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,599
can take various forms and meanings

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,240
so just by spending some time on it i i

00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,839
found these

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,800
four or five different ways of thinking

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,119
about bubbles they might leave like a

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,320
cozy familiar place we feel safe and

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,680
comfortable in

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,040
so we can stay there and focus and be

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,160
productive on the product we're

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,720
developing

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,040
by doing things we enjoy and know well

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,960
and we don't need to worry about growing

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,119
complexities and things like that so

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,359
maybe that's i think we enjoy

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,440
but at the same time it might be keeping

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,119
our product back so maybe we start need

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,040
to start thinking about other things

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,200
if we are at least interested in growing

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,440
out of this bubble

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,200
a bubble can also be a control situation

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
maybe like think of it as like a

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,599
hardboard that

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,680
allows to experiment learn

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,200
take the time to prepare our path for

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,359
growth so maybe

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,040
you have entered the kitty community you

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,280
have been here in a while

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,040
maybe now you have a safe place around

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,640
you your community supports you and you

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,720
have now some time to

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,760
start thinking and set up the processes

00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
of growing so

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,520
if you reach all these communities the

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,079
other teams as i mentioned earlier you

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,839
cannot start growing even more

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,800
um another way to think of a bubble is

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,200
like a platform

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,880
that enables you to validate your

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,920
products so when you join a community

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,400
when you join

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,359
an ecosystem and you offer your product

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,359
you can check

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,480
if there's demand for it as you go into

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,320
the logic bubble

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,760
maybe you find some limitations of what

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,200
you're doing and you need to adjust or

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,079
adopt accordingly

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,160
so you you get to test and validate your

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,359
product and try again so you can make

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,040
the next step so

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,320
this is something a bubble can offer to

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,480
you or a bubble can also be a milestone

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,480
that you have set up it's a goal that

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,200
you have set up and you want to achieve

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,000
and you can use it to need to reach your

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,520
next target

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,359
you maybe you want to grow out of three

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,640
bubbles that can make that job

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,560
so you need to go through all the

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,599
bubbles so every bubble is a major

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
milestone for you

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,200
that will help you to reach your goals

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,960
and finally

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,640
bubbles can also be maybe a small

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,079
prisoner if i can call it either a small

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,800
body or a helton

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,560
that you will have to try and overcome

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,760
if you are interested to continue

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,599
growing your products

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,800
to continue growing the team around it

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,000
and investing into new bubbles

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,560
so to conclude uh oh i see

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,359
we got the circle there as an icon

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,160
change but anyway um

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,800
i would like to get you to think about

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,880
uh

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,400
as a map what are your bubbles what are

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
you the bubbles that you're

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,480
growing your product in what are the

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,240
bubbles for you as a person

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,079
uh what are the bubbles of the team or

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,240
the project you are involved in

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,480
um are you thinking about breaking out

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,920
of them and if yes do you have a plan

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,760
if not why not uh have you considered

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,320
that or it is something that you just

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,320
never thought about and maybe what's the

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,040
next bubble you want to reach do you

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,359
have this

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,040
in your mind are you working toward that

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,839
what are you doing kindly

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,200
in order to best out of your bubble and

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,839
grow

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,440
that's it for me um happy to see we

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,800

feel free to reach out to me uh to me to

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,520

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,079
more things about products and growing

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,359
them

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,480
and maybe if i can offer some advice or

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,440
discussion i'll be very very happy to i

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,520
adam

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
hi thank you very much for the attack uh

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,480
no questions so far from the

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,160
audience here but i i do have one maybe

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,280
maybe a strange one is academy

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,760
in a bubble oh

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,680
i've never thought of it but it seems

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,880
like you thought about it so

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,480
what are your thoughts about that well

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,520
academy is kind of meant to

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,000
be the bible right it's a flagship kd

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,160
event

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,680
from time to time we do host people from

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,320
outside the community

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,079
but it's mostly for our community but

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,400
maybe

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,320
last is an opportunity for kd people to

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
expose themselves to the whole fossil

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,960
system which is what

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,520
i was talking about earlier so the next

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,760
bubble

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,560
so maybe that is an opportunity to grow

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,599
them further

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,839
so it's great that we have also asked

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,000
for people interested to show of course

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,160
it's focused on the apps ecosystem but

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,760
still we have many apps if you are

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,160
working on that

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
yeah last is a good opportunity and

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,079
academy of course but i think yeah

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,520
that's a bubble that we more or less

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,800
want to keep

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,960
and it's more conscious uh as a decision

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,640
to give it like that

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,839
yeah i i agree uh and i think that the

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,040
audience here also is agreeing and and

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,599
lots of uploads for your talk thank you

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,599
very much

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:48,319
thank you i'm happy and i hope people

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,319
