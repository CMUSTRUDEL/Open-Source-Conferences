Over the last decade, Qt Quick has become one of the best technologies for developing hardware-accelerated 2D "fluid" user interfaces, and is on track to eventually replace conventional desktop-style widget-based GUIs in many applications. In Qt 6 another possibility is approaching adolescence: you can use the same declarative QML language to create 3D applications too. In this talk we'll explore some of the possibilities: 2D applications for working with 3D content (like CAD, 3D design and 3D printing applications), 3D applications which also contain 2D user interfaces mapped onto the surfaces of the objects (games and simulations), and fully immersive 3D user interfaces. We hope that with all this power available via such an easy language as QML, the community can begin to develop entirely new categories of applications.
