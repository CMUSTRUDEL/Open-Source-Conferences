SPDX is standard to add license information to source code files in a machine readable way. This is important because:
* it allows automatic checking
* it enables super cool new features that were not possible before
* it prevents ourselves from accidentally providing software that has an unusable/conflicting license
In KDE Frameworks all non-deprecated parts already contain these markers, Plasma also did major work in this direction and similar efforts happened at further places in KDE. This talk will highlight what was achieved, where we are and it gives some ideas what people now can do with having license markers available.
