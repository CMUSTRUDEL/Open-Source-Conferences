Title: Akademy 2021 -  The History of Software Distribution - A Personal Journey
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen
Getting software to end users has always been an issue those who create the software have been worried about. A great many solutions have been proposed and attempted for this problem, and in this talk you will see an overview of the history of these attempts, and a discussion of some of the advantages and flaws each of them presents.
Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to three attempts at getting software to users, in the form of Flatpak, Snapcraft and AppImage. These, however, have not been the only attempts at making it easier for both software developers, and your humble speaker has been involved in one way or another with a number of attempts for several years now, both as a volunteer contributor and as part of employment.
In this talk we will explore the many ways this has been done, both high profile and more quiet attempts, some very interesting approaches, and some which have turned out to be less than successful. We will see what we can learn from those attempts, and we will see where we go from here.

[Music]

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,360
brilliant

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,560
right um yeah

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,720
so welcome to my presentation

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,480
um first a little short introduction

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,519
um i'm dan lanier to throw jensen

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,559
and i have been a member

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,440
of the kd community for a number of

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,880
years

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,280
at this point um

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
and i have had many guises over the

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,000
years but usually

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,920
looking either like that or like that

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,239
um but also as

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,600
um as a way of

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,680
introducing myself in a more

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,479
relevant fashion to what's going on here

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,680
um a short introduction to my digital

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,880
life

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,640
don't worry i'm not going to go through

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
all of this that's not really the point

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,280
here

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,320
um but it ties into

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,840
the title of this talk

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,040
um so back when i was eight

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,280
i got a commodore c64 and

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
had my first play around with basic and

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
then you'll notice there is some time

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
until

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,439
anything else happens because my first

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
sort of experience with that was that i

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,400
played with it for a while

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,600
and then the power supply broke

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,640
in that uh in that

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,680
or rather the a fuse blue and i didn't

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
tell anyone

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,759
for about a year uh so i didn't play

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,280
with it

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,960
and apparently i decided that

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,159
that wasn't important so no one knew

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,159
um but it did then

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
after a while turned into the case where

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
we you know ended up buying a computer

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,319
for the family um

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,440
which uh a 386

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,440
sx 25 with an an astonishing

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,120
512 k of ram that was

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:28,000
quite a thing came on you know a slot in

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,599
card um it came with windows 3.1

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,640
with the hotdog theme uh enabled

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,519
by default which was a whole entire

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,200
thing

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,239
and then i got into

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,080
batch scripting back then

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,599
which was fun um but then

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,120
time moved on i got a pc um and i

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,200
got uh a visual basic

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,319
um and played around with that for a

00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,920
bunch it's actually

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,599
started slightly earlier than what it

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
says there uh with

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,000
vb3 um

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,120
and then via vb4

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,959
and all the way to vb5

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
and then one thing that it doesn't

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,000
mention there

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,640
part of the reason why i upgraded to

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,760
vb5 and started actually being able to

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,879
release stuff in 96

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
um was that christmas of 95 our house

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,720
burnt down

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,599
and uh yeah that was a whole thing on

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,959
its own

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,480
but one result of that was that all of

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,920
us kids

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,040
got some money to spend on things

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,799
that had you know but

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,159
in the house so i spent a fair chunk of

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,080
that money

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,680
uh to buy bits for a new computer

00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,480
um and then everything

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
kind of you know took the standard turn

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,519
from there i guess

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,799
i went to s where i went to high school

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
and ran into some people who

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,599
played around with this crazy thing that

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,880
was called linux that i'd not really

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,239
done much in much with before then

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,080
um and i installed red hat 4.2

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,000
and then um started playing around with

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,040
that a bunch and

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,680
um you know the

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
the cute little startup sound uh the

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
test

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,120
sound that was uh leonis torval's

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,639
pronouncing linux as linux and all that

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,199
um but that was not

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,919
a part of my software distribution work

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,280
that

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,639
as it says there started really

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,479
in 96 where i released randomizer 3

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,880
which was a

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,320
wallpaper randomization tool so that was

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,840
my first

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,039
public release um it was at a computer

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,759
club so it was the first

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,759
public but you know distributed on a

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,840
floppy disk between friends

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,520
sort of thing um but that was my first

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,039
public release of a piece of software

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,400
that i had written

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,520
um but then through the uh

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,880
linux uh playing around

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,400
i eventually you know started

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,880
working on what eventually would become

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,199
a uh content management system that

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,800
actually happened a lot later

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,960
when it became travel sized it was

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
called other things over the years and

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,320
had different concepts over the

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,479
over time but also that was a as

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,120
a content management system for websites

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,400
that i also ended up releasing

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,520
eventually um which

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,759
uh yes as it says on the next bit

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,800
um the first sort of version of that

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,199
was called site ripple it was basically

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,319
a uh a pre-processing tool

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,960
that took bits of html with some

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,639
keywords in it and turned it into html

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,199
pages that were static and

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
it you know it kind of worked it was

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
very

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
very early sort of just string

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,600
replacement stuff but

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,160
it worked pretty decently and i did my

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,199
first couple of websites with that and

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
um eventually also released that on that

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
website and

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,759
i glained like lanier.dk kind of still

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,080
exists

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,880
incidentally travel size does not

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,400
because it was php3 so if you go to my

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,039
personal website

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,160
that has not been updated since then and

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,440
travel sized

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,880
no longer works because

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,880
you know php3 and security

00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,000
was from so that's been

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,319
not that been disabled since then but uh

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,599
it was part of my first sort of software

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,759
release journey um

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,360
and a couple of other things also got

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,160
released during that time there was a

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,720
a another couple of little tools written

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,599
in

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,919
uh visual basic and eventually

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,840
um when i joined

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,560
higher education after a small trip

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,000
through

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:39,199
through security job work which

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,599
uh security uh security guard work which

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,039
that was a strange experience talk to me

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,800
later if you want to hear anything about

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
that um

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
but because it's not really relevant to

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,560
software distribution here

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,960
um but then in 2006

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,759
i uh started

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,720
my direct interaction and my direct

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
involvement with

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,360
the kd community by making

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,479
the standard again uh

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,599
error of reporting

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
eight bugs in a single bug report and

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,919
getting told

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,000
that that is not how one reports bugs

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,840
because you know you're gonna start

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,120
somewhere and i haven't noticed so i've

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,639
wrote a bunch of them down

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,039
and you know standard sort of

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:34,800
thing and then yeah i got better

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,800
um but

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:43,039
so apart from that

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,720
a the my sort of

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,680
uh direct involvement

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,040
with actually trying to work out a

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,600
better way of getting software to people

00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,880
that wasn't just um

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,440
sticking it on your personal website and

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,560
hoping that people would notice

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,560
um the first sort of thing where

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,920
i started getting involved with that um

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,040
was the gluon project

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,240
at the gran canario desktop summit in

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,720
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,279
we had dr idk who presented us

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
uh and a bunch of others uh with a

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,600
couple of

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,440
uh nifty little tools and libraries um

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
which were based around the idea that

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
you should be you know

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,480
easily able to uh build

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,680
games uh primarily for the kde desktop

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,959
and so we uh that is iron

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,399
and i and a couple of others noticed

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,320
that this was a thing that could be

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,200
with a bit of um

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,000
finagling be turned into something that

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,360
could be

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
more than just

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
building some very simple games and then

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
hoping

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,519
again that someone else would distribute

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,600
them

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,600
um basically

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
what came out of that was the gaming

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
freedom project

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,600
which um was a kind of hybrid

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
thing where basically we looked at the

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,920
current

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,279
landscape of game distribution

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,800
and it was not

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,360
great uh weirdly

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,640
what we saw then is basically what has

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,920
happened

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,519
where uh all of these things are

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,600
kind of a closed

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
not

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:07,920
that available at the moment um about

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:13,040
uh digital archiving efforts for games

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:16,160
that the digital distribution

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,200
revolution uh comes up a lot

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,839
in that um and our our sort of

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
intentions

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
were that uh we should be able to do

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
better than

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,760
what well at the time the likes of steam

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
were doing which were locking people

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,320
into

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,000
effectively an ecosystem that they

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,680
couldn't really get out of easily

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
there is a bit more to that story

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,880
obviously it's not

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,839
just steam is not just valve and so on

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,200
but

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,120
yeah that was that was a part of our

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,160
intentions back then

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,600
um but also um

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,839
the distribution part of it was

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,880
based on uh this idea that

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,320
um you have

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,360
two things when it comes to

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:15,920
uh the making and playing of games

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,160
um which was then the topic of my

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,760
first talk at an academy in 2010

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,600
um which was the social game

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,519
distribution talk

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,440
which basically discussed how players of

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,200
games and makers of games

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,480
are not two separate entities there is

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
obviously the ones who make games who

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
don't

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,440
play them which

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,360
some who know me closer will

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,399
be aware that i'm actually in that part

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,519
yeah i don't really play games but

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,240
i do tend to

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
be a part of the playing of games i

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
don't

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,680
just don't tend to actively do it myself

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,160
but never mind um the idea being

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,839
that most people who make games also

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,880
play them

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,880
so there's a large overlap there and so

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
there was this idea that we should be

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,240
able to

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,480
support this enthusiastically

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,720
um and so we came up with the idea of

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,320
social distribution

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,040
where the idea was that you would

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,680
someone would have an idea and then

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,240
there would be tooling to support

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,639
that idea being created which at the

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
time was glue on creator which was a

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
tool

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
uh built on top of the engine system

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,440
that we built

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,920
and then we would have a way of

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:53,199
putting that stuff uh the resulting

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,440
um uh

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,600
the resulting game somewhere which was

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,639
the social desktop which

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,880
is basically what became opendesktop.org

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
and then there would as a kind of

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,839
connection point

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,959
and then there would be a way for people

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,000
to download and play that stuff

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,800
on on whatever platform they happen to

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,680
do

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,199
a lot of interesting icons in that one

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,240
because of course back then

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,600
migo and os2 warp

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:30,079
technically still existed so that was it

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
that was a weird point in history

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,399
and then the idea was that eventually it

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,839
would be a

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,240
two-way thing the uh

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,040
idea being of course that you should be

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,880
able to give feedback directly

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,160
and that it would be a bi-directional

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,959
um social uh

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,600
support system for both makers and

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,519
players of games

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,120
which again with things like steam and

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,399
so on has

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,160
kind of turned into a thing it's a lot

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,760
more tightly controlled on there but

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
that is effectively

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,199
the kind of thing that we were thinking

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,399
of at the time

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,839
and so in 2011

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:23,839
after i finished uni i got um

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,839
hired to um

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,519
work on a project which has

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,240
a similar kind of thing going on

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:40,000
um but was focused more directly

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,600
um on general software

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,360
distribution and so the idea uh was

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
obviously the problem with gluon it

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
wasn't great for things that weren't

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,480
directly based on gluon engine

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
technically you could distribute

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
stuff through it that weren't glue on

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,959
engine but it wasn't really great for it

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,079
um and so the idea was that

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,160
uh we had a lot of things that existed

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,720
which was also basically what the gaming

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,519
freedom

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,639
project noticed so we had a way we had

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,920
ways of getting things which was

00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,040
opendesktop.org or the kd store as it's

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,320
called now

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,560
uh we have ways of making those things

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
we had cute creator we have a bunch of

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,560
other ids but

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,720
creator was the sort of yeah it was

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,839
about acute so why not

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,480
and we had a way of

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,160
constructing binaries for a whole bunch

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,639
of different systems

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,199
uh which was the open build system the

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
or

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
the one originally uh built by opensuse

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
for

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,360
making their uh distributions but then

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
turned into something much much much

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,120
bigger

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,639
um and so the idea there was that we

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,759
would basically

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,959
connect the dots between those

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,079
which then resulted in the project

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,920
britain

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:03,759
um kind of plug-in

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,319
for qt creator and part of the reason i

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,439
say

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,559
kind of plug-in is that

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,880
it is technically a plug-in

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,640
but because of how q creator worked in

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,439
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
you couldn't build plug-ins for q

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,640
creator

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,120
without building q creator so it was

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,679
effectively a fork of q tracer

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,320
which not great but as a proof of

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,240
concept

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,280
it worked and it really did um you could

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,039
build a project in crete creator

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,919
and then you'd load up this thing you

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,919
would connect it to

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,720
opendesktop.org and you'd connect it to

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,520
open

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
the open build system services and then

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,799
it would

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,760
you'd fill out a little form with some

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,039
information which is the one there's a

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,080
a a picture of just there

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,520
uh you'd fill out that form with

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,559
you know the basic information of

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,640
versions and descriptions and so on

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:12,000
um and then it would create a

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
rough set of packages for you

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
you could then you know edit those and

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,799
you know

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,840
make them better but as a basic thing

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,679
you would have packages it would

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,360
build rpms and debs for the various

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,400
things that it supported on

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,720
obs at the time uh there was the very

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,200
early days of the windows build stuff on

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,440
there

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,679
and mac os wasn't supported at all um

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,720
and so we didn't really focus on that we

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
only had you know

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,600
half a year to build this thing so

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,559
it got put together and it worked

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
so the idea was you would do that and

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,240
then

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,720
once obs was done it's you you would

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,039
then

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,039
be able to check it wasn't polling you'd

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,320
have to ask

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,200
but you'd also as a as a person building

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
on there you could

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
subscribe to emails and it would send

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,440
you an email when it eventually got done

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,880
building your packages

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,520
and then through that same plugin

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,919
you would click make me a listing on

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,760
opendesktop.org

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,360
and it would do that for you it would

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,559
also then cache

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,960
the cache the knowledge

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,480
uh so that it you know you wouldn't just

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
be creating a bunch of new

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,720
listings every time it would update an

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,840
existing one and so on

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
um and so that was the

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,760
directional thing it didn't have the

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
commenting stuff it didn't have

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
that you know the social distribution

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,720
stuff that

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,799
gaming freedom kind of focus

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,840
was but it was a way of

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:58,640
going from ide to

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:01,760
uh to uh consumer of applications

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,840
in 2011 which is something that we

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,840
you know we basically have most of this

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,200
now um

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,720
but yeah we'll get back to that

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,120
um so uh

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,480
a decade after that happened right we've

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,480
got linux distributions

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,320
which are doing great they are doing

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
excellent work

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,559
um they've got some really polished

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,720
experiences

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,880
but of course there is only so much they

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
can do we're going to end up with

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
outdated apps uh the common one that

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,159
comes up

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,039
uh i didn't list it before but i was

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,320
also involved

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,480
in the uh creator project a fair bit so

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,520
i've been involved with getting creator

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,720
to the masses

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,880
through steam and so on um

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
over the years and one of the things

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,919
that comes up for

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,480
krita on linux is that it is always

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,200
outdated because creatures development

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,240
cycles are fairly fast

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,840
um so it's always outdated and people

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
will come to create their creator devs

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
and

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
go oh i've got a bug and that's great

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,600
and it's already fixed

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,039
it was done three months ago you haven't

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,440
got an update because

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,440
your distribution hasn't packaged the

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,320
most recent release

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,280
um and that's fine like it is the

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,280
distributions

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,400
work at a different pace to everything

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,480
else and

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,760
so that's fine hence the asterisk

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,159
um it's just a a reality

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,480
of what happens with it and that's fine

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
um

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,080
so we also have windows android and mac

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,600
os and

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,679
on there again we're kind of okay

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,080
we've got in particular in kde

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
we have the binary factory which spits

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,320
out

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,919
packages for those three now

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,480
with some caveats but it is

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,120
mostly there the bit where it says

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,120
everybody's rolling their own which is

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,679
less true for kde but

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,440
we do still have that situation kind of

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,360
happening

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,840
um we then have bundles which are

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
kind of the thing that happens on

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,280
windows android and mac os

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,400
where you create uh

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,440
bundles of the application versus the

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,880
developers of the

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,840
application create the builds and they

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,360
end up in the hands

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,760
of consumers uh directly

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
and that's pretty great uh you know

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
every you go around and you talk to

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
everybody and

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,480
pretty much everybody agrees that

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,679
bundles are pretty awesome

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,880
but also um yeah

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,240
there are a couple of versions of it

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,039
so we have flat pack and we have

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,200
snapcraft which are

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,600
i call i call them pseudo distributions

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,520
which i don't think is entirely unfair

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,120
um they have um

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,240
they have both a version of a

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,520
a runtime where they bundle

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,799
effectively a a set

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,919
of the libraries that make up

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,159
a sort of coherent

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:35,200
lump of supporting libraries

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:38,799
and then those get updated

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,240
more regularly you might end up with

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,159
uh you you might end up with

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,960
a couple of different versions of some

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,279
runtime because some package

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,360
demands a uh an older version

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,559
of the runtime and can't be updated to a

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,799
new one

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,880
but as a rule you don't have a lot of

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,840
duplication there

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,000
and then you have app images which are

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,799
i it's right there a more pure bundle

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,120
because it is based on the idea of

00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:18,320
effectively bundling everything

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:22,159
that is not in a

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,720
conceptual very minimal

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:29,840
uh desktop or uh desktop system

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:33,120
um then you know i

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,799
also mentioned the not quite app image

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,400
type things which are things like

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,880
discord and telegram

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,840
and there's a bunch of others as well

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,320
but

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,360
those which are the ones where the idea

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,559
is you go on to the developers website

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,679
you download it

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,400
oh incidentally we should totally play

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,159
that later

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,080
um super super tux cart

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
it's distributed roughly like that where

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,159
the idea is you download it from the

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,159
website

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,200
from their website you

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,720
decompress it somewhere and it then

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,000
just runs and

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:18,080
you yeah but it's the same

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,400
basic concept as an app image minus

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:26,080
the sort of uh

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,159
stuff that makes a thing an app image

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,120
there's a bunch of little

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,799
like tick boxes basically that you you

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,880
have to run through

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,039
to make your thing an app image

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,320
the closest of these to that would be

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,919
telegram which

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,279
has literally a binary

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,159
that you launch and there's nothing else

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,679
uh it's just the one binary uh discord

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,720
and supertux carlos

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,320
different they've got lumps of stuff

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,320
mixed in with them so

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
but conceptually they're very similar in

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
that you just

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,919
download a thing from the website

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
decompress it if for some reason they've

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,840
compressed it

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,840
and then run it and that's it um

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
some of them will have auto updates some

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
of them don't uh

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,799
flat pack and snapcraft have that built

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,799
into their

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:26,480
uh on on client service

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,600
and app images have

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,240
the ability to be auto updated but it is

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,360
not a guarantee

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,480
um and then

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,080
oh yeah and of course if you i think app

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,440
image came out of nowhere

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,440
uh just for that you can go back and

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,760
find out that it was

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,799
it was kind of born out of what was

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,679
originally called

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,360
click not to be confused with click

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,159
which became snapcraft

00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:01,760
which is spelled differently um

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,960
uh but yeah so

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,159
as i was saying we have it yeah it was a

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
little bit hyperbolic

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,159
the absolute state is basically we're

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,320
good

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,919
we we're well underway to making

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,200
something shiny here

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,640
um we have the open build system we have

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,480
kv's craft which

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:26,080
is a this gigantic meta build system

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,320
thing that you fire off a

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,880
effectively you fire of one command and

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,559
it will build and package

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:39,200
uh anything that kde has

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:44,320
that craft has a um

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,320
what's that called a recipe for um

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,600
and then we have katie's binary factory

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
which these days

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,840
is in part uh

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,799
based on craft and that's pretty neat

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,399
uh i like that kind of things fitting

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,960
together really nicely

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
um in particular when i say binary

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,000
factory what i mean is that it

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,960
is based on that for the windows builds

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,320
and for app images they are

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,120
built using using that i think also mac

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,480
os

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,640
not entirely sure forgot to look

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
the

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,320
snap and flat pack packages that the

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,279
binary factory produce are not

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,840
based on that but exactly how that's

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,440
done

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,559
also don't know um and then we have the

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,559
kde store

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,080
which is getting a lot of work done to

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,600
it at the moment

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,200
um and some of you will have noticed

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
it's a little bit slow but that is a

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,559
part of that work there

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,440
it's undergoing some massive

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,000
rewrites on the underlying system which

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,679
are having a bit of an effect

00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,880
um but it's there and it's

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,720
yeah it has all of the stuff that we

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,760
always had on the store amongst others

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,679
we have uh we have

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,600
uh binaries on there still um

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,520
and then we have discover our very own

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,960
uh app store uh or app store client so

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,240
to speak

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,360
uh which sort of is

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,880
a kind of aggregation point

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,799
for all of these things um

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:38,880
and perhaps the most important

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,840
of all of these is that the bus factors

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,279
for all of these is improving the open

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
build system was always pretty good

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,919
because it was a

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,760
a commercial effort effectively by uh

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,960
i open source the that it was available

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,080
to the outside world

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,399
is more of a almost a side effect um

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,080
but also craft used to be effectively a

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,120
a one person

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,840
thing it is now there's more people

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,520
on it now uh the

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,520
uh same thing with discover used to

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,559
basically be one person there's now

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,600
a small team there it's pretty cool

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,919
um and so yeah there's basically there

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,960
are

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,440
more people getting actively interested

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,799
in this

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,440
which is neat um

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:32,880
and so what i'm suggesting now

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,600
is that we might just be able to

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,279
actually pull this off

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,640
of course back then i called it social

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,120
game distribution these days it would be

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,840
a federated social software distribution

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,880
system

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,399
uh because of what the

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,520
bits are and we now have

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,360
a better language for it so my

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,039
suggestion is that we have

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,559
discover already we have the kde store

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,720
specifically we have the open

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,679
collaboration services which uh

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,799
what ties to the store and many other

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,880
places

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:15,039
uh yeah i know what i said there

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,760
and then there is this tiny little thing

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,880
called the xg bundle app installer

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,760
which is a little thing that i put

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,760
together

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:29,600
which has the idea that um

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,960
you can stick stuff on the kd store

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,000
in whatever bundle format it happens to

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,440
be

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,799
um and the xdg bundle app installer

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,840
can handle that for you it's just

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,240
a small tool so that you don't need to

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,399
really know what format your bundle is

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,279
it'll just kind of work um

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,120
that's the intention the reality is it's

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,320
early days

00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,440
but i thought i would mention it because

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,480
the promise is of all of this

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,640
that we will end up in the situation

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,279
that uh that the social

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
game distribution concept of gaming

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,440
freedom

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,799
originally intended uh which is

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,399
feels pretty neat um

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,120
so yeah

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,039
yeah that was yeah that was basically

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,880
what i should have said there so

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:34,000
in 2021 i'm hoping that we will have

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:38,240
that um and that it would

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,760
basically look a bit like this

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,720
um if you recall the old

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,679
from the old graphic from 2011 this is

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,799
basically that

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,159
but with modern bits uh

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,760
so q creator is okay develop

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,039
because uh yeah

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,519
it doesn't make sense any uh to put it

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,640
basically anywhere else uh nk develop

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,960
has a really solid

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,559
uh plug-in infrastructure and we don't

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,840
necessarily need the plug-ins either

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,120
because we can kind of

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,240
just do the thing in k develop

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,120
but also yeah that would be neat

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,840
and then integrate that with open open

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,080
desktop

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:26,640
and incidentally through

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:30,159
this thing um if you install it

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,279
uh then discover already

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,039
does this uh

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,559
so yeah that would be my hope just

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,480
i thought i'd throw that one in at the

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,120
end um but

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,399
the basically the state that we are in

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,559
uh in software development feels

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,559
pretty solid which is a neat place to be

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,200
there is obviously always more work to

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,840
be done but

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,760
yeah i'm pretty solid i'm pretty happy

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,120
about all this

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:11,200
so uh yeah

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,240
any questions thank you very much dan

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,560
for this presentation um

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,839
we do have still sometimes and we do

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,240
have already some questions coming in

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,599
i'll i

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,000
didn't actually notice the time

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,520
that's pretty that's all right that'll

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,359
do

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,919
perfect um okay so pro bono asks

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,359
are you aware of any truly distributed

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,960
app stores

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:44,320
with any without any central servers

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,639
all done in peer-to-peer including a way

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,359
of

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,079
peer producing trust that something

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,839
you'd be

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,440
interested in i am not but that is a

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,919
really good idea

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,040
um if we can pull that off that would be

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,040
super neat

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,400
um possibly a little bit of a big

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,920
discussion for right now

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
also we probably need to actually be

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,119
talking about it uh

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,040
but also uh oh no

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,480

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,359
book

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,880
you should totally come and have a chat

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,680

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,599
definitely yeah that's uh

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,520
