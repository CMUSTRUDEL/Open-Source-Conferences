Getting software to end users has always been an issue those who create the software have been worried about. A great many solutions have been proposed and attempted for this problem, and in this talk you will see an overview of the history of these attempts, and a discussion of some of the advantages and flaws each of them presents.
Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to three attempts at getting software to users, in the form of Flatpak, Snapcraft and AppImage. These, however, have not been the only attempts at making it easier for both software developers, and your humble speaker has been involved in one way or another with a number of attempts for several years now, both as a volunteer contributor and as part of employment.
In this talk we will explore the many ways this has been done, both high profile and more quiet attempts, some very interesting approaches, and some which have turned out to be less than successful. We will see what we can learn from those attempts, and we will see where we go from here.
