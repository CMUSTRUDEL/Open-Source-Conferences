Things got a bit quiet and slow again regarding the community data analytics. The universe has a weird sense of humor, admittedly it went out of control this time. But behind the scene, things have still been happening in the community at large and with our community data analytics tooling in particular. This talk will explain what's new in that department and produce a new report on the community adventures. No line will be stolen from Lewis Carroll for this talk... until we decide otherwise.
In this talk we will pick up where we left in 2018. We focused quite a bit on the history of the tools we use for community data analytics. Because of this we showed only a few phenomena which could but didn't do a large study of the community.
Since then, more features have been added to our tooling which allow to leverage more data for GitLab based projects. Since KDE now switched to GitLab for a little while, it is time to take a closer look at the interactions happening there. This is especially interesting since even quite a bit of traffic from mailing lists moved on that platform.
We will revisit several older topics under that new light. In particular, we should have a much more precise reading of the contributor networks than ever before. Also, we will see how KDE did under the on-going pandemic.
