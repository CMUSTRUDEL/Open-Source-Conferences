actually

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,000
this is a video editing application so

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
it's we say they say we are leading an

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
open software so we are happy of that we

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
are happy to be

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,640

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
start the presentation with the video

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
that i created last year for

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,400

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,960
something before to run the video the

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,840
video actually is the story

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,439
the the history of acadian life starting

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,000
from to try

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,640
from 2002 that is the foundation of the

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
project

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
up to today and someone probably already

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,959

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,200
on the about of the site already watched

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
last year so i asked the person that

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
people that already watched it to be

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,239
patient

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,640
and just three minutes though and then

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,239
we started to talking about what's next

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,280

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,159
kenyan live and all the projects are

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,519

it's time for you to start so

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
you know what in kg live is we start

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:47,840
with

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:47,840
this video

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:56,400
[Music]

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,640
kdnlive is a community project which

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
aims to deliver a free and open video

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
editing software application

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,519
to allow everybody to produce quality

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,920
content in order to increase the

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,239
democratization of the media

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,200
the application is a graphic interface

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,159
written in c

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,720
plus with qt and kde libraries for the

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,680
mlt framework written by dandenity

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,239
which relies on ffmpeg to decode and

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
encode

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,280
almost all the video and audio formats

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
that are out today

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,720
and which hosts effects libraries like

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,919
freyor and moveit for video

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,600
and last spot and socks for audio by

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,800
following the official documents that we

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,639
can find on the internet

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,280
the project was launched by jason wood

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,560
who released version 0.2.3

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:45,680
in october 2003

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
soon katie and live 0.2.4 followed

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
but the community did not yet exist and

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,560
the group was very small

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,199
the project stopped for two years

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,840
before the end of 2005 jean-baptiste

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
mardel

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
who heard that the project would be

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,440
reactivated offered as help

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,160
and in 2006 he signed the post of the

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
new release

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,039
0.3 of the program from this moment on

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,800
he became the main reference point for

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,080
the project

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
version 0.4 and 0.5 are soon distributed

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
but there is an issue a refactoring of

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,400
the code is needed to go forward

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,320
the program has to be moved from kde 3

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,520
which is not compatible with mlt

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
to kde the rewriting ends in 2008

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
followed by several new releases but in

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
2011 a further migration from kde 4 to

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,930
kde 5 was needed

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,400
to allow the program to grow

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,800
[Music]

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
in 2012 a crowdfunding campaign is

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,039
launched to fund the operation

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
and before the end of 2014 the goal is

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,199
reached

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,240
then finally in 2015 kdnlive becomes an

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120
official kde

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,720
application john baptist was invited to

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,160
academy to present 10 years of activity

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
the new perspective is to make the

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
project even bigger

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,319
before the end of the year the first

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,400
canadian live cafe is announced with the

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
aim of getting more people involved

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,759
during this virtual meeting it

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
immediately became clear that in order

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,600
to grow

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,160
kitty and live needed to be

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,800
cross-platform the windows version was

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
announced and 2016 began with a sprint

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
meeting followed by the new logo and the

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
new site

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
but as soon as the development of new

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,960
features started it was evident that the

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
code for the timeline had to be

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,240
rewritten

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
because it was too old and no longer fit

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
everybody knew that the refactoring

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
could take several months or years

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,890
but the community did not lose

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,440
enthusiasm

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,479
[Music]

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
in 2018 a new roadmap was written and in

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
the refactored code was distributed

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,720
although some fine tuning was still

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,400
needed

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
to overcome this the focus of the

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
community in 2020

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,000
has revolved around fixing and improving

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
the program the result of this

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
is the latest version 20.08 which

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,919
delivers stability

00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:03,840
several new features and a new interface

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,840
with five workspaces

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,880
and that was the video

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,919
now i want to

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,000
share immediately this

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,199
window these windows actually is the

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
window

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
the kid in live that is also my

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
background

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
is the project is the project that to

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,360
produce

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,160
in the video you just watch i open it to

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,039
show you that

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:43,599
is not very difficult there is a lot of

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,840
situations a lot of clip and different

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,960
arrange all together to watch what we

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,840
see

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,400
these all these um audio tracks are

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
actually

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,840
because i did some tests with different

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,199
music but i don't enter in them

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,560
i start from the interface to show you

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
for example some improvements so we stop

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
with the

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,280
interfaces that i we speak about

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,000
this last year these different

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,840
layout that for example we now from

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,240
login

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,520
to effects to audio etc

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
but uh we didn't stop here we make some

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,280
small improvement

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,360
bigger improvement for example to the

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
interface about interface for example i

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
can

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,479
tell that we create these

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,560
zoombar that are all over the interface

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
not just in the timeline for example if

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,120
i

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,560
load this audio you can see that i can

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
navigate the audio in

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,200
very fine details so this is

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,200
improvement also this is connected sorry

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
so this is just when you are live it

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,240
always up

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,760
okay so it was me uh so

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,000
when you want to navigate more in the

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,440
detail also the step of the time and you

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,480
have the scroll bar

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,440
also here so we all the window now are

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
i have this commodity another stuff we

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
can

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
we can show about the improvement of the

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
ue for example we can

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,519
change the color of the clip for example

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
if i want to add light

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,560
this clip i want that is a different

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,040
color and background to

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,680
see to mark i can select the clip

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,360
and i can for example change the color

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,000
to red for example

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
if we want or another color to be

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
highlighted

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,560
in our workspace as we are here i can

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,080
show you that we can also have

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,920
the way to manage the tumbling uh that

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,079
we terminates in different ways so we

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,120
can normalize the audio to have

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,760
the maximum size of the audio or just

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,680
take the audio as the the volume

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,680
represented what you determine now

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
the volume will maximize because when

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
you have very tiny body we don't see

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
anything to maximize the volumes of

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,680
normalize the timer it could be

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,720
convenient etc another

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,360
thing i can show you that sums but we

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,800
have not

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,079
before was that now we can

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,959
remove simultaneously what all the

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,680
tracks we want

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,680
that is something some normal but

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
actually we miss it and now we have it

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,519
it's

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,959
very important before to close this

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,480
project because i don't want to change

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,120
anything here because it's a

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,959
complex project i would like to show you

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
that we have also the

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,839
another new feature important this one

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,920
is archival project archival project

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,040
mean that now we can

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,600
create a an archive a zip

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,079
archive or a target's ad archive with

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
all the asset or some of the outset we

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
want

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
that to our sharing proposal of course

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,640
or

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,760
to move for example when we have to move

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,959
to another machine

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,920
and to have not the address

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,320
to all the pro other situations so we

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
move

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
just the archive and this point we can

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,959
open back

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,959
in the machine so without any troubles

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
now i open a new project so i can show

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,120
you

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,360
for further thing that happened in

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,000
the company so i started going this

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,920
login space where in this moment we

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,680
already have the media browser that i

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,399
showed you better later because i will

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
import

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
more clip and the online resource that i

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,959
show you now for example we have

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,600
some uh all the resources like

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,639
excels internal child archive etc

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,200
they want to i need some trees

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
i can just run freezer we find that

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
there is

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a little trees with all the credits

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,200
about the person that

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,959
share with us so without we can download

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,680
the license etc

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,760
in the browser we have the the preview

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,040
of the clip i show you later we can just

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,720
drag and drop our clip from the

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,000
position they are to our beam and we can

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
find it in our bin

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
here too i chose this clip because

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,200
actually this clip

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,399
is an interview to this guy that i was a

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,320
project for a broadcaster

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,720
so i use it because i want to show you

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,720
that we

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
i want to show you that now we add the

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
two

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,959
features what i mean

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,240
um i mean that we have a

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,240
subtitle automatic subtitle so again so

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
title track that we can use to create

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
subtitles

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
we have here title creator etc but we

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
can also create subtitle

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,839
automatically so for example i

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,639
highlighted by putting

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,160
an in and out point on the timeline to

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
select a zone

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,920
i click on the wonder where all the way

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,720
to reach this point

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,360
we select which kind of parsing of the

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,959
text we want

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
the language we can download different

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,880
language from the bosque mosque is the

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,120
plugin we are using that is we have to

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,399
thank them to produce these these

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,800
open software so too and we process

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:46,160
our clip while we are processed

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,279
in i'll show you that we have another

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,079
tool this is text edit that actually

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,040
we can load inside the clip monitor a

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,279
clip

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,760
select the zoom we want and then extract

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,440
the text from the audio as same as the

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
we are doing with the subtitles what

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
happened when we have the list of the

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,279
audio we can

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,560
edit the text or export the text to a

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,839
textbook etc

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,720
we can anyway edit the text and then

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
export a playlist a timeline that

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,320
actually contain

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,320
the footage related the 2d edited text

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
so i show you the interface now in the

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,720
meantime as you can see

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,760
we are producing our subtitles that now

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
we show

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,040
how much are precise or not in terms of

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,000
timing

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,880
and transcription so as you can see now

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
we have our

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,639
subtitles here so we can open it

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,480
edited physically we have time etc and

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,240
i'll show you what happened here

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
my name is david danske and i'm a

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,480
professional cycling instructor

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,639
working in london as you can see

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,839
to become a cycling instructor in the uk

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,839
it is a national

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,839
accreditation so my job title is

00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
officially

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,839
okay so

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
it works pretty well in my opinion i

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
didn't know how it's parsing now the

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
text if i correctly

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,279
select the correct libraries actually

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,279
because before when you take the test

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,480
was pretty precise the text

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,680
we can do the same here

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,399
by using the models by parts in the zone

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,760
for example

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,839
the zone and then extracting here is the

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,959
button creating a timeline

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,600
and the end of the job you see the

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,440
playlist

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
that is contained just the little text

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,199
we can

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
i don't know if we have time to parse

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,920
again

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,680
the same text okay i do it

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,600
[Music]

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,279
here and we'll see that we have also

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,880
the space for the the empty

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,759
where there is no dialogue there is the

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,839
empty space so it's very useful

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
for youtubers when they want to remove

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
for example an empty space when they say

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,160
nothing to make it

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,800
automatically no speech you can see here

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,360
for example this is a

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
first line of text then you know that we

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
have a pose

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,920
here so probably will be again no speech

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,600
in the following

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,519
lines and so on if we edit this text

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,199
so we copy and paste and move it no

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
speech or remove the speech what we

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,480
remove and then we extract it

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
let's release we have the playlist

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,839
entered following

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,880
our criterias now

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,000
other stuff i want to show you that are

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,000
interesting for example very basic but

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,440
very interesting is that we finally

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,440
have a single track transition

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,680
here everybody write me so i'm scared

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,600
that something is not

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,920
working or i don't know i hope that

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,040
everything because i don't see what i'm

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,360
broadcasting so anyway

00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,360
here

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,600
i have to close this telegram

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,520
please could you make the audio from

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,839
your screen share it's making it

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,839
impossible to hear what you're saying

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,039
thanks

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,000
okay i have problem with the audio

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,360
still i have to recognize the audio even

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,840
if

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,840
tommy please

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,160
i need a feedback for the audio please

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,520
but the issue was that we can hear you

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,640
fine but the

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,000
sounds from your pc like notification

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
sounds and from

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,039
kdn live are a bit too loud so if you

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
can

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,200
lower or mute the every other volume

00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,559
other than your

00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:05,360
voice it would be perfect

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,360
and i you need to admit yourself again

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
sorry

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,280
you're still muted unfortunately

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,919
on big blue button if you can admit

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,200
yourself i cannot do it okay

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,280
okay i remove the application

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
i have the phone that is not here that

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,160
was ringing before iop is not bothering

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
me again

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,840
even if i will go to i hope that we

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,320
didn't break

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,919
any good moment for anybody with this

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,840
issue i go back i was

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,840
speaking about

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,400
this singular transition

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,880
we apply it i show you before we click

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
this

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
and the button but there is other way to

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,960
install it we

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,960
can trim it

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,080
move it and we have an interface to

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
change

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,400
parameters about effect

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,760
parameters we do

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,559
a good job a big job by rearranging all

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,840
the effect in

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,320
categories first

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,320
we had some effect i have a list i don't

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,600
remember now we have some

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,280
we have a video qualitator we put inside

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,880
we have all the

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,320
vr 360 effect for

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,919
uh virtual reality cameras

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,760
and padding and other interesting feel

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,840
the strawberry interesting feature that

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,440
comes recently

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,240
about the filters we make an improvement

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,440
also regarding the

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,480
keyframes management might give myself i

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,919
give me a second here okay different

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,440
management so we

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,400
can we now can use this button to create

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,240
automatic

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:39,039
keyframes by managing the footage

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,039
and we can for example um

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:47,280
select for example now i'm clicking

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,000
taking press shift key on the keyboard

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,159
and i click

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
and drag for example we can select more

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,400
keyframe this way

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,280
we can do it by clicking click click

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
even press

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,080
ctrl and click on the keyframes for

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,000
example just like multiple frames

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,760
we can even move multiple frames a time

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
we can duplicate more so for example if

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,440
i select

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:17,679
one and two sorry one

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,360
and two and then i scroll here

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,600
i can duplicate

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,440
the two keyframes i start for the second

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,559
one etc

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,600
but we can i can show you

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,080
move more keyframe i i

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,480
i show you before we can duplicate more

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,520
keyframe and we can even

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,520
select moki frame example

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,080
okay and then

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,280
change a parameter and apply this

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,360
new parameter to all

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,280
[Music]

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,120
the order selected keyframe we can

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,360
select which kind of parameter we

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:03,919
want to apply to all the other keyframes

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:07,520
another thing that we improve in term of

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,799
effect we create

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,840
a zone for effect that are applied

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,480
on the track single track on the master

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,919
for example

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,400
example if i

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:26,080
oh it's very visible if i play a sepia

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:28,240
sepia effect on the master

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,919
this is a master effect means that all

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,039
all the the output

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
is affected by

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,960
okay if we want just to apply this

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,679
effect on the part of the timeline

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,799
i click here and we can i can extend the

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,159
example the area i want to

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,520
just reflect so not

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,000
all the time this can be could can be

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,840
done

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,799
also or sorry

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,640
also on the track because i can apply

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:09,679
the filter on a single track

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,520
and you can see we can have we have the

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,440
area

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:20,400
also just for the hide

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,400
on oh sorry now is off the filter

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,240
as you can see we have also a single

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,240
area

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,360
in the track or on the master

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,840
now i would like to change again i know

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,000
before i

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
move the changer i do something i showed

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,080
that someone complained about

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
the title that is uh nobody is working

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,679
on it

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,559
is not true i show you some improvement

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,760
also

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:57,520
on the title so here we create a

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,840
title uh

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,039
now we have the background okay we have

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,559
new shapes for example

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:11,600
passing around the shape we have again

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:15,520
reintroduced i show you here if i can

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,440
go down the type writer effect

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,400
so if i

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,919
the typewriter effect so we now finally

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,760
can use it

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,000
again so we can show we can make appear

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,799
the text the character by character by

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
word by

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,760
line and we even can customize the kind

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,960
of animation

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,720
but the chance when we create a title

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,799
to duplicate it by opening

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,840
editing and we can update the old

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,880
title or create a new one it could be

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,960
the copy or

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,159
a dedicated copy so different from the

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,000
original one

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:00,880
and by using the patterns and

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,159
the template we can of course just store

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,840
for example preset

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,840
and different titles so the title starts

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,159
to be pretty complete at this point

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,279
there is also new stuff but i don't want

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,520
to say too much

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,880
in the title so i close now

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,120
um okay actually before to close i want

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,960
to open these are two beta version of

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,240
kdm live

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,919
the first one is that one

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,720
and we have to thank you you you use

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,640
code cell

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,840
for this uh uh

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
new feature the moment that we have to

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,559
wait that

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,559
it's opening so i can switch

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,880
sharing the new window is open without

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,880
one second please

okay it's finally on so i can share it

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,840
i changed

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,240
okay also here okay

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
and i can close this one sorry that i

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,400
have

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,200
space too many stuff okay this is

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
the space of the beta version arcadian

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,960
live

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,000
it looks like the same actually i can

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,159
use the

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,200
media browser as i told before for

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,039
example now i change

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:43,520
completed a folder i

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,520
year let me look kind of

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,720
footage as i told you we can

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,440
for example here we're gonna do

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
the preview

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,720
now we can for example

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,000
start from selecting one two

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,039
three four 5

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,440
6 and we can

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,440
drag

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,399
sorry okay the clip inside the project

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,399
straight away from

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,900
[Music]

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,360
now i'm here to show you for example we

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,399
have a long

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,080
clip here okay we can use this one

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,600
five seconds for example this one that

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,840
is longer we take a section

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,120
[Music]

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,240
here

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,080
we put it under it after it and then we

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,279
use another

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,840
some second of that one we create a

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,279
small

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,960
project now we are in this situation we

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,159
create these three

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
[Music]

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,080
objects but when we are working we are

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,279
not happy

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,399
about the in and out point

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,600
of this midsection for example because

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:21,760
it's not

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,760
okay very well for example there is

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,880
the zoom that's after the zoom we cut

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,880
immediately

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:34,000
so we want to trim it by using the sleep

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,320
system so i click on the sleep will be

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,520
available with the keyboard on a

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,880
certain point so now we can change

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,640
the in and the out point of the clip

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,640
without moving it

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,320
you can see if you watch in the timeline

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,720
that we have a blue area that shows us

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,440
the maximum range of the frames of the

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,559
clips

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,039
that is the blue paid blue area and the

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,080
dark

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,799
blue area is the part we are using this

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,679
moment

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,919
in the project monitor we will we can

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,840
watch the in-out point

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,279
you in our point of the clip following

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,320
what i'm doing

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:15,600
moving and the previous outpost

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,000
point and the following important clip

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:24,480
tried what to do for example i want to

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,480
start with the red bus

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:32,799
avoid the zoom

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,799
at the end designing my new in

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
our

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,120
while we are doing performing this um

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,559
operation we have all the referencing

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,080
time of key frames

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,080
numbers and these minus fives one plus

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,039
one plus five will be for the future

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,960
for future one will be buttons we can

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,720
click to add and remove

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,080
frame in in this quantity next step of

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:10,159
the demonstration and then i finish

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,159
is to run another

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:19,039
copy okay then live always better

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,360
running it okay now i

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:26,640
share it so i close this one

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,760
and in the meantime i can even really

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,760
terminate that one

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:40,080
so i share the new one

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,840
okay i can do the same

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,360
here too okay i already did

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,039
um now

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,520
i show you that we can this is a

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,159
feature that will be in the conversion

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,919
probably

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,840
so in this summer the streaming will be

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,360
complete probably at the end of the year

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,519
not in the next release we can add

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,840
the one playlist will mean more than one

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,640
sequence or more than one timeline

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,440
if i add the playlist and i click it

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,880
as you can see we have two tabs now

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,360
there are the two different

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,360
clips if i for example create

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,640
a color clip for example cyan

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:33,120
and another curry clip that could be

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:37,039
yellow for example and i use

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,159
one two

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:43,200
and three just to make an example

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,120
i take the playlist we create in the

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,799
other timeline and we have

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:54,320
exactly 15 seconds when five seconds

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,320
yellow five second of sign

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,120
and five second a yellow game

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:06,320
but if i

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:11,200
change this sequence of object

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,200
and i reverse it

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,679
what happened is there we are still a

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,799
dark

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,640
area beginning we remove it

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:26,840
we go here and the editing

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:30,399
is changed here now we have a

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,240
cyan yellow

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,440
and science so this shows that are going

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,760
in the direction

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:43,519
of creating the multiple

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,080
timeline i i hope that this

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,399
was visible i don't i don't see any more

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,799
they're sharing

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,440
you're in with the moment i have a

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,399
problem

00:32:51,440 --> 00:33:00,159
in in my

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,159
i don't know what's happening

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,760
so if someone can't give me a feedback

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,600
about if

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,320
you were able to see or not the

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,360
demonstration could be

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,279
nice like you did with the microphone

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:19,679
i'm very sorry for this for this

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:23,039
uh we could see the application so far

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,120
now i don't know why i

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,519
okay i try to share it again with the

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,519
moment

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,240
but anyway we we were you were able to

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,640
understand what no

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,840
no it's not more visible in the list of

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,840
the of the

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,440
no there's no more visible in the list

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,240
okay i run it again i

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,240
i start again

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,159
is the beta version this one and

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,440
could be problematic so i run again a

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,279
normal version of

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,279
kdenlive to have it as a background

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:11,520
the risky beta version but

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,520
i hope that you were able to

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,760
follow the demonstration anyway okay i'm

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,839
trying to

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,839
fix up everything here okay

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,359
oh wow

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,839
i voila

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,119
we are back so if there are questions

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
i'm very happy to

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,960
i hope that i didn't forget anything but

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
it's possible because the list of things

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,040
we did is so

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,119
we did so many stuff that i really i try

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,760
to be very synthetic in half an hour

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,960
i would like to answer with pleasure

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,960
with the question if there are

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,440
okay thank you very much massimo

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,240
so far there are no questions

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,000
in the widget although there is one

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,040
comment

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,240
which i guess i can read waiting for

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,240
questions to come

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,000
this is from a user that says i would

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,400
just like to thank everyone whose work

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
on

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,640
kd in life for their hard work the

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,680
potential of the project is limitless

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,960
thank thanks to all of your efforts and

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,240
i completely agree with that comment

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,800
okay i i think i i speak for

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,720
the group because i'm not alone we are a

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,680
community and we are a

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,000
strong group on the base so i can thank

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,320
for

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,839
everybody i hope that with the technical

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,760
issue we had

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,599
the explanation was clear and then

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,040
everything anyway we haven't you have an

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,760
idea of the new

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,599
stuff that are coming mostly the the new

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
training tools

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,599
and the multiple timeline and all the

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,200
job we did starting from the point we

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,680
dropped in the video before so means

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,720
that we have just a multiple workflow

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,400
for the workspace for different workflow

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,800
and now today we have a

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,000
bunch of improvement in terms of effects

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,599
and feature and

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,359
other stuff that we insert in the

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,560
program during this last

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,640
eight months okay

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,599
we have questions coming in so the first

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,359
one is from

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,760
jonathan krita has had success

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,720
putting it on windows store and steam

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,760
and others

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,880
and selling it and hiring developers

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,720
caden live is another flagship app could

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
could it follow the same model

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,040
there are discussion about

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,839
what's next in term or how we arrange

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,400
the way to deliver the way to interact

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,599
we are very few

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,680
and that is not convenient so we are

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,400
trying to

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,960
collect more people possible by telegram

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,760
by all the channel we are running

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
that yet to be we are already in windows

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,280
you

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,280
you everybody of you know that we would

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,839
like we taking we took in consideration

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,839
the windows store certain point

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,040
but i'm not the person that is uh

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,800
focused on that

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,920
we received from one of our

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,359
support mec macos

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,720
machine my computer to try to finish to

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,200
develop

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,520
and deliver a version for mac because of

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,280
mcu's are very interested in so we are

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,119
happy of that and we would like to

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,320
deliver too

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,839
and we'll see how

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,440
to try in the future maybe to collect

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,320
directly donation if people want to do

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,640
for the moment

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,760
we asked people to donate to kde that

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,079
actually

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,400
found us some operation like the sprint

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,520
and all the important stuff that anyway

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,079
comes to us in any case so yes

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,839
that we are reorganizing and try to

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,440
doing better and to

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,440
to be more people if possible

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,359
okay thank you uh no further questions

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
so i guess thank you all very much

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,800
massimo

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,200
for the presentation i was clear because

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,400
with these technical uh problems i

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,839
really didn't

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,520
understand the setting but what's what

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,599
happening because

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,960
here i'm alone and just playing with the

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,040
computer

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,160
i don't know what happened on the on the

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,920
other side

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,599
well virtual conferencing has it has its

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,800
pros and cons it's true

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,560
okay i hope to be was good enough

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,920
and then we'll see you next time

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,440
probably
