	By Aleix Pol Gonzalez 
In this presentation I'd like to share my experiences with working with the KDE Community both as a Blue Systems employee who has to work as a developer on KDE products. 
I would like also to reflect on the experience of having hired several contractors to work with the KDE community and how we aspire it to work for further positions.
