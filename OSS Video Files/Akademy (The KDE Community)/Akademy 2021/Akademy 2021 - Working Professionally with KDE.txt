Title: Akademy 2021 - Working Professionally with KDE
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Aleix Pol Gonzalez 
In this presentation I'd like to share my experiences with working with the KDE Community both as a Blue Systems employee who has to work as a developer on KDE products. 
I would like also to reflect on the experience of having hired several contractors to work with the KDE community and how we aspire it to work for further positions.

[Music]

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,719
all right

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,880
this is gonna be a bit of a different

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,240
talk than i usually give

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
um i must warn i'm gonna be changing

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,760
hats

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,279
in the middle of uh the talk and this is

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
gonna be an exercise for you because i

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,640
am not wearing a hat now

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,320
also i am not gonna be wearing a hat

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,239
later i did think

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,399
let's do the thing where you have a hat

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,440
and then you change with another hat

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,680
but then i decided don't do that because

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
you don't know how to wear a hat also i

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,840
don't really have hats

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,840
so it would have been a bit awkward

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,320
so instead we're going to start with a

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
slightly confusing

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:59,840
slide of a french landscape

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,840
that maybe some of you will recognize

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
what we are going to talk about today is

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,360
about how

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,320
while we have been working in a highly

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,880
professionalized field like software is

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
and

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,280
while we've been working on on very

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640
difficult

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,759
topics sometimes

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
the professionalization of our space has

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,159
been

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,200
limited and what i would like to do is

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
on the other on the one hand uh offer a

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
perspective of

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,079
what this looks like uh from a first

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:42,079
hand experience and then second um

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,439
put forward the the vision that we

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,520
see from from the kdv on how we can

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,880
improve this situation that that we're

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
in right now

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
so that well we can see people staying

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
around

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,159
for longer time and so that we can have

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,439
people

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,240
um give the attention

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,200
to our products and that our products

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,119
need

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,640
so my first

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,360
had on whoa i'm blurry my first photon

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,040
is the one where i'm called alesh paul i

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
am from barcelona

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
i have been employed by blue systems

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,000
since

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,120
2011 which means that this november

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,720
is gonna be a decade that i've been with

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,440
blue systems

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
i've also uh collaborated with katie in

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,640
the past

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
uh somewhat professionally namely

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,319
through the google summer of code

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,920
program that i imagine that most of you

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,280
have heard of but not exclusively

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
i've done other contracted work as part

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
of my professional life but

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,480
like you can see most of it has been

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
largely

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,840
around kd and

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,840
well proud of it now

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,159
what i wanted to reflect on here is

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
let's say you're a business and you want

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
to work

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,840
uh you want to create a product and you

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,730
see

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,319
kde uh

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,480
[Music]

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,280
credibility's availability over there um

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,480
how do you turn uh what that community

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,720
is pushing forward

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,159
but remembering what kde does is for

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,239
free and you can

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
reuse all of that work for free which is

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,920
well obviously

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,360
uh economically very interesting

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,680
uh that doesn't mean that it's uh

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
unequivocally interesting but it's

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,560
definitely work that you can

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,000
reuse and and and start

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,040
uh working with now um what i

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,040
i suggest all of you who think

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
all right there's a business opportunity

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,159
here how do we

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,560
how do we uh make profit from it

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,480
well what you need to say is all right

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,760
there's all of these components

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,920
that i need uh from kde we've been very

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,879
forward about making our systems very

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
configurable being very reusable we've

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
put forward a lot of framework so that

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,120
you don't

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
have to take all of the all of the

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,359
things so well

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
the first step would definitely be what

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,199
do i need from from

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,000
all of that that stuff no um

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
so the first thing that you will do is

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
look at the

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,880
product let's say you're doing a

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,320
toaster um

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
well you will look at the different

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,360
components that you might need

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,400
maybe you will need solid

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,280
to make sure that you you're warming

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
your hardware at the maximum whatever

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,479
right

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
but the first thing that you will find

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,759
is that

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,639
there is ongoing work there is people

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
who are

00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,080
uh thinking in terms of uh

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
how do they improve their their thing uh

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,759
on a daily basis they definitely don't

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
care about your toaster or whatever

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,720
product you're doing

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,960
or at least they don't care in principle

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
because they have never heard of it

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,880
sometimes even they won't be able to

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
think of it because your

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,160
own employment conditions don't allow

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
them to

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
so the first thing you need to do

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
is to reach out to these people and say

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,759
all right

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,800
what are you people going on about

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,720
uh let's see if we can work together

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
um and is this this step where you start

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
understanding what they do

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
and what drives them that well it's the

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,520
first

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,680
moment where you can measure um

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,199
what kind of involvement and what kind

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,919
of collaboration you can establish at

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
this point right

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,039
then uh as soon as you decide that this

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
makes sense and obviously it makes a lot

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,039
of sense to

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
to do it with kd because obviously gedi

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,759
is a

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
very nice community to work with

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
but what you will have to do is to start

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
to coordinate with these people

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
because you will have certain interests

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
um

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,240
i now realize that my example of the

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,039
toaster was um

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,039
very bad uh excuse it but i guess that

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,840
you understand what i am talking about

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,520
anyway um

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,160
you will have to go to the solid people

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
you will have to go to the maybe plaza

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
people and say

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,720
all right i need this this set of

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
changes

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,199
to happen how do we make it uh possible

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,240
and and

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
available to to us to be able to create

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,280
our own product right

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,960
and it's at that moment

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,560
when you start to see well the kind of

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,319
of work you will end up doing because

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,759
like we established in the beginning

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
uh you won't be doing all of your

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,639
product from scratch like

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,599
admittedly a big part of the success of

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,160
free software

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
has been that now nowadays people don't

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
have to ever

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,440
again do a product from scratch because

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,360
they always have something to

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,319
set uh their their their feet on right

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,039
uh i can imagine i i i wasn't doing

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,479
products back then but like 25 years ago

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,479
people well did start creating a

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,160
tiny kernel for every little product

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,840
that they were doing

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,919
uh right now big parts of the success of

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,280
such very important projects like the

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,560
linux kernel

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,400
or even android indeed has been that

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,360
they are free software and then people

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,440
can leverage them

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,599
and this means that you don't ever need

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,840
to start the project from scratch

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,199
and what we now think that is from

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,400
scratch it's never

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,599
us from scratch as well it

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,879
probably once was

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,160
um in kde we offered the opportunity for

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,120
people to define their from scratch to a

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
fairly high level

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,599
area as long as they collaborate with us

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
and as long as

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
we can find common spaces where to where

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,160
to work together

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,080
that of course goes in in line with well

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,360
being able to work properly with

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,479
uh products like cute for example or or

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,560
maybe nowadays whalen etc

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,879
right now it keeps happening

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
that

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,159
people look that look at our stuff and

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
say

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
all right i'm gonna pick this thing i'm

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
gonna fork it

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
and i'm gonna use it to make my

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,039
brilliant lovely toaster

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
because i i know so much better than

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,600
these

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,600
poor people how

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,279
how to create my product but in practice

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,839
uh at least it has been my experience

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
that

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,640
this is always a narrow-minded position

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,399
whenever you create a product for

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,040
example at the very least

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
or in the european union any electronics

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,920
you need to have a two years warranty

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
right

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,519
and what you can say all right as long

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,640
as i don't touch it

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,320
i i will be able to continue

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,600
supporting this thing but

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
we've all seen this falling apart every

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,600
now and then

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,080
um the continuing the development of of

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
of devices has been a big problem it's

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,760
something that we can very clearly see

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,760
in in the case of of of android where

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,839
um you see devices that have been

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,480
uh announced with the greatest of honors

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,080
that they disappear from the market as

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,760
soon as a new version

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,680
of android arrives because well

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,880
nobody dares to um

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,399
to port that over and the very reason or

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,000
that this is happening

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,760
is the very reason that it has it

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,240
happens when people fork

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
us or they fork the linux kernel which

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
is

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,120
you need to do a lot of work to be able

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,160
to to maintain over time

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,480
uh certain stack and and i don't think

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,920
that

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,079
any any of us are are interested in

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
in collaborating with products that will

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,000
that you know for

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
for for certain that as soon as the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
newest

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,720
you know or the next linux kernel that

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,959
that happens the next

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,240
version of whatever appears you won't be

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,160
able to support it and

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
you will start to pile up on back

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,600
reports that you

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,760
know that you cannot fix because they

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
your changes won't reach the

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,399
deliverables that you give

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,640
to your users or or so

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,600
um this is something that we for example

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,880
also discussed

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
very uh about at length when when

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
talking about

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,320
apps we don't want to be to create apps

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,480
that when we fix them our users

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
don't don't uh don't get the fix well if

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
you

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
forget one of our apps because you

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,079
needed to add an icon you needed to add

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,200
a new button

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,040
then from that moment every fix

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
that anyone from the kitty community

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,440
does or

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,320
everything that anyone else does in

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
in that product it won't reach the users

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,920
which is by the way

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,320
probably the number one frustration of

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
every free software hacker and developer

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079
and contributor

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,519
that has ever existed the impossibility

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
of being able to

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
address something that you know how to

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,800
address it's just that you know that

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,800
somebody decided that

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,480
well therefore was uh more important

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
than

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,519
being able to uh solve issues so

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
in practice what i wanted to say is that

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,920
if you're working on

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,800
free software products and

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,519
um you have to take this decision

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
between

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,519
do i collaborate or do i just fork well

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,800
tom ford

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:09,440
work with us make it possible for us to

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,160
to to work together and and create a

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,920
strategy that that spans over the years

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,279
rather than a couple of campaigns

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:21,680
for creating tiny abs or whatever

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,680
that that could make sense um

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,920
yeah i think it's it's obvious enough um

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,240
so what it does it look like when you

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,680
know that you're creating something

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,079
that works together with the rest of

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,519
of of our community because in practice

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,839
the community

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,000
will still not uh bend over your will

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
obviously and understandably and as it

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
should be

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,160
but um while you still need to have this

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,360
kind of assurance

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,800
well we've seen this happen uh

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,160
in several locations around uh there's

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,519
very successful uh projects uh all over

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,120
the place that

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,880
do uh partnerships with different uh

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
companies and it's a matter of share

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,680
responsibilities if you

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
your organization shows that as

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,519
long as you use that product that

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,079
product is not gonna break

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,320
if uh when you contribute things they

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
don't break it for other people

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,600
if you sometimes even put something on

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,720
the table that

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
the rest of the team maybe wanted but

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,880
never

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,240
uh found the time to do it will make it

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,959
easier also for them

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,440
to decide that at some point to say all

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,560
right

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
uh let's work together let's see uh what

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,839
i can do for you or in practice just

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,800
they will be testing it

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,360
and they will be using it and if there's

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,240
a small pet peeve that they find

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,519
that isn't well something that you never

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,440
found or you

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,040
didn't care or because it's not the

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
hardware you're just testing on

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,639
they will fix it and this is something

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,000
very important right because when the

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
next version of your product

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
happens well it will be tested on

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,240
another software and you will have a

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,839
much

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,160
uh wider portfolio by the way i think

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,639
that i am saying very obvious things

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,639
but i also had the feeling when i was

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,079
preparing this song that

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,720
there's very obvious things that we

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,120
never say and then

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,880
i never know if it's obvious to everyone

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,160
so i might be

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,839
captain obvious today if i if i am

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,839
well i'm sorry

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,839
so tiny the button so in practice

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,279
there's this weird sentence i put

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,440
together here but it's about

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,480
helping the community help you to help

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
them and

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,959
maybe we can uh look at it from

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,480
from the end right like as as soon as

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,480
you help the community

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,600
uh to some extent the the local teams

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,920
they will accept you as part of of their

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,800
team as part of their community

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,160
which is going to mean that they will be

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
able to help you right

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,320
as soon as you start contributing to

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,160
them as soon as you start

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,800
reviewing their merch requests as soon

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,800
as you start

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:24,320
well making sure that the project

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,839
moves forward uh well

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,839
it's already a mutual uh hub which will

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,600
also mean that they will be helping you

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
right because if

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
you're working as a team uh whatever

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,880
they do it

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,279
it should also have an impact on what

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,759
you do at least on a bigger picture

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,920
kind of perspective and of course this

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,560
also means that you sometimes

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,519
have to uh develop certain things a bit

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,880
slower

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,880
but um i have had

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
this feeling of telling people you know

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,839
this saying

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,240
of uh if you want to go uh

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
quick go alone if you want to go far go

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
together

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
i think that free software is all about

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,880
that right

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,759
it's about making sure that in the

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,639
longer run

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,160
we can still support each other uh of

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,959
course that you can

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,800
do the very specific things if you just

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,160
forget about these people who have their

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,600
own

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,120
kind of thoughts that uh are not yours

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,720
and your thoughts are always better and

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,440
more important and interesting

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:32,560
but in practice if kd is still here

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,839
it's because uh what we create at large

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
is more important than the specific

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,600
ideas that everybody had

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,000
but also that the specific ideas that

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,040
everybody had ended up creating what we

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,040
reached out uh

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
which is especially important this year

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,160
right like we're celebrating 25 years

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
this is an amazing field and it only

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,199
speaks

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,279
for all of the people who have been

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,320
putting their small thoughts and

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,320
well working together

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,280
to to create this big thing

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,919
now it's about a matter of talking to

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,520
people

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,559
um it can be very hard to some people i

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,559
guess

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,559
it's definitely harder nowadays that

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,720
we're in a pandemic and we don't get

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,760
get to hug each other i can promise you

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,880
those of you who were not around when

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,360
we actually used to meet that we didn't

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
used to punch each other so that was a

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,240
nice thing

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,280
there was much more hugging and and and

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,400
discussions right

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,200
uh even as as luna was talking about

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
earlier

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960
like there's a lot of friendships that

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,080
have been created

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,720
by this mirror talking to people and all

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,799
of the

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
a lot of the discussion of the of the

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,360
discussions that nuno had with

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,480
uh people a lot of the friends he made

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
and i'm sure that

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,160
a lot of the rest of us i know that from

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,440
myself as well

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,280
they have been uh well friendships

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,440
not only based about the technical

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,880
topics but

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,600
well also business topics and beyond and

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
and this is very important because it

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,320
also

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
brings new opportunities that are not

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,880
the

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
whatever reason that you approach the

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,679
community in the first place

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,640
but um the fact that you are in that

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,160
conversation

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
also makes you a little bit more

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
powerful

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,679
but to be able to be in that position

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,600
when when you can have a

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,440
truthful and honest conversation with

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,120
with the community you need to be clear

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,120
it happens sometimes that people say

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,880
i won't like to create this product

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,200
around or

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,960
i come from a company right and they

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,760
have 25 mbas

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
and they have they cannot really tell

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
you

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,440
anything but they're very demanding of

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
course because

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
well they know what they're talking

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
about but you don't

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,720
and then you end up in this position of

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,720
all right you do your thing

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,000
and then i'm gonna i'm gonna worry

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,280
myself about

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,160
my own problems but in practices

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,000
this is how you end up having a fork and

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,440
thinking that you're amazing

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,760
but this is also how you end up making

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
kd not as good as it could have been

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
because i am sure that

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,280
part of those ideas behind the nda were

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,640
useful

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,440
and also as soon as you fork like i was

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
saying

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,520
uh you also end up in a position where

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
all of the work in in in kde

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,760
also doesn't apply to you and it puts

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,160
you also in a worse position

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,039
being transparent is also even very

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
related

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,480
uh if people see what you're doing they

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
will

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
also be able to get excited about what

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
you're doing

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,200
and even we want to be part of it if

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,320
you're transparent about what you're

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,000
doing

00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,240
uh people might want to join you even

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,760
to be hired by you at some point and

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,360
if you're transparent they will see the

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,559
value of what you're doing

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,799
and maybe let you do your thing

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
and they will be doing their thing and

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,840
together we will

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,080
create something amazing being reliable

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,200
is also goes in the part of the

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,360
conversation right

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,360
like you can be saying a lot of nice

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,120
things a lot of people are very good at

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,520
saying nice things but in the end they

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,480
don't end up delivering and it's also

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,320
something that it

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,360
it's frustrating because you have this

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,600
company or this

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,880
group of people who say we're gonna do

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,400
all of these things

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,200
and then until the changes don't get

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
into your

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,799
git repository you feel like it's it's

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,799
not

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,360
getting there but then as soon as it

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,840
does as soon as you see that

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,080
well the changes got there that you're

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,640
leveraging whatever feature whatever

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,760
uh contribution whatever set of icons

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
whatever ideas

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,559
that were put on the table well then you

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,679
have the opportunity of

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,559
of um having that conversation that you

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,240
wanted to have

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,840
and even have it on the on the longer

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,120
run because in practice i don't think

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,159
that anyone looks

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,039
at any professional uh problem

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,240
in a short term at least not someone who

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,400
really wants to

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,080
uh produce something that matters to

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,799
their their clients

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,480
when when you talk to about things that

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,280
matter you talk about

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
uh longer runs even longer runs that we

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,280
can afford

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
from within kde so it's also uh

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,480
something that uh different kind of

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
product

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,919
a different kind of organization can

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,720
also help us offer right

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,880
because um well the nature of open

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
source i would say and free software is

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
that you need to be slightly quite

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
quickly paced

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,240
and so that people can join and help

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,240
as soon as they can

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,320
now this is a blue systems meeting for

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,520
from

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,640
2016. i would like to say that

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,240
uh i couldn't find any picture that is

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,840
more recent because

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,720
i couldn't find it well no it i didn't

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,640
find anyone

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
because i couldn't find it you will uh

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,520
know most of the people those of you who

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,760
have been around in kde

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,039
those all who you don't well you can

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
research them they're all very nice

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,600
people

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,440
half of them are not with blue systems

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,360
anymore but also this is

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
kind of how it works most of them though

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,039
have stayed around

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,720
in the kd community which also speaks

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,360
for how important

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,400
uh sitting your your your business on a

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,400
reliable community it means

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,080
um well as i am talking to the systems

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,039
people right now for a second

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,000
uh thank you very much for this almost

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,000
10 years right now

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
but now it's the moment where i'm gonna

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,520
change my virtual hat

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,640
because in virtual conferences you have

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,640
virtual hats

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,039
i don't know if you know and now i

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,400
remove my blue systems

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,039
person hat and i put my kitty hacker hat

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,480
on

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,159
my nowadays kdb president

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,640
had on i've been on the kdb board

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,919
for the last uh seven years i checked

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,280
yesterday

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,000
well month plus or minus but

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,000
more or less that

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,960
and i've been in kde developers for the

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,440
last 14 years so

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,960
i guess i am in the in the middle of the

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,240
scale right now

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,480
and what i'm gonna talk to

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,400
you about now is a little bit how

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
everything i discussed earlier relates

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,120
to

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,480
what um well to my my persona right now

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,360
with this hat

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,679
and as well how we are trying to fix the

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,520
the problems of how hard it is to become

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,520
a professional around haiti

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,960
and and and continue continue

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,440
contributing when you

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,840
realize that but you're not a student

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,760
anymore and you need to

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:11,600
pay certain bills with any hat

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
also comes a glad of glass of water

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,919
so um for the longest time

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,400
kdev started in 1999

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,679
but well for me actually the important

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,279
thing is that kde started in 1996

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:37,039
which it's gonna be 25 years this year

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:40,400
second mention but it wasn't

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:43,279
until 2017 when we hired the

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
first people to work actively with the

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,600
community

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,400
we uh the kidv had had uh

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,000
people before uh namely claudia hi

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
claudia if you're watching

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and and petra later on but they were

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,799
more on the administration side

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and at some point and for different

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,159
circumstances we decided

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
to hire a couple of marketing

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,760
coordinators

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,120
and i think that this was uh

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,360
one of the biggest changes that i've

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,559
seen from

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,760
well working in kde in that

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,880
well first we were all uh

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
trying to do our best and in our free

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
time

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,840
meaning not that i think that the

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,559
contractors don't

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,559
but uh at some point we decided to okay

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,960
let's introduce two different

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,320
people who are gonna fill in a position

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
that uh

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,919
should have been filled in by the

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,559
community but

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,400
for any kind of reason it's not really

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,720
working out

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
um

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,919
and i am talking about this because um

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
well

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,240
you will have seen lydia's and nyofido's

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,440
presentation the other day about make a

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,679
living

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,880
we're suggesting a certain amount of

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,559
changes

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,720
and and i think that it's important that

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,000
well somebody talks about this at some

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,000
point right

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,720
um what's the big difference between

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,159
uh well my former had about being a blue

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,120
systems person

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,679
um the hat that i don't wear but the hat

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,880
that

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,520
the contractors nowadays wear and

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,360
the hud that most of you as community

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,720
members wear right

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:37,120
um well in blue systems namely

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,240
i basically have a boss that tells me

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,559
what to do which well it generally has

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,559
been aligned with what kde has

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,080
uh needed and you have you will have

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,919
seen a lot of my colleagues

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,679
as well as myself working together with

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,000
you but

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,919
also you have seen people from other

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,080
organizations that

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,000
well they joined with kde when they

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,360
needed something from kd

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,039
but well only then

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,520
the big difference here with the

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,640
contractors is that

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,559
they get hired to fulfill the vision of

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,679
uh of kde at large and well

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,279
necessarily uh subpart

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,799
section of of our our community

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,919
in the case of the marketing people we

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,679
hire them to help with the promotion of

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:33,760
of our products and helping us

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,960
get out there but also always with

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:41,039
the the background of

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,399
what kitty is what kitty stands for and

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:47,440
well furthering that because well kdv

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:53,120
which is committed to supporting kde

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,120
uh is well hiring them for that right

00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,240
and this is a challenge right this is a

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,240
challenge because

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:07,039
you become this one person that uh

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,600
is working among a lot of people who are

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,640
in a community doing their thing

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,159
casually

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,039
and well first they are they have to

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,559
work a

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:22,159
minimum amount of hours or

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,000
i mean with the hr

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,440
understanding of the minimum amount of

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,480
hours it's not like

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,679
we're forcing them to work but uh

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,919
well it's their duty to to work on uh

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,679
for these hours on a certain topic

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,440
and as such uh they need to coordinate

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,360
with a community of people a community

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,520
let's remember that wasn't uh

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,799
all that active uh at least when they

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,480
start because

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,120
if an area of kde is generally populated

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,200
but we're not gonna hire people to to

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,080
work on it right

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,120
uh and and make it alive and make it do

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,960
things

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,840
and well also try to work with people

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,000
who

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,760
all don't have all of the time on in in

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,720
the world and when they do have time

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,399
they do

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,440
work on the things that they feel like

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,159
it's fun and and interesting

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,080
but um i think that it's also very

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,679
important that we look at this

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,480
as an opportunity and well i am not only

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,880
talking

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,000
here to the actual contractors but that

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,200
we see

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,840
like the rest of us as well um

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,760
it's an opportunity for kitty to have

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,320
something that

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,440
organically didn't get filled there

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,120
there's things that

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,320
humans we're not always interested in in

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,600
working on

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,919
um like you could say promo and by the

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,799
way

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,240
for example the case of promo we had had

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,760
people working on the community

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,039
actively in the in the past it never was

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,960
ideal

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,760
arguably but we always did things

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,679
but it's it's important that we see that

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,360
we have the opportunity right now

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,120
because marketing or maybe the

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,000
documentation case is

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,640
is more relatable we have uh

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,320
we have had documentation over the last

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,840
25 years i am sure

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,720
that one of the first commits that

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,640
someone did in in kde was to add the

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,840
first documentation because

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,720
while explaining how things work the

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,559
apis and technical documentation be it

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,840
user documentation

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,399
is is something important but then

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,679
um well i don't know i i don't really

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,520
see the chat but

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,799
raise your hand if you love working on

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
documentation

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,159
uh because while the next question is

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,840
why were you not working on

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,200
documentation much more

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,000
uh in the past um it's an opportunity to

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,039
see that kde has the mechanism right now

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,679
to

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,440
well articulate work in that area so

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,279
that actually people can continue

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,480
working on what they're passionate about

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,679
what they want to do

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,600
which is something that i have the

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,399
feeling that we in kde we do generally

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,679
well

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,720
um we've had people work uh

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,320
on very hard topics in the past and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,080
and resolve them with excellence

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,200
uh the fact that there's hundreds

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,519
thousands millions of computers in the

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,559
around the world running our software is

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,360
nothing but proof of it right

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,360
uh and one can only expect that if we

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,200
manage to polish these

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,240
parts that are the least attended uh

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,399
we will be able to reach different parts

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,000
from our community that

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,799
were never been able to reach before

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,760
and this just happens by working with

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,679
the community

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,200
it's even working from within the

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,640
community these people

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,640
are put there in the middle and say

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,640
now do free software things

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,440
which is basically what we end up doing

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,559
when

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,320
we when we join kd i mean

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,880
of course when you join kde you say

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,360
i have this great idea and i'm gonna put

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,919
it in

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,919
practice my my personally first

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,600
contribution to kitty was

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,279
well working in k algebra and actually

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,240
algebra itself so

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,440
it's not like i arrived one day and i

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,200
didn't really know what to do

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,640
and it's not like our contractors really

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,679
don't know what to do right

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,720
but it still is well being put in

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,000
the position where you have to work with

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,840
new people or maybe all people from

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,840
from a slightly privileged

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,200
circumstance which is just at least

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,519
that you have some time that you have to

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,559
spend

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,559
on a certain topic

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
beyond the positions we already

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,080
discussed well there's also the make a

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,840
living position for

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:07,120
positions that uh well i'm not gonna

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,159
talk about a lot here because

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,600
um well like we said

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:17,519
also discussed it but

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:21,600
they are also again another uh

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,640
well moving a bit uh closer to the daily

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
uh matters of our community we're a

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,440
community

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,440
that creates free software and

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,440
they are going to be people creating

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,360
part of this resolver

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,519
they are positions that have been

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,000
designed specifically to further certain

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,200
areas

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,559
of our community that

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,039
what we feel that can can expand our

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,799
reach

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:52,159
in ways that well i cannot really

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,320
scream enough to people work on this and

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
it's gonna be amazing even if i am

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,880
wearing that

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,360
magnificent uh president hat i don't

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,159
know if you imagine the present hat

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,480
but i think that it looks a bit like a

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,950
wizard hat like

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,380
like um

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,380
[Music]

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:19,119
candle kind of left us

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:22,639
but the president we have a mystical hat

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,919
virtual hat that we pass on

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,960
in lydia it looked a bit too big

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,879
but it's also looked amazing but anyway

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,240
i'm gonna try to remove that image from

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,159
your heads

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,159
and and continue on the topic

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,200
so for those of you who haven't seen the

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,760
presentations

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,560
we're gonna have three new positions one

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,520
that is

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,240
uh working on what we call base software

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,560
which is

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,280
at least to be defined but it basically

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,720
should be

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,079
stuff along the lines of cute frameworks

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,839
kd frameworks

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,680
uh maybe well some underlying

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,880
uh we might have to be

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,920
uh addressed upstream but

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,119
in general the idea is to make sure that

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,200
people can create

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,280
with what we create and within us

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,560
with the best of assurances we'll have a

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,440
person who will

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:28,720
uh work and think about how to make

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,599
hardware projects from within kde like

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,079
like some

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,040
projects that we've already seen lately

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,640
and

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,480
well facilitated uh there's always

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,400
certain small annoyances that are

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,880
generally not even within

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,599
our uh repositories in our code bases

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,960
but that without these things being so

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,359
getting solved

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,920
well your products never uh flourish

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,400
like we always expected they would

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,079
well this little wizard will help us

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,200
with that

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,560
and then a third position who will be a

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,359
person helping us get uh in

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,520
certain app stores and making sure that

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,800
everyone around the world can somewhat

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,360
reach our software and well make best

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,640
use of it

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,599
[Music]

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,920
because in practice what we create is

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,440
for

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,440
for everyone to enjoy not

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:29,839
a select number of people anyway right

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,359
now maybe this is the weird part of my

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,839
talk but i think that is the more

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,800
most important part as well like how do

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,920
i help

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,400
how what is my role and by my role i

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,800
don't mean

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,640
alicia's role with any of the hats but

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,640
like any of ours

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,640
who are from part of this community

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,560
in making sure that this is a success

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,200
um kdv is spending a

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,000
sizable amount of money in in in doing

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,400
this

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,480
and what we're doing it's because we

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,000
think that it's very important that

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,520
uh kde is catered for

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,640
also because we have to for legal

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,079
reasons to uh well not have

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,920
surpluses but in practice to make sure

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:21,680
that the kd community doesn't

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,520
stagnate in the comfort zone of

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,680
whatever the status quo is right now

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,680
right

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,800
now uh how can you help well you

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,880
should be working with these people uh

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,760
the new contractors and even

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,160
the previous ones like they they are

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,440
fellow community members you don't

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,079
need to treat them like they are blessed

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,640
which somebody some people might think

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,800
uh

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,760
or have thought in the past that they

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,079
were

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,079
but also you don't have to just uh

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,160
let them do their thing in a corner

00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,440
right you need to be able to

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,720
communicate with them you need to

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,599
communicate with them you need to make

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,320
sure

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,000
that you understand how they work and

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,400
what they're working on much like you

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,440
need

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,640
to understand how your other teammates

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,920
uh work

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
because like i was saying earlier

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,680
if we're not transparent with each other

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,480
it's very complicated to work together

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,480
properly right

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,760
something that is also very important is

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,440
that

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,440
we need to work in the same direction

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,599
here we could show this cheesy picture

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,960
of two dogs

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,800
pulling on on a different side or

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
pulling on on the same direction

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,119
obviously those pulling in the same

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,280
direction will always

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:50,240
go faster and further um

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,240
i think that the

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,920
all of the positions that we've put

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,839
forward they're very

00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,920
uh exciting for anyone in the community

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:04,000
um and working with them

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,440
can only mean that your contributions

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,520
will be

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,960
more valuable more relevant in the

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,720
longer run than

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,119
they would be if you were working alone

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,480
because in practice the

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,200
this everything boils down to uh

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,040
if you're in a company and you work

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,119
alone nothing works if you're in the

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,200
community and you work alone

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,960
nothing really works and if you're a

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,560
contractor and you work alone

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,720
nothing really works but if we work

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,720
together well we're onto something right

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,119
something that also is important

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,720
especially

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,440
when they begin is that some of us we've

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,880
been around

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,760
for a very very long time and we know a

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,480
lot of

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,200
unspoken rules within the community well

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,680
first of all

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,440
we shouldn't have unspoken rules or on

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,150
written rules or whatever

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,119
we should be able to um

00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,880
[Music]

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,520
well to express what are our

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,720
ways to work in general we've done a lot

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,480
of work with this

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,960
with the manifesto with the um

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,640
well with our vision with the statues of

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,440
the kv if you wish

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,560
but in practice there's always uh

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,960
certain things that

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,599
one needs to know one is to know who's

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,640
who

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:28,240
um assuming that they uh

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,160
that they know also doesn't help

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,319
anything but uh

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,280
maybe something that you can uh help

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,200
with is by

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:41,839
offering this um this experience right

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,240
so that we need to understand that none

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,960
of the contractors have magical powers

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,520
not the ones that we have right now and

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,560
i

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,960
would safely admit that i don't think

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,400
that we're gonna hire anyone with

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,520
magical powers

00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,280
um everyone's

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,880
hours are limited um they are

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,839
for those people in the community and

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,520
they are for those people uh

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,560
contracted um

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,119
well let's understand that and and like

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,359
it was

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,640
saying earlier earlier let's talk to

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,480
each other like

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,079
like peers and equals which is what we

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,680
are uh

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,440
even if there are some people who have

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,560
well the small um

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,560
advantage of being

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,800
well contracted to for a few hours to

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,800
work on certain things

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,359
um something that a lot of people fear

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,960
and

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,960
well you should not just

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,480
maybe fear but actually like work

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,640
against this

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,880
we should be taking and doing the work

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,920
that we wanted to do anyway

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,560
we should well don't be afraid of taking

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,760
tasks because somebody is

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,440
contracted around the topic or the area

00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,079
if you are very interested in android

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,599
don't stop yourself working on android

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,800
topics because there's

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,440
an apps contractor if you're very

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,720
passionate

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,119
about youtube videos like nikolai's for

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,400
example

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,000
don't stop yourself from doing it

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,200
because there's probably it wouldn't

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,240
make any sense right

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,040
it wouldn't make it better for them and

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,040
it wouldn't

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,960
make it better for you because in

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,599
practice our resources are always

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,800
limited

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,079
and they are for everyone it's also very

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,400
important that um

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,319
let me turn the lights on because it got

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,839
really dark

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,680
it's very important that you apply the

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,920
positions as they appear

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:45,200
the the better candidates we have

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,240
the better we will be able to have uh

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,079
outcomes positive outcomes in practice

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,480
um there's always a certain

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,480
onboarding time that is necessary and it

00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,319
will be the case for anyone

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,520
but if you've been around for a long

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,680
time if you are

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,319
familiar with the topic it will always

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,040
be a bit a bit easier

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,400
for you to to join and help in and in

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,160
practice reach out

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,359
uh reach out to us as the kdp board

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,000
if you wish reach out to the

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,280
contractors if you want to talk to them

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,119
because like i said

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,960
they don't have magical powers which

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,520
also means that they don't do these

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,319
uh weird electric great things

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,359
we also we always should be able to talk

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,760
to each other

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,119
and it's only by both having the

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,839
discussions

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,119
that we will be able to well work better

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,870
together right

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,119
but um what i want you to uh

00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,800
[Music]

00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,160
to think about is that this is a

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,920
collective opportunity

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,359
this is not just the thing that the kdp

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,359
is doing nowadays

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,400
but that it's our chance we have

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,599
to uh to attain

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,560
certain uh opportunities that right now

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,359
have been

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
just unattainable to us and it's gonna

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,319
be

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,280
through well hard work because i am sure

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,440
that all of the

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,440
people we have and we will have on board

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,560
will work hard to

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,359
drive us in this direction and if we

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,800
help them if we

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,520
work together we will be able to uh well

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,680
reach millions of people through our app

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,119
we will be able to

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,119
uh will help lots of developers start

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,400
developing our application applications

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,720
for us with us

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,720
through better documentation through um

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,880
well better based software so that they

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,800
don't have to start

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,160
well working around problems we might

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,000
have in our base

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,040
systems but just doing their things

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,560
right um

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,240
embracing this collective opportunity

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,000
you can only

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,839
uh well

00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,680
take us to the other side and i am sure

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,359
that there's uh

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,640
good things to to have to find there and

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,880
this only can happen by working together

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,079
this is the academy presentation for

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,000
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,520
because like i said earlier i suck at

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
looking for pictures

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,160
i also i'm a bit tired of seeing the

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,680
milan picture when we have a normal

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,599
academy picture so

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,480
2018. um

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,319
it's it's very nice working with you all

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,640
and

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,480
it's going to continue to be amazing i

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,359
wanted to

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,359
talk a little bit about the future but i

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,560
think that here's the important thing is

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,319
that

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,079
uh well let's focus on what we have

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,720
on the table like

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,839
carpe diem a little bit uh let's embrace

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,359
this opportunity

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,359
let's uh make sure that

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,319
that we make the most of it and make

00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:03,520
sure that uh

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,520
well all of these goals that we had are

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,520
with our read uh when when the time

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,359
comes and

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,640
well then we get to talk about the

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,160
future about

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,040
uh well what how has our organization

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,480
changed

00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,400
after uh after this work and

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,119
how do we make the best of it like we're

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,040
doing nowadays right

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,839
carpe diem now

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,839
this is a picture

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,960
okay this is this is karma

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,640
this was the picture of my desk because

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,240
adam didn't show it yesterday

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,280
and i am sure that adam today hacked my

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,200
pdf

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,350
to not show my desk once more so

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,400
that's on you adam

00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:57,200
[Music]

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,760
it wasn't all that interesting anyway so

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,319
um if you have any questions that's

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,839
probably

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,560
a good moment to have a bit of a

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:08,640
conversation if there's some time

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,680
otherwise uh well you can reach me at

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,160
this is my name this is my email this is

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,599
my

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,079
matrix handle down there and the

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,440
the other one is all my telegram and

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,079
twitter as well and

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,520
mastodon because i am not very original

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,119
with my

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,119
my name so

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,520
what's everyone

00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,760
thank you very much alex for this

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,160
presentation

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,520
i'm glad that the hack was successful

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,960
and you did not

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:50,559
sidestep my uh my ban on your

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,599
desk pictures um so we do have a

00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,240
question already

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,839
in the widget here from the audience by

00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,680
the way you probably missed because you

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,720
you had the presentation but there's

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,079
already a

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:09,359
a candle photoshop with your face on

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,160
you'll probably be being sent shortly

00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,160
after

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,920
after the presentation i'm sure so the

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,240
question comes from jonathan rito

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,160
we have a goal to get more apps on more

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,960
app stores but haven't attracted many

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,599
people

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,400
to do that fairly easily grant work of

00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,480
packaging

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,520
apps should we i'm not sure which of

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,640
your many hats this

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,559
is aimed at

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,760
i am super sorry but can you repeat the

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,800
question please

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,000
sure we have our goal to get more apps

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:41,200
on more app stores but haven't attracted

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,680
many people to do the fairly easy grand

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,160
work

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,160
of packaging apps should we

00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,000
i i must disagree there's a lot of

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:56,480
people in kde who have been

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,480
doing this work it's a matter of

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,559
making sure that their work is

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,559
compensated somehow

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,319
i think that big part of the problem

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,319
with

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,559
being a free software hacker in your

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,520
free time is that

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,040
the challenging problems are interesting

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,880
but the

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,079
most boring ones that are boring um

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,480
and we have seen what people people

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,760
pumping the packaging for example on

00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,680
windows on mac on

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,839
a snap on flat right

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,280
at this point we need to do the extra

00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,640
mile work right which

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,319
uh includes qa it includes uh

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,079
actual just testing that things work

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,760
reaching out to different applications

00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,880
and see how

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,319
how they want to do that um

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,359
and i have the feeling that the people

00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,640
who have been

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:59,520
uh doing this work well it wasn't

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,839
their persona right um if you're the

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,960
kind of person who will

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,599
sit down in front of your computer at

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,040
midnight

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,559
with a well cup of coffee

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,160
or a cup of beer and and start hacking

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,480
maybe you're not the kind of person who

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,559
will

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,160
go chasing around different people and

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,760
doing qi on applications

00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,160
this is this is uh i guess but i think

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,960
that

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,319
it makes sense and actually i would say

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,200
does it make sense to you two

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,720
it doesn't need to be you adam but maybe

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,400
whoever is listening

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,400
although if you want to speak your mind

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,960
i don't mind

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,359
um i think i'd rather go to the next

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,559
question

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,760
not to discuss too much on the

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,839
q a part of the talk uh this next one

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,680
comes from abbots

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,960
from your perspective what seems to be

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,440
the biggest fear

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,640
in hiring contractors and have them work

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,640
along with volunteers

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,680
well we've had this discussion in the

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,680
past

00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,960
i think that it was very strongly

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,319
ingrained in our

00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:16,000
dna at some point maybe not the dna

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:19,920
but maybe in our psych

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,839
that um we didn't hire we did the work

00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,280
in our free time and that's how we

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,680
managed to do all

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,200
of the things and well we've admittedly

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,920
gone a long way

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:34,480
um one of the obvious fears could be

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,839
that if somebody now is being paid to do

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,119
something

00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:42,160
why should i sit down at midnight with a

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:46,079
cup of coffee slash beer and start

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,720
hacking on that packaging i care about

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,599
and my personal conclusion and what i

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,440
think that

00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,640
have been discussed with the different

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,160
people also

00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,160
when we were doing for example to make a

00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,440
living thing is that

00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,960
um we generally do this thing because it

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,559
matters to us

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,079
and we do the thing we want to do but

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,000
there's always going to be certain

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,200
things that we're not going to want to

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,559
do that much

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,400
um for example there's

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,760
piles of our contractors work that

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,480
they're doing nowadays and they're doing

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,559
excellent

00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,839
that i have never done and it hasn't

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,520
been by chance it's

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:26,240
maybe not in my uh

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,440
soul to do that uh maybe i should have

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,359
been doing it but then

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,520
it this would also have meant that i

00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,079
would not have been doing other things

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,520
right

00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:38,720
so in practice the fear is

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,079
will they be taking my my tasks

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:44,559
will they be will i lose uh

00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,119
will to work on the project will i be

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,440
jealous

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,440
of certain contractors because they're

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,000
being paid and i am not

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,880
and i think that we shouldn't be jealous

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,960
i think that we

00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,000
are mature enough to be able to work

00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,280
together

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,240
but i don't know i mean maybe whoever

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,400
did the question i

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,280
sorry didn't hear the name properly

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,760
maybe they

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,040
cannot see themselves being jealous and

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,079
that's how it should be

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,880
uh in practice we've all seen that we

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,680
can

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,000
have some people in our community being

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,480
paid

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,440
for the work they they're doing and we

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,359
can also

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,170
appreciate i would say the work they do

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,280
rather than just be jealous and saying

00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,680
[Music]

00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,559
which i think it's it's it's great and

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,079
it speaks of

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,079
our maturity and i think that we can

00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,520
only use this opportunity to do better

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,680
software than to be better to one

00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,680
another

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,440
okay thank you very much for the answer

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,800
just uh as a side note

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:47,359
as a contractor for the kde v myself i

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,240
can say that being a contractor has

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,119
integrated me more with the community

00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,160
then

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,240
i'm not sure exactly how lsi could be so

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,000
much so quickly integrated so

00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,280
that's also something to keep in mind

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,160
maybe that's a presentation you should

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,800
be doing next academy right

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,599
maybe maybe those are all the questions

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,359
that we

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:13,040
have thank you very much again alex for

00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,040

00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,680
