Title: Akademy 2021 - Qt Design Studio: an Introduction
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Thomas Hartmann
QML, a user interface markup language, is part of the Qt framework. QML is a declarative language (like CSS and JSON). Qt Quick is the name of the QML based framework for defining modern user interfaces.
To break the cycle of painstaking feedback loops between designers and developers the Qt Company is also developing Qt Design Studio a graphical editor for Qt Quick and QML. Qt Design Studio comes also as a free community version for non-commercial users and is available for Linux.
This talk is showing how Qt Design Studio with Qt and QtQuick can be used to create applications with a modern user interface and how to involve UX designers in the development process.
The free community version is freely available for non-commercial users and can be utilized to improve and speed up the development of Qt/QML Open Source applications.

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,639
hello welcome to cute design studio

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,320
introduction

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,279
so i'm thomas hartman i can briefly talk

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
about myself

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
so i'm a senior r d manager for the cute

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,560
company

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,400
and i lead the berlin team that works on

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,760
cube design studio

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,079
i joined actually troll tech in 2006

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,440
worked on various topics one of my first

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
assignments was

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
industry worked without creator did

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,239
consultancy

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,760
but in the last years i've mostly worked

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,120
on what's cute quick designer and now

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,719
cute design studio

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,239
so oop i skipped one slide sorry

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,480
so first i want to give you a brief

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,920
overview so um

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,760
i want to start with an introduction

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,680
about cute design studio

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
i want to explain a bit what cute design

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,559
studio is from a high level

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
and then i will give a demo and she will

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,720
show

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,799
actually showing you how cute design

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
studio can be used in practice

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
and then because that's i think really

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
interesting for this audience

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
i also want to talk about what's behind

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,360
the scenes of cubes design studio

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,960
especially how we use qt

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,640
how uh what is the source code and so on

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
and so on and also what technologies we

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
use

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,720
and in the end there will be a bit of

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,680
time for questions and answers

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,079
so yes what is cute design studio yeah

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,439
it's

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,640
a huge dedicated design tool

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,200
and it can be used to create uis

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,400
but it can also be used to define the ux

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
the behavior of these

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,880
these uis and yes you can work with 2d

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,759
and 3d

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,840
and you can use qml for that so qml is

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,320
the underlying technology

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
so um your design studio always works on

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,119
qml files

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,880
and qml is basically the the

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,200
representation for the

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,479
for the ui so there's no technology

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
switch when you

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,399
hand that over to an application

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,360
developer c plus plus developer so

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
everything is

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,080
always qml based um

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
a bit under the hood because cube design

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,280
studio is based on cute creator

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,599
it's um an adjusted and optimized

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
version just for qml editing and focus

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,560
quick development

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
so we turn off the c plus plus parts

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
basically rebranded a bit

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
i will talk about that later and the

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,480
last version we released is

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,480
awards cue design student 2.1

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
and we release always a commercial

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
license version

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,440
and the free community version i will be

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,440
briefly talk about the differences

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,000
okay so what can i actually do with q

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
design studio

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
um yes you can develop you i designed

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
with a big visibility editor

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
that is what i will mostly show in the

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
demo and that is

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,080
what a lot of people will spend their

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,480
time with but you can also create

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,080
animations based on the timeline i will

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
briefly show that also as part of the

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
demo

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,200
you can define ui logic with states and

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
binding i will also cover that

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
you can create your custom controls i

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
will create a simple button in the demo

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,519
later

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
you can import designs and assets and

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
will not cover that today

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
so for 2d that's photoshop sketch and

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,480
figma

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,400
and that is basically the main feature

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,800
that's just the commercial version

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
and for 3d you can also import for maya

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
blenders

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
and others for 3d assets yes um

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and with this you basically can turn

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
your designs into working qml

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
you can create prototypes or fully

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,519
functional applications even

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,959
what you cannot do is basically the c

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,440
plus bus parts

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
and finally you can deploy and run and

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
profile on target hardware i will not

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
cover that today

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,599
but with q designs you can actually

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
deploy to

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,159
linux hardware and and actually even

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
profile

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,840
okay the latest version latest version

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
is cute design c201

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
i already mentioned that we have the

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
bridges

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
to import designs then we have the

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
visual 2d editor we also have an

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
integrated text editor i will show that

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,480
there's a visual 3d editor for qt quick

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
3d

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
there's a flow editor i will not cover

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
that today there's a

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,239
state transition editor i will briefly

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,120
show that um yeah we support the cute

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,519
quick layouts

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
also we'll show that a bit in the demo

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
um

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,160
all the ready-made and reusable ui

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
components you're used to from cute

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
quick come with your design studio and

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
even a few more

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,680
there are timeline based animations um a

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
couple of business customized visible

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
effects and there's also the live

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
preview which is also very interesting

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,759
feature i will briefly show

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,840
so you can basically live update your

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
application while working on it

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
okay yes um the first release was

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
actually

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,080
cute designed to the one was in december

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
and since then we regularly released new

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,280
versions

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,680
um figma support was one of the the

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,919
items we added in the last two releases

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,560
we did lots of ux improvements

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,560
improved the usability in general and

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
for the upcoming release we work on full

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,880
q6 support

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,080
and also on again many improvements to

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,919
the ux and

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
especially the property editor i will

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,240
briefly talk about that later

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
okay and with that we come for to the

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:39,840
demo

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:39,840
so i will now share my screen

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,600
so what you can see here is a q design

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
studio

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,840
this is a welcome page this is the first

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,360
thing that you will see

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,199
and on the webcam page there are a few

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,319
demos that come with q design studio i

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
will show a few of them

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,919
later but for now let's start with a new

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,919
project from scratch

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,360
and i choose a resolution here

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,720
for this not too fancy it's just a nice

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,080
wizard that

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
sets up a project for you

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,319
and then your design studio starts and

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,240
it has created one screen for you

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,880
with a text in the in the center i

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,720
delete that we don't need that

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
and yeah there's lots of functionality

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
you can do for example you can easily

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
change

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880
the background color here we have like

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,880
in every design tool we have a navigator

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
for now we just have one single root

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,319
element here

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,759
um yeah briefly mentioned the text

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
editor but i will

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,680
show that later so i just drag in a

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
rectangle here

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,080
and then we can anchor it

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,759
so it supports the the anchors that you

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
have in cute quick

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,560
we can change the color we can also

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,240
change the radius

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
and this is basically what you what we

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,520
typically expect the technical artist or

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,440
designer to do

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
to basically use the visual tool to

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
create uh

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
some visual design it could be imported

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
from figma or photoshop

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
but you can also recreate it from

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,919
scratch

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
even imported designs of course you can

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,800
tweak here and now i

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,639
just continue dragging in a label you

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,240
see all the text properties here and i

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,599
change the color

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,599
adjust the font size a bit

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
no surprises here that's just how you

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
use it

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
i will briefly talk about the property

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,960
editor later how we implement

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,599
implemented that one

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
that's implemented in cute quick using

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,199
good quick controls 2

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,639
and our own custom style

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,080
and now i know created a layout around

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,800
the two text items i created and i just

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,440
renamed them so this is basically

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
typical

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,840
day-to-day work and the goal here is

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
that i create a very simple ui

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,199
show a couple of features so the 90 for

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
example i will skip that here would

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
typically

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
be binding to something from the back

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,160
end

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,319
right now we just keep it hard coded

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
and

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,720
yes without touching any qml code i can

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,520
i can create this and i use copy and

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
paste

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
in a few cases

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
and now i'm basically done with the

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,880
basics here

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,279
move that around a bit you can see i

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
have snapping here so things snap to

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,560
each other

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
there's also another nice feature we

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,399
have alignment features similar to

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
similar to what you see in illustrator

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
so my line

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
i distributed them actually but that's

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
not exactly what i want because i want

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
two columns so let's use the

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,480
distribution feature again here

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,040
so i distribute them evenly so don't

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
have to do that by hand or rely

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,720
to just my eyes and i can also you have

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
alignment features that's pretty much

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,839
what you know from illustrator

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,480
that's really nice if you want to do

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
absolute designs of course you have all

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,360
the

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,959
layouts and anchors but sometimes maybe

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,160
you just want to

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,959
uh have one single resolutions and then

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,640
absolute layouts are easier

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,480
okay i put everything into group which

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,000
is a custom item that only comes with q

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,000
design studio

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,680
it's basically just an item that

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
automatically takes the

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
size of its children so nothing special

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,480
here

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,120
and i guess tribute here again and i

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
think

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
yeah now i kind of would be done with

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,160
with this

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,160
um as a ui and anchor it a bit here

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
by centering it

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,880
and yeah

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,480
this was basically typical day-to-day

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,920
work with what you do in design studio

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,760
and but now i want to do something a

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,360
tiny bit more fancy i want to create a

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,000
custom button so i create

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,959
from the wizard a new component and

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,519
choose button

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,959
and by default it has two two states for

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,480
normal and down

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,279
and i can now edit them in the

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,720
visibility editor in the editor mode

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,720
and adjust my button a bit

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,079
so select the background give it some

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,200
radius here

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,200
so it's not a bit round

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
and it's also a nice place to show the

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,680
live preview so now i run the live

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
preview of that button

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
and that's basically interactive preview

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
of the button it's basically like

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,800
running the button

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
but there's a tiny difference that is if

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
i do now

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
change in the in the editor in design

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,720
studio

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,920
it's immediately up propagated into the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,399
application

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,800
so you see that that the the running

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,399
button basically is also updated

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,839
that's really nice in this case so you

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,440
know change also the label color

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,240
and i still have my working button and i

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,560
don't have to constantly restart

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
use a little component like a button or

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,959
anything that's complicated or so if

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,760
they're

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,959
running animations that's that's helpful

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,959
because you can see constantly

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,920
oh wait first i want to show you

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,200
transitions actually

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,440
so this is a transition editor and that

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,079
adds automatically transitions to our

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
states

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,240
and i can now change the duration a bit

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,279
to make them more visible and now

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,320
instead of

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,720
the button like it was before it is

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,200
animated

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
there's one trick because there's no

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,160
animation i have to make the normal

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
state the default state

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,519
but now i see that there's a animation

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,320
when i check the

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,680
press the button and it's a few clicks

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,680
as you can see

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,240
and you can easily tweak those even

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,839
using easing curves and so on

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,839
but now let's really go back

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,839
the form i created on top of those this

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
form i will now use i want to use now my

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
custom button

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
it was added to the item library even

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
has a preview here

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
and i can drag it in and i drag into

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,040
copies

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
of my button my custom button

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
give it a name

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
and position them

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,279
and this is really powerful you can

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,440
create your your

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
custom components in design studio nest

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,480
them actually no

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,079
i lock the layer here this is a picture

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
i had we recently edit

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,880
so i cannot accidentally now change the

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,160
layer anymore and then i use anchors

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,079
to the margin to position my buttons and

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,959
now they have the same distance to

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,839
each side is each side's 32 pixels in

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
both cases

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,360
yeah locking is super useful especially

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,320
in this case because i might otherwise

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,959
accidentally

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
move a label and now i can show you the

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,440
qml code

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,800
so this was the code that was generated

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,120
and yeah you can even

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,959
if you use basically the mode the text

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
mode inside design studio is really

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,040
hooked up with a property editor so it

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,160
can work in in parallel

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,160
you can do a change here

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
now i broke it there's a syntax arrow

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,320
that basically will block the ui until i

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,000
fix it again

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,360
but see now it works again and i can use

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,959
the property editor in parallel

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
and i see the changes

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,320
and one thing is the doc widget

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
framework i will also talk a bit about

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,279
that later

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
because it's a special dog widget

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,680
framework and

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
it's very flexible and you can also like

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
put it

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
next to each other and i will keep it

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,240
like that for now that's also very

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
useful if you want to tweak the qml text

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,360
a lot

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,120
if you want to do some optimizations or

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,399
maybe you are a developer and care about

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,560
details

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,000
you can always see the text and the

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,480
visual editor in parallel

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:49,839
now create two states and give them name

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,800
so also here no surprises

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,800
now i start to

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,560
make the buttons checkable and

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,040
in one state i make my whole ui

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
invisible

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,920
so we have the operate state and the

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,839
maintain state and the maintain state

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,839
the the labels i added are invisible

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,240
okay

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:29,440
this is checked here

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,759
then there's also exclusive which is

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
super useful

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,959
because exclusive will basically

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,959
automatically

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,839
say that only one of these buttons can

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,839
be checked at the time

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,519
before i continue i want to give the

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
buttons proper names because i want to

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,480
refer

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,480
to them and when conditions and then

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,639
it's important that i have a good name

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,720
and here i can now refer to the check

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
boxes to the checkable buttons and i can

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,079
basically define

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
the when conditions of each state

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,639
without having to write code

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,120
just by using the combo boxes which is

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,079
very convenient for people who are not

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,360
let's say not very professional

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,880
developers who are not

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,560
very used to writing code now can also

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
run the live preview again

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,560
and yes you see that we have basically a

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,800
very very very simple

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,160
running application without writing any

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,040
code and of course you can

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,120
continue like that but i also want to

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,759
show you a few more advanced features

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,440
from that way that's why for example

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,079
we'll now open the e-bike demo

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,199
that comes with gear design studio and

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,600
ebay demo

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,240
heavily uses the timeline and i want to

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
show

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,600
how the timeline is used here so we have

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,120
many states in the e-bike demo

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
and there are many transitions between

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,560
those states and we didn't use

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,480
transitions because they you know they

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
don't always allow to fine-tune

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
the animations very well in this case we

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,079
use the timeline

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,639
and basically you find each transition

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,040
is very explicit using keyframes

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
but that gives the designer a lot of

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,360
control

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,520
the transitions don't have to be

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,480
symmetric you can add keyframes in the

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,240
middle

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
you can really make sure that that the

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,760
transition looks exactly like you want

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,839
to at every

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,079
every pixel basically every point of the

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,679
animation

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,199
and for the timeline we also have a

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
curve editor

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,480
it's a very powerful curve editor and

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
here you see that there are also

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,480
easing curves between the keyframes

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,360
that's something that that's

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,919
more common in 3d tools but that's a

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,840
very powerful view on this

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,520
and to give you an idea let's just run

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,080
this

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,640
so yes so basically when i interact here

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,400
i switch the states and the the timeline

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,720
is then used to animate between those

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
states

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,000
these are exactly the same animation

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,400
that you saw when i dragged the

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
timeline handle before

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,400
okay now i will show you the welcome

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,400
page of q design studio so the welcome

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,640
page of q design studio

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,840
is also developed in q design studio

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,640
um and that's a relatively interesting

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
example because it has a c plus back end

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
and we mop

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,400
that up with qml

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
but first i want to show this is

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,559
basically the screen of the welcome page

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,039
the recent projects examples and so on

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,039
and yeah it's done in in design studio

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,080
nothing too fancy here

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,120
um and we could now adjust it change it

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,720
whatever we want to do and uh it

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,559
actually was developed by our designer

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
and it's also maintained by our designer

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,559
you can also run it and something shows

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,520
up here in the recent projects

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,679
because we have this mock backend that's

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,919
a very powerful technique to basically

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,600
mock up the c plus bus back back end

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
with simple qml

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,120
that can be understood even from the

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,919
designer maybe even tweaked by the

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,480
designer

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
in this case it's very very simple you

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,720
look at the text there was just

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,280
list model basically and there are a few

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,280
more of these

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
but that's a very powerful technique

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
because now we have a project that runs

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,640
fully in design studio

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,000
really can be owned basically by the

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
designer

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,360
and can be just integrated and here is

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,360
the trick we have a couple of import

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,720
paths that act at the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,360
mock data as sqml plugins and those

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
mock plugins of course are not part of

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,039
the c plus plus part

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,880
and on the c plus plus supply side it's

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:37,520
just loaded by the cute creator plugin

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,200
makes it possible to develop it in

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
design studio in parallel to having it

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,960
in the c

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
plus application

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,520
now i want to show you the digital

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,640
cluster that's a downloadable demo

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,160
i downloaded it before so let's just

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,320
open this that's a demo that shows a lot

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,520
of the 3d capabilities

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,520
so cute quick 3d

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:09,360
and i'll start with the main screen here

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,919
yeah you can see it so that's a cluster

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,159
and that uses quite a lot of q quick 3d

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,520
so to give you an impression i just run

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,919
it

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,360
it has a light and dark theme it was

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,080
actually developed by a

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,159
technical artist purely in design studio

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,960
it has no c plus plus backend

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,440
but you can do a lot of stuff just using

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
qml

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,840
so you can turn on the lights open the

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
doors rotate it

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,039
you can see that you can even have 3d in

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,240
2d and then 2d

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,200
3d again is interior view

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,200
is a battery view with a nice animation

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
and there's a desk view

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,320
and that was all developed in q design

00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,960
studio and i want to show you a few of

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,960
the files so that's the adas view

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,640
and the ads view doesn't have a back end

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
and it's it's really just basically

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
mocked and

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
the timeline was used for that but

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,240
that's actually

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,679
powerful technique while you're in the

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
prototype stage

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,840
because you can always mock it and you

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,679
don't have to worry about the

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,039
implementation at this stage but you can

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,039
already define how it will look

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,159
and yeah we have another screen that has

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,080
different states

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,760
you saw on the ui and those stakes were

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,760
all defined by the technical artist

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,840
and yeah that's a battery animation you

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
saw earlier

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,480
and you can create such a demo with

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
either writing no code or just very

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
limited amount of code yourself i mean

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,559
of course you can always go to the qml

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,159
code

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,840
that's your choice right and

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
yeah for example here's a component

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
right one one thing that makes q also

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,480
powerful is that

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,400
you can have all these different

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,880
reusable components

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
and there's some some structure that the

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,880
technical artist was

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,640
setting in place and you can always look

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
at the text editor

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,919
yeah with that i want to stop with the

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
demo

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,559
and get back

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,080
so okay

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,840
yeah now i want to talk a bit about

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
what's behind the scenes of cube design

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,320
studio so

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,960
hopefully you now have an impression

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,960
what it can do and what it's meant for

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,240
um but i also want to give you an

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,120
impression how we

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
developed it how we use qt because we

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
are

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,960
basically yeah especially on the

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,000
front-end side we use basically we have

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,400
a user of the

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
cute and q quick technologies so cute

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,640
design skills a pretty typical

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,159
acute quick and cute uh cross-platform

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
desktop application so it's a pure

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
desktop application

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,799
you're currently in the process of

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,760
porting your compute you have a working

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,640
version and

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,159
just ironing out the bugs your design

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,080
studio is that's no surprise

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,159
available for windows mac os and linux

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,280
so and i briefly want to talk about our

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
main challenges

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,799
in a sense uh when it comes to the cute

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,039
stack and that's

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,480
with graphics driver on windows you

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,200
sometimes have problems with those

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
because

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
yes we use qt quick and even q quick 3d

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,120
and there can be issues because of

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,120
graphics drivers

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,799
and those can be quite nasty because

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,159
it's not on our control and

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
we might not even have a machine to

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
reproduce those

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,520
another thing that's a bit challenging

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
is sometimes that linux is a very

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,520
heterogeneous environment

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
so that's why we officially only support

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,120
ubuntu

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:52,159
uh 2004 the latest fps version

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,799
i mean we test it on more linux machines

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,320
but

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,840
we don't commit to two more

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,799
installations

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,320
it's just um yeah they're especially the

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,679
different window managers are sometimes

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,760
a challenge

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,520
and but also the drivers and so on but

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,799
all in all it works quite well on linux

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,360
and actually we have

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,960
surprisingly many many linux where users

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,200
even in commercial environment

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,880
especially people who like to or who

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
develop in embedded linux or for

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,720
embedded linux

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,480
they like to have uh all their tools on

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
linux and don't want to switch for

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,360
to windows or mac os just for design

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
studio

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,679
okay so uh what is q design studio

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
technically

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,120
it's the customized version of cute

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,480
crater it's no

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,159
fork so um it's usually always based on

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,720
the latest version of cute crater

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,640
that's how we always did it until now we

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,159
don't plan to change that

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,440
um yeah we brand it a bit which means um

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,240
we we renamed the executable and and

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
exchanged the the icons and so on but

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,159
that's

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,720
basically these few switches on the

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,240
build system and also upstream you can

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,640
even see how we do that

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240
so there's really no black magic on that

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,120
the packaging is done a bit

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
different because for example um we

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,360
switch

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,760
we ship our own version so that makes

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
our

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,360
product easier because we basically know

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,720
that cute design studio is always based

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,120
on the same version of cute

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,240
through the one we each we ship it with

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,679
which was currently

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,279
cute 15.3 and because that was one of

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,720
the biggest problems with oil

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,799
is with a cute quick design and cute

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,880
crater that we don't know which

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,559
exact cute version it's used with and

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
that creates a

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,720
basically combinatorical explosion of

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,919
potential issues and it's basically

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,080
impossible for us

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,840
to provide a constant quality and this

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,679
becomes a lot easier in this case

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,080
we test our packages and if they work

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,080
they work and

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,279
we can really provide a relatively high

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,039
quality

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,320
another thing that's special about q

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,679
design studio that

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,039
it comes with a couple of custom

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,640
components that come from a

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,200
these are special repository components

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,840
actually quite a lot of them by now

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,559
for the flow editor and things like like

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,679
arcs

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:09,200
that are based on the qml shapes and

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,679
a few msu specific things and

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,279
quite a lot of uh components in the end

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,400
that basically just ship with cute quick

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,400
designer

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,320
um but those components they are also

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,520
open source and they are living in that

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,279
repository and eventually we also make a

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,120
plan to make them part of cute

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
once but we don't want to make that too

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,360
early because we don't want to commit

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,640
basically to the final api and the final

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,440
um implementation too early

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
some parts are closed source so okay

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,080
that's a bit unfortunate

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,520
but um that's how it is so

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,039
actually there's a plugin that we add to

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,440
cute creator that contains the

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,159
closed source parts so that's just a

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,520
plugin

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,720
that's just part of qds

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,360
it's called cute quick designer and

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,240
and yeah the biggest part of this uh

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,760
close the biggest

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,600
closed source parts are the cute bridges

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,760
importer there also a few other things

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,080
but they are often just closed source

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,679
because um we didn't meet the feature

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,960
fees for create crater for example and

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,760
then we move them over

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,200
in the next release this was the case

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,440
for the timeline for example that we

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,480
eventually moved over to create crater

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,640
and we just recently moved over the

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,679
the event which is another feature i

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,840
didn't show here

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,360
that is basically part of q design

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,039
studio that was closed source

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,880
that that build and eventually moved

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:38,000
over to cute creator

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,159
yeah one thing that that i really really

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,720
like is the cute advanced docking system

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,120
i didn't show it in depth in the demo

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,000
but it's not a normal um cue talking

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,919
system but it's

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,159
a different implementation it's based on

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,320
what on the cue talking system but

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,080
it adds a lot of features it was

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,200
contributed to cute and cute creator by

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,200
number quinto who's

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,399
the original author it's licensed on the

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,440
lgpl v2 and yeah you can get it from our

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,600
marketplace

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
and also from github that's basically

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,360
your original

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,919
that's developed by you uber kindler um

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,799
you also

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,720
maintain currently a fork in part that's

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,919
part of cute crater

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,520
and yes why do we use it

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,799
so because it has a couple of really

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,039
really nice advantages and features

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,039
i think what was the most important

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,919
feature was that it has no center of

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,000
widget

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,080
so it's more flexible so it has no

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,760
concept of a central widget

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,159
and you already saw that when i when i

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,600
split it the formatted and text editor

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,679
view that this really

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,919
is a very nice and powerful features in

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,000
the context of q design studio

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,440
because yeah it makes the workspace a

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
lot more flexible

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,360
another feature i really like is the

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,360
clear visualization of the

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,799
drop targets you can see that here in

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,120
the screenshot

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,480
it's very similar to what other tools

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,919
like visual studio do

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
it's people understand that it's

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,279
relatively intuitive

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
there are more features especially when

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,000
it comes to stacking and talking

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,960
and also comes with perspectives so you

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,799
can

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,399
switch layouts easily and so on

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,799
perspectives can be built

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
of course also on top of the cute-based

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,600
one but

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,440
you get it basically for free yeah and

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
that's what we use in cue design studio

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,320
and

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
i think it's really a great addition a

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,520
nice contribution

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,799
and feel free to to test it out if you

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,240
need a powerful dog widget framework

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,960
um yes so we are also a heavy user of

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,880
qt quick for desktop applications and

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,360
that's why i also want to talk a bit

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,840
about

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,600
how we use qt quick what is our

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,120
experience what we like what we don't

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,039
like and so on

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,640
so in short we use it for the welcome

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,720
screen and especially

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,679
those are relatively simple parts the

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
welcome screen are

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,200
already covered the implementation is

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
kind of really simple i think it's a

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,600
really nice

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,039
and great uh test case and also use case

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,720
for cute quick in general

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,159
it's nothing complicated you can really

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,159
hand it over to

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
to technical artist or designer he can

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,919
basically own the

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,000
the whole welcome page with a little bit

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,320
of help from a developer here and there

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,480
and that's really nice workflow and they

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,640
can build it in the way they want it

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
and we just integrate it into the c plus

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
application

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,840
the propagated is a bit more complicated

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,520
i will talk about that

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,120
in a few seconds um

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,880
and then we also have the item library

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,919
which is also a bit more complicated so

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,760
both of them are

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,760
basically maintained by developers not

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,000
by design anymore because

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,960
yeah they contain quite a lot of code

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,480
and they are mostly fully dynamic

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,159
and then they're also the states editor

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,559
who's similar

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,679
but even there the the designer can help

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,320
because we can give him

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,919
strip down projects that are pure qml he

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,000
can basically define the look

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,120
adjust it you can also give access to

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,159
him and he can

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,919
tweak around with the with the designs

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,919
directly and we did that actually

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,480
so yeah the welcome splash screen

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,159
there's really nothing

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,399
i didn't mention already kind of it's

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,240
really pure qml it has a very very

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,679
simple c plus back and that's very

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,760
easily mocked

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,519
and it basically works as a standalone

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,480
application in q design student i also

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,880
test that

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,799
test case for our workflow

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,919
yes the property editor is actually

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,480
quite a beast so it's really complicated

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,559
the property editor uses customized qt

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,880
quick controls too

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,159
and yeah we are quite happy with the

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,159
with the result

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
so there are a couple of features that

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,840
that you don't have

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,679
typically for you example you don't have

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,360
and with widgets and so on

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,000
so for example you can drag on the spin

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,240
boxes also um

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
we don't show most of the controls by

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,519
default

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,120
so most of the sub controls you only get

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,080
when you hover on the

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,840
on the controls that reduces a lot of uh

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,159
clutter and it's actually quite typical

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,640
for modern applications

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,919
and all of this would be possible but

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,039
very hard to implement

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,960
uh with widgets and we did that we think

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,120
we did we decided not to do this

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,159
so we used uh quick controls 2 and qt

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,000
quick

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,679
we're really happy with the results

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
another thing that's worth mentioning is

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,559
that the studio controls are fully

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,440
resizable

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,880
so um every number basically comes from

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,760
a small theme

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,120
and all the magic numbers are usually

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,679
based on

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,159
or use one scale factor and by tweaking

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,240
that

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,840
scale factor they are fully resizable we

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,720
don't expose that to the end user at

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,399
this point in time

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,080
but makes our life a lot easier um

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,760
yeah because basically all the numbers

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,440
all these magical numbers that can be

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,600
controlled by the designer

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,640
and therefore he can really own this

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,840
um yeah we also hook this up to the

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,600
to the seaming theme of cute creator

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,080
so the colors actually come from the

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,760
theming scheme of theme of cute creator

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,159
so that why do they it works in all

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,559
themes which is also nice

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,919
and yeah the studio controls are part of

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,600
cute creator so

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,120
they have a huge license and you can

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,960
look at them i think

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,720
might be really interesting if you build

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,360
something similar to have a look at them

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,600
and

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,039
maybe even use them okay

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,799
yeah let's briefly talk about the

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,200
advantages of using

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,559
quick in the front end so it's really

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,919
easy to customize

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,320
the look and feel i think it's really a

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,960
lot easier than doing that with widgets

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,320
and also some experience on that side

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,960
and it's also a lot easier

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,279
easier to implement modern and advanced

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,200
ux

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,880
um yeah you can use q design skill for

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
the front end that's also of course nice

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,159
especially from our perspective

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,159
the designer can take full

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,720
responsibility of simpler parts like the

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,480
welcome page or at least help out

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,760
more complicated parts to the property

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
editor on the property editor there are

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
always things that

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,799
developer has to help out but you can

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,039
always help with the layouts

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,039
um basically maintain the colors and

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,360
magic numbers and so on

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,200
one thing that that really helps a lot

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,640
is hot reloading

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,440
so all our views uh support hot

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,159
reloading

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,440
so by pressing hotkey um it will reload

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,919
the qml code

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,919
and that allows very very fast feedback

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,560
cycles and that's just great

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,079
and you get used to that very fast so we

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,159
press one button and then

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
you can test the different behavior or

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,839
different size or

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,040
one buck is simply fixed no recompile

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,720
nothing

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,480
another very powerful feature is that

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,879
the property editor for example can be

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,879
extended with external qml files

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,000
that come or are shipped with qml

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,599
modules

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,839
so yeah it makes the property editor

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,639
very extensive extendable from the

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,720
outside

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,919
without having to write c plus plugins

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,520
or anything like that

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,440
you can just basically write a qml file

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,800
that extends the property editor for

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,399
specific file

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,240
type okay what are the challenges

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,320
the other bindings between c plus plus

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,680
and q ml they require a bit of overhead

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
and boilerplate code

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,680
i don't think that's a show show stop or

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,920
anything but

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,240
yeah it's a bit of extra work what is

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,839
more serious is that

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,359
the developers who do this work they

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,960
have to be experienced in both c plus

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,079
plus and humanity quick

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,599
this can be a bit of a bottleneck um and

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,760
in some cases cute quick is not as

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,119
mature as cuba just for desktop

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,800
development especially if you think of

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,280
three views and so that's still not the

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,640
case

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,119
i mean we're really heavily working on

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,320
that but yeah there are still things you

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,520
might have to

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,400
work around or experiment a bit

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,320
and yeah there's also the dependency on

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,079
3d acceleration which sometimes can be a

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,040
problem because of drivers

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,160
and generally because of to basically

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,680
having two languages

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
there can be high complexity and you

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,240
have to be aware of that and be careful

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,040
so basically all the logic we put purely

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,880
in c plus

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,720
so roughly our rule could be something

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,480
like no loops in qml

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,320
so if everything anything is slightly

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,640
more complicated it becomes c

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,320
plus plus and really just the simple

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,320
parts are qml and javascript

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,200
another thing um we added is google

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,640
crashpad

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,400
um yeah that collects stack traces

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,320
there's no technology of us it's part of

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,760
chromium but i think it's worth

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,760
mentioning here

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,680
um it's opt-in because it can contain

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,240
con confidential data

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,240
we use sentry as a back-end service and

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,240
you can also look how it works in in our

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,800
source code and part of creator might be

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,119
worth

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,960
looking into it if you need it if you

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,160
want to collect crash pads

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,599
crash dumps on desktop platforms and

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
another thing we added recently was

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,440
telemetry

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,040
that's based on pay user feedback and

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
it's also opt-in of course and we

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,160
collect

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,960
lots of data usage behavior usage

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,960
pattern

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,280
but we also added a dialogue that

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,599
explicitly asks users to rate

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
features and so on that's pretty typical

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,520
for modern applications

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,720
and okay user feedbacks make it really

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,440
simple to implement

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,040
there's already create a plug-in that

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,599
helps us with that and we just sit on

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,000
top of this

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,599
yeah if i want to try out cute design

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
studio you have two options you can

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,359
download

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,880
it using the cute online installer or

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,079
the latest or you can always get the

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,079
releases uh also from our download page

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,520
so that's a standalone installer for the

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,920
but the standard logo

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,800
always only works for the free community

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,520
version

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
whereby when you have a license and you

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,160
have a commercial license then you have

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,160
to use the cute online installer

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,880
but yeah please give it a chance try out

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,400
with that i say thank you i hope you

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,200
learned a bit and got an

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,839
overview about what q design studio is

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,040
what it can be used for and also like

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,720
how we use qt and maybe something that

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,160
that you can use for your own

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,200
qda application in the future thank you

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,920
and have a nice evening thank you thomas

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,240
so um i don't see any question right now

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,480
the

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,640
there is some feedback cheat shot on the

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,839
chat there are people who are

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,440
wondering how to uh find some customers

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,119
who can pay them to

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,119
use this tool so that's kind of probably

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,720
you always try with the free version so

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,920
we don't need to

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,839
right the the basic it's uh you only

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,440
have to absolutely have to pay if you

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,240
have one to use the purchase which are

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,960
interesting

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,000
but then again you already use products

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,240
anyway

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,760
yeah but i guess they just want to be

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,359
able to spend time there

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,880
so being paid for that it's a good

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,720
excuse

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
even with the regardless of the version

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,720
used

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,599
okay i still don't see

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,599
any question

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,599
so i guess

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,200
um we can go for uh again a virtual

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,280
round of applause for thomas

00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:01,839
thanks again you have all the contacts

00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,839
