	By Thomas Hartmann
QML, a user interface markup language, is part of the Qt framework. QML is a declarative language (like CSS and JSON). Qt Quick is the name of the QML based framework for defining modern user interfaces.
To break the cycle of painstaking feedback loops between designers and developers the Qt Company is also developing Qt Design Studio a graphical editor for Qt Quick and QML. Qt Design Studio comes also as a free community version for non-commercial users and is available for Linux.
This talk is showing how Qt Design Studio with Qt and QtQuick can be used to create applications with a modern user interface and how to involve UX designers in the development process.
The free community version is freely available for non-commercial users and can be utilized to improve and speed up the development of Qt/QML Open Source applications.
