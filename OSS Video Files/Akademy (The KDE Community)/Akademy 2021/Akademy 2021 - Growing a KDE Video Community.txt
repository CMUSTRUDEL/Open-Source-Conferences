Description: 
	By NiccolÃ² Venerandi
At the beginning of 2021 I started up an experiment to create a video community around KDE, specifically using Youtube. I will cover how that went, the benefits for KDE, and you can do the same. Let's grow this community :)

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,080
hi everyone

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,400
and let's talk about is about creating a

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,680
kde video community

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,640
and you might ask of course

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,600
what video community did you create to

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
talk about this

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,640
so well i created a youtube channel

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
which is this one at the link that

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,360
you're seeing

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,239
of course uh go past paste it

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,800
in the browser subscribe watch all of my

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,840
videos

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,640
likes share and stuff like that it's

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
the bare minimum at this point and i

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,079
think it really worked well

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
so i wanted to share my experience with

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,399
you

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
first of all the why i did it so i

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
thought

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,160
that youtube was helping um

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
was the best way to create a larger

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,640
audience because

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,960
i've seen so that some people's uh

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,159
are a bit lazy let's say because they're

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
doing other things

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,320
during their day and so they're not

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,880
having kd as their

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,680
main form of interest so if you do like

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
a blog post they might not want to read

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,159
through all of it

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,479
whereas youtube gets makes you

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
produce a lighter content that they

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,159
might enjoy

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
through the day and it's easier for them

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
to watch

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
through all of it furthermore a blog

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
post you can

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
you can't actually follow you should set

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,079
up our access and stuff

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
whereas youtube just you pop up the

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,400
website and youtube's

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
uh suggests your videos to more users so

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,360
you can get it

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,119
to a wider audience very easily

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,520
then uh why i choose youtube

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,640
and the main reason is that that's what

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,920
people use and

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,119
yes it's non open source and stuff kd

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,000
official account of course

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,640
tries to use peer 2 when it's possible

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
but

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
you as a person if you want to reach a

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
larger

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,759
audience youtube is the way to go

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,800
because it's the most popular

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,160
platform regarding this also it has

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,239
lots and lots of useful useful

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,360
tools to help you analyze how your

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,200
channel is growing

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
what works and what doesn't

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
so regarding the filmmaking it's not

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
really important

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,959
but i use audacity for audio and simple

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,040
screen recorder obviously is good too

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,879
and it's very important to get a decent

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,599
microphone like i've talked to some

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,640
youtubers

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,040
and they say audio is the single one

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,040
most important thing about videos

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,720
forget about video quality and not

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,239
forget but it's not very important

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,200
compared to audio

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
and then try to edit out burning moments

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
do a bit

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
uh editing zooming in on the important

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
stuff

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,519
music background music stuff like that

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,480
just to make the content lighter

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
and easier for the user to watch through

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,959
it

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
they want by the way you have statistics

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,959
and you can see that users

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,760
don't watch your content entirely but

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,720
still

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,080
the longer they do the better and it's

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,599
also good to have both

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,040
like your face in a corner and then

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,720
the whole rest of it in the background

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,800
so next is how i

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,720
create actually create the community and

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
step one is

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,920
sorry i thought i had deleted this slide

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
so let's

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,000
um yeah sorry step one is to

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,959
talk about specific topic of interest as

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,440
an example kde theming his hour started

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,720
and use forums regarding those interests

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
to share your videos

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239
lacroix did at the beginning it's very

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,760
important to have

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,720
an external views so views coming from

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,319
links posted somewhere but after some

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,720
months youtube will start

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,840
recommending your video so it's not as

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,599
important but

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,360
if you want to start you need to have

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
some kind of community

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
that already exists where to post your

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,879
link into

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,760
then the step two is to talk about stuff

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,879
in your niche

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,680
that are of general interest as a as an

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
example

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,079
videos about new kde releases are very

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
popular because lots of people

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,000
are interested in them they go to

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,759
youtube they google

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,280
plasma 5.22 and your video will pop up

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,840
because that's what um that covers

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
the need of the user of knowing what's

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,600
going on with the new release

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,600
and third try to communicate to other

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,759
niches like the gnome one so i try to do

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
some videos where i try out other

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,040
desktop environments and that

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,240
revealed itself to be pretty pretty

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,639
it works well so for the ignom one i got

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
lots of people coming actually from

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,560
gnome

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
so now my channel is not just kde plasma

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
people but also some

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
people coming from gnome so you're able

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
to create

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,759
a wider audience even though you still

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,479
do mostly kitty

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,199
theme content

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,560
and regarding topics of course you

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,680
decide

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
i did a bit of brainstorming and stuff

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
that i

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
came up with are how to set up developer

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,479
environments

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
how to contribute how to build

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,639
applications

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,600
like with cmake and make stuff

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,080
how to write a theme and so on these

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
other

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,680
are things that i mean are almost

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,360
obvious

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,520
to us developers you just go like create

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,720
your kd folder and then go with

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,600
kder kde source build and it does

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,919
everything for us at this point but

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
i remember when i first started kde and

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,199
it was not obvious at all

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
and my builds kept falling and i was not

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
able to understand

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
why because i was missing packages and

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
stuff like that

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,919
so good videos that show you step by

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,160
step how do you

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
how to build your first dolphin

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
application

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,919
those are really useful and if you're

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,440
able to compile it's really easier for

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,919
you to contribute

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,680
as a user wanting to join kde

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,520
then there's also actual one hour long

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,280
two hour long coding sessions

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,280
and i was surprised because people do

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,199
actually watch those i thought

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
nobody was going to because what's the

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
point but people

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
are interesting and they seem to learn

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,840
also something while doing it

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,800
and that's very nice and also it's very

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
cool to show

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
what work you're doing what you're

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,440
working on because

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,759
user you first of all you will get some

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
first hand kind of feedback of course

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,160
you will have the

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
damp kind of feedback where they point

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,800
out something

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
super obvious that you already know

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
about in like

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
20 comments and you get annoyed by it

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
but just realize that

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,240
uh what you're doing is not the main

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,800
concern of the user so of the

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,160
often they say something without really

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,479
thinking about it just

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,440
don't worry about those kind of comments

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
but

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
there are like a couple at least in

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,759
every videos that are actually

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,960
useful for what you're doing so that

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,080
might help you

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,960
develop your product and yeah

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,240
also to keep them updated to keep them

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,120
excited

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:34,720
and stuff like that and then

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,599
this was like the plan and does it work

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
i think so like i was very happy with

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,919
how i did

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,120
you can see that the green line

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,520
are new subscribers and the purple one

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,680
are

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,280
views and since i've started in like

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,960
um january it has been

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,479
always going up these are partial data

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,319
from this month of course

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,080
also i haven't published anything

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,759
because of exams but

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,199
i always had like a good

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,560
momentum forward and never felt like

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,280
it's not working always a video after

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
video i was building up and it was

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,000
nicely working

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,319
out so i liked it and for another graph

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,879
these are the subscribers

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
and i was actually surprised like my

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,520
original plan

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,479
was to get to 100 subscribers

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,760
and i think i did that within a couple

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,399
of weeks

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159
and that was really impressive and the

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,800
start as you can see was very step

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,919
and then it just kept going at a good

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,440
piece and after

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,720
three months i got to 1000 and

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,120
now after one month i'm

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,839
one thousand and a half so that's really

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,680
good

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,800
and it keeps growing every day except

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,680
when you do videos about about lgbt and

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,200
pride when

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,880
it goes down but

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,040
that's what you get and

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,040
what about money because a side goal of

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,320
it would be trying to

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,160
partially uh like fund

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,839
your uh even your investment with kde

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,399
your work through uh either the

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,519
donations or

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,440
the youtube monetization thing and

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:33,120
as far as a donation goes

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,560
they won't be like a paycheck

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
but for a student they're decent forget

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,040
about

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,560
june because it's like a one-off

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,440
it will go down uh next month but

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,720
in average i think i did something like

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,720
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,600
50 to 60 hour monthly

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
and what i found found out is that i

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
hate

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,640
people and libra chat because they

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,800
offer no reliable way to know whether

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,880
you're getting the money next month as

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
well whether as

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,160
if you look at like patreon you can see

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,839
that it's

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,399
uh slowly but constantly going up

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,959
libra just has one month where people

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,399
used it

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
and paypal is a crazy because

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
next month is going to be pretty much

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,880
nothing stuff like that

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,040
so patreon is the best way forward and

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,120
i'm finishing my time there's also

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
youtube monetization i think i'll do

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,959
something like 50

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
to 60 or monthly it's hard to reach but

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,680
after

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,519
four months you can do it right now i

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,120
have 0.66

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,440
years so i'm rich and that's it

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,240
