Traditional 2D rendering methods make use of the CPU. However, modern systems feature an increasingly powerful GPU. Unfortunately the traditional methods are not very suitable for running on the GPU. This means we need to reconsider how to render 2D elements. In this talk I will talk about one technique called Signed Distance Fields, which is used by the KQuickCharts framework as well as the ShadowedRectangle in Kirigami. Signed Distance Fields require some changes in how we deal with 2D elements, but once we have overcome those, they become a very powerful tool for advanced 2D rendering.
