	By  Timoth√©e Ravier
Fedora Kinoite is an immutable desktop operating system featuring the KDE Plasma desktop. It is based on rpm-ostree, Flatpak and podman to create a great user experience with atomic and safe updates for the system (rpm-ostree), the applications (Flatpak) and development tools or containers (podman). Fedora Kinoite is entirely built from Fedora RPM packages which tend to be very close to what upstream KDE is providing.
This talk will explain the goals and advantages with Fedora Kinoite and what is coming next to help KDE developers develop and test upcoming desktop changes more easily.
