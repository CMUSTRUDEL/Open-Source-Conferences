00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,680
now he's here he's here

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,760
okay since we've got everyone uh

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,680
we'll give the audience a couple of

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,519
minutes to type in their questions for

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,320
the champions or the goal initiative as

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,880
a whole

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
in the meantime i do have some questions

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,840
prepared

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
because this is my talk and rules don't

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,640
apply to me and i can do whatever i want

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
so my first question and that that will

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
be to to everyone so jump in as

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,280
you wish is well

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,520
we should be announcing new goals by now

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
but due to the pandemic we decided to

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,920
extend the

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,000
current round for for uh for an uh

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
for a longer period what are your

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,039
opinions about

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,079
this move

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,079
would like to go first

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,040
well my impression if you wish is that

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,320
while it does make sense to keep

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
refreshing them

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,600
like they're all topics that could last

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,960
forever

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,040
virtually um even the

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
first round of goals like we could still

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,880
be doing them and

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,799
it's things that are never over uh at

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,240
least most of them

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,920
um it's useful

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,479
to have continued i don't think that it

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
would have the world would have ended if

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,960
we had stopped

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
but it's good we're here it's all nice

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
and

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
happy right so

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,159
of course anyone else

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
well goals are also great to introduce

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,799
new

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,079
community members or highlight their

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,840
work or their focus

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,920
so it's it's nice to have renewable

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,119
new people basically so that the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,840
community just can maintain and grow

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,410
so that's one of the aspects of the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,490
course

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,490
[Music]

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,160
yeah and also from an organizational

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
perspective

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
um the past one and a half years has

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,080
been

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,480
pretty weird and tough on people um

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,200
and since we really need to take care of

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,239
our people taking out some of the

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,440
pressure of oh my god they have to race

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
to the finish line

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,840
um i think was pretty useful

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,400
yeah for me the thing is i would like to

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,840
do at least

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,680
one in-person sprint for consistency

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,720
if we don't get to do it well we try but

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,519
since there's time now i think that's a

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,120
goal that

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,120
should you sh we should have

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
okay thank you all very much for the

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,560
answer um

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,560
i have a second question prepared

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,840
imagine that you can clone yourself and

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
additionally work for a completely

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
different goal

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
what would it be

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,440
touch screen what was it

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,319
touch screen support ah that's good okay

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,319
that would be my

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,440
it was actually in the proposed course

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
and i think i

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,760
voted it just after consistency and

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
luckily it didn't get picked

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,280
incidentally i already cloned myself and

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,120
i've been working on the whalen goal

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:55,040
during my professional time

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,120
so yay i do agree though

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,159
that there's other stuff that could be

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,000
interesting

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,599
like for example in the hardware

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
integration front

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,000
making uh something that was part of the

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,159
goals that wasn't picked up

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,680
last time was plasma mobile in itself

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,239
which we've seen

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
growing more and more something along

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,080
those lines i think that would

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,199
definitely

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,079
be an interesting topic to have

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,120
for the next round of goals for sure and

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
something we could start

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
working on right now as well or we are

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
already right

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,600
and myself i'm joining the consistency

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,680
or all about the apps or i'm quite

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,160
interested in apps as well in

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:43,360
in framework so i would be

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
well i would jump in in in i could jump

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,120
in

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,120
in any goal almost

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,280
okay lydia you're not working on a call

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,840
just a specific goal but uh if you could

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,440
clone yourself and use the additional

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,960
work hours

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,520
what would it be um someone

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,280
was asking alice earlier today about

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,080
making it easier to work on our apps for

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,080
developers and that sounded pretty cool

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
even though not part of the current

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
upscale

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,320
but could be one of the next ones and if

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,080
you

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,000
want to talk about the next ones you

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,720
should totally come to the buff where we

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,720
discuss those

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
yes perfect advertising for the both

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,720
later this week we'll be talking about

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,680
the process of selecting the new goals

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,320
correct i see one question already

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,960
being submitted so this is about the

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
wayland

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,000
and all about the upscales any interest

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,160
views on supporting wsl2 which is the

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
windows subsystem for linux

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:07,840
especially now that microsoft is working

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:07,840
on wayland integration

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,840
um having support for

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,759
native running our applications natively

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,800
on windows it sounds like it would be

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,600
weird to go through their uh linux layer

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
it might just as well be that their

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
abstraction

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
of linux is better than kids

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,240
obstructions of windows so

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
maybe it's just a technical decision

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
rather than

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,720
a social or business decision

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,479
kind of thing uh in practice i think

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,160
that it's a matter of whatever

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,360
is easiest for the users to

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
use if you have to and i personally i am

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
super ignorant on the topic i haven't

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,680
touched windows in years

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,080
so to speak but if for a

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,400
user it's easier to adopt our own one of

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,759
our applications by

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
by using linux maybe that should be the

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,800
case

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
but i cannot doubt that this will be the

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,520
case so

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,080
i don't know in any case jade above

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,080
hashtag

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,840
even do you want to add anything

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,479
yeah well i just said it well like

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,599
like for our apps are already uh most of

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,080
our apps are already

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
cross-platform so at least uh to some

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
sense

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,160
to some degree so rather than trying to

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,639
put uh two

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,400
so this way is just as easy and maybe

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
more direct

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
and efficient in the end

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,039
[Music]

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,479
okay um we have a next question coming

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,199
from david

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,639
and this is for every uh gold champion

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
how much did being

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,120
an elected goal drive the progress

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
forward

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,680
maybe let's start with nicola yeah it

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
surely helped

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
to a certain extent to a certain extent

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
because

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,919
uh the idea of consistency and revamping

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
the look of plasma was already in the

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,080
air pretty much

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,879
even before the goal was selected but

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,479
giving it an actual infrastructure with

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,599
chats and goal

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,000
like sub goals written down it surely

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,319
helped

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
much

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,839
okay my friend maybe you next yeah well

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,320
at the personal level it allowed me to

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
jump into the subject more heavily

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
because i wasn't

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,600
a queen contributor before and thanks to

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,640
the goal uh

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
i was right in it i had really strong

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
motivation to

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:57,680
jump in and and the

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,839
the the drive while the exposure was was

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
really beneficial and we had a virtual

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,920
sprint was

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,200
that was very successful as well i hope

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,880
we raised interest in the users as well

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,360
through blog posts and and such so

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,800
uh i'm not too sure but

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,080
it definitely helped gather

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,880
developer interest as well so we had a

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
lot more i think here and there a lot of

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,600
more

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
developers testing and then improving

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
their apps or

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,399
are scratching their own each on on the

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
wellness session

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,519
and and and that's one of the benef

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,720
fish fish benefit of the goal

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
double uncle for sure

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,640
okay and alesh you have a fresh

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,480
perspective as a

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
new gold champion here what do you think

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,120
i don't think my feedback is very useful

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,880
here i just started

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
and i don't know not a lot has happened

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,240
yet

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,240
with me in this position so

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,440
i'm gonna pass on that one of course

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,279
understandable uh i have a question from

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,959
johann

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,760
if you could spend the kdev money

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:33,040
what would you spend it on for your goal

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:37,200
or for other goals i'm gonna go ahead

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,560
and change hats and where suddenly my

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,000
kdv president had and say

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,399
we already tried to give some money to

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,160
the goals to spend some

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,720
and they didn't so

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
i guess that the only true question is

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
that

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
spending money is dedicated a very

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,519
delicate topic

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,920
and something that people doing goals

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,640
are

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,600
and generally comfortable with doing

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
so if somebody wants to spend kdp money

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
what they should be doing is getting

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,399
involved with the key tv

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,079
directly rather than going through the

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
goals because this hasn't worked in the

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,399
past

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
yeah i remember when it was proposed and

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
i thought about

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,000
it for like some weeks i asked around

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
but i could not

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
figure figure out anything practically

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,959
useful

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,959
to spend the money

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,759
[Music]

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
well i mean there's always things that

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,600
could be done

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
right but

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,560
it's also very easy to feel like

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
you're wasting the money as community

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,279
members what we're

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,920
used is to coordinate with people rather

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
than

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,880
with resources so let's just focus to

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
what we do best and we know

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,760
how to do right

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,519
anyone you wanted to say something as

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,279
well well i can't i can't wait to

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,880
have the restoration the travel

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,440
restoration lifted because

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,240
that's what's the most efficient way to

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,680
spend well

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,040
the money for goals is to allow

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,000
participants to meet

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,519
and it's just a very important part of

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,200
the kde

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,920
mission as well so well because

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,959
the question you schooled so it's not

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,000
further it's just that

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,120
it's not normal this year so i

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
can't wait to my next goals what have

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,639
these

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
issues i hope

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,160
of course lydia what do you think yeah i

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,079
wanted to add

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,839
um the gold champions are there to among

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
other fans have ideas how to spend this

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
money

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,279
but they're definitely not the only ones

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
just like they're not the only ones

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,680
working on the goals so

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,680
if anyone has meaningful ideas um

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,920
that would contribute to those goals and

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,160
where the plucker is money and not

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,839
people's interest or time or stuff like

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
that please get in touch with the gold

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,160
champions and

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:23,279
suggest that um

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,240
so just to reiterate anyone who is

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,279
interesting

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
in moving a goal forward doesn't have to

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,839
be that gold champion

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,720
can propose a way to spend some eevee

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,959
money to

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,920
to do some cool stuff with the with the

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,160
goal is that correct

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,839
that is correct i mean we obviously have

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
to look at the specific ideas if they

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
make sense for the

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,360
gold champions and are something we can

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
pay for as a non-profit and so on but in

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
general yes

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,000
uh absolutely please do come up with

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,000
ideas and talk to people

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,160
okay so uh the kind of things that i

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,600
remember that were floated

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,360
when we did have this budget where

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,720
like well we had the usability goal for

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,079
example so

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,199
having usability um

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,160
studied on on some of the products

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,519
would it be useful would it not um

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
spending some money there could have

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
made sense right this is something that

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,519
was discussed and

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,040
in a parallel universe happened in our

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,080
lovely universe

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,199
full of pandemics didn't um

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,480
[Music]

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,920
there's like similar stuff like

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,240
we also had the privacy one uh

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,680
doing security analysis of our software

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,120
see if there's some kind of leakage of

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
some sort

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,680
this could be possible this is something

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,639
that you could hire somebody or a firm

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,320
to do

00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,880
but never did because

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,800
uh well people who are in charge didn't

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
feel like these things were

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,959
worth the amount of money which by the

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,639
way it's always speaks amounts of money

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,440
when you have to actually

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,000
hire somebody to work for a few months

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,440
or even

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,480
a consultancy which are well generally

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,480
expensive right

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,360
yeah of course

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,990
i don't see new questions in the widget

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,240
yet

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,680
[Music]

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,000
but just a reminder you can also

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,959
address questions to specific goal

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,360
champions so

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,079
for example if your question was skipped

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,399
during

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,199
their talks you can use this occasion to

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,360
re-ask it but i do have some questions

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,759
of my own

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
as well and this one is specifically for

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,639
nikola

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:59,279
and you have switched over

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,279
from blogs to videos recently how do you

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
think this change your way of

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,040
interacting with with the community and

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,680
the goal

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,240
well first of all my blog post did not

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,519
have comment sections and that was a big

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
big mistake

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,079
because now that i do videos and i get

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,399
so many youtube comments

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,920
and that's really nice because i

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,279
actually see what people

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,560
think and what issues people have with a

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,320
certain project or

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,839
designer stuff like that so that was a

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,399
big thumbs up and then there was also a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
thing that

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,320
people are more likely to watch your

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,480
videos

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,880
even more videos um like over time

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,560
if you do one blog post it's hard for a

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,920
person to like subscribe

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,800
to your rss feed whereas on youtube

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
it's likely that youtube will suggest my

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,399
videos to

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,720
people when i publish them even if they

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
don't subscribe to me so it's easier to

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,199
reach

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,959
new users and that's also helpful to

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,959
have a wider audience

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,079
and regarding this i have a took

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,160
tomorrow

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,520
at i don't remember if 8 or 10 utc

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,799
regarding my experience in the

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
doing videos for kd

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,480
okay looking forward to to seeing that

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,600
um okay and speaking of

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,240
of blogs maybe a question lydia can help

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,039
answer

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,760
and this is a leading question so be

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,960
prepared

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,400
if someone would be interested in the

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,280
goals not a specific goal

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
just what's happening in the goals lydia

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,039
do you know a way

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:48,480
how someone could read up on the updates

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,360
hmm since

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,039
not too long ago there is this dude who

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,880
is blogging

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,080
every now and then about a general

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,160
update

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,320
to ke goals i think his name is adam

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,000
and i think that blog post is showing up

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,760
on planetkde.org even

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,720
is that does it sound right to you

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,760
i think it's a perfect answer to this

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,000
prepared question

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,360
so maybe someone in the chat can link

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,200
the blog

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,160
whoever does it first gets 10 points

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
the points don't matter

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:37,840
okay i don't see any questions coming up

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,840
in the the widget yet

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,799
so maybe we can use this occasion to

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,160
go through whatever other tasks or

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,080
buffs you have related to your goals in

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,360
the coming week we already talked

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,760
about alicia's ones there's a couple of

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,960
them

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,960
regarding the apps uh goals and

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,120
also there's the one that lydia

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
mentioned which is about selecting the

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,440
next goals

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,039
later on uh maven nikola do you have any

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,320
props that people should be aware of

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,240
that we didn't mention yet

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,760
as i mentioned at the end of my

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
consistency talk i

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,360
haven't yet set them up but i will do

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,679
them i will do that

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:27,200
shortly okay

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,559
yeah and well like it was already

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
mentioned david uh

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,360
edmundson on uh has above around

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,799
well as a talk to tomorrow and vlad is

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,440
trying to find a slot for his buff for

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,679
queen as well so i can recommend those

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,679
ones

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,000
okay and the questions are coming in

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,039
so since we see

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
kde oriented devices being released are

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,799
there any queries or

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
interests from corporates to support or

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,520
sponsor a kde goal

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,200
is that open for corporate or is it just

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,840
a community

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
exercise

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,320
who wants to take that one

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:22,000
well you want to or should

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,360
yeah i i thought i could answer but then

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
i realized that

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,840
i am here as the absolute person so you

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,840
answer

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:35,520
okay uh so far this hasn't come up um

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,960
but the idea of the goals process

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,919
isn't that someone goes and sets the

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,360
agenda

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,159
for kde community by money

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,360
right but the idea is that we as a group

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,080
go through a process

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,679
that helps us figure out what's most

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,440
important right now

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:59,760
um which is kind of in conflict with

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,760
the idea idea of buying a goal

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:07,120
however if there is an organization

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:12,400
that would put in work and people

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:16,080
behind the goal please do suggest that

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,440
see if you can rally up interest uh from

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
the community

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,880
um to to get it voted in as a goal and

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
and get

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,320
people behind it and if not um the goals

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,200
process isn't the only way how to do

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,240
things in kde right there there are many

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,720
other uh

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
things happening in kde that do not have

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,559
anything to do with the goats

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,320
they obviously shouldn't work against

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:44,480
the goals

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:48,320
um there's more happening there

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
okay anyone else wants to add anything

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,799
okay let's move on what are your

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,360
thoughts

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,240
on goals related to spreading kde

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,240
culture

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,240
by improvising resources teaching

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,840
materials jotting down the history and

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,400
creating a literature

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
of kde

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
we did have an onboarding goal right

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,559
that

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,559
was almost entirely exactly that

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,679
yeah um but we could

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,919
give that whole topic another angle

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,440
and the person who is interested in that

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,080
should totally come to the buff

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,080
where we talk about upcoming goals

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,600
and suggestions

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,039
by the way when you say improv

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,360
improvising research improving i guess

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,080
in resources teaching materials

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,880
and so on i guess something related

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,559
could be

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,960
wiki to learn or something like that

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,600
maybe it could be part of the question

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,240
to

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,840
work on improving that one maybe i don't

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:08,159
know much about the proc yet

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:11,360
but i know it's within the kde umbrella

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,720
okay albert asks what

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,760
are you what you're feeling about goals

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,000
working on convincing other people to

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,679
join the goal efforts or you feel it's

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,600
only people that were already

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,600
interested in the goal working on it

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,120
i think that the reason to have a goal

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,039
is to have other people working with you

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,080
otherwise it's things that you could be

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,720
doing on your own anyway

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,679
we all have our own goals personal loan

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,640
goals

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,960
um last night i fixed the buck right did

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,320
i

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,120
make it a kitty goal no i just made a

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
merge request

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,480
what we do with the getty goals is to

00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,120
[Music]

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,080
tell the community at large please join

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,240
us and let's work

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,000
together on these topics so in itself

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,159
actually the very reason why we're

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,200
having this presentation is not because

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
we are so cool it's because china's

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,400
because we're so cool

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,200
right um if you're listening to the

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
presentation we just hadn't and thought

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,039
look at these people

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,159
they're very cute and they're doing very

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,279
useful work

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,320
thanks i think that we probably even

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,159
missed the point

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,520
because the point wasn't look at the

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,440
cool work we've done the point was

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,440
come do cool work with us right

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,960
also if not making people join us

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,360
i think it's very important for kd

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,159
contributors to respect the goals

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,120
so when you go to as an example to a

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,840
maintainer

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,880
saying i know you want to do this but

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,120
please discuss

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,640
without this change because it works

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,679
consists consistency

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,840
as an example the mentioner does

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
respect the goal and say okay let's

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,400
discuss it together

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
and that's mostly why when i read

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
messages like

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,279
ah yeah if you think consistency is

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,320
important make this merger quest

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
i get sad because why if you think

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,000
consistency

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
is important like it's a goal so yeah

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,159
okay um i have a question from benson

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,080
i'll try to

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,120
rephrase it a bit he's asking about

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,480
getting user feedback back to the

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,840
gold champions but also

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
by uh

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,200
you know where people are concerned

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,799
about their privacy so you don't

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,720
get that feedback in a way that would

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,840
violate that so what's the

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,840
what's the best way to do that

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,320
um i think that this is quite unrelated

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,880
to these goals at least

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
but since i did a lot of the user

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,200
feedback

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,240
uh work i can reply that whoever

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,960
did this question is wrong because

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,840
the premise is wrong uh it has all been

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
designed

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,440
with privacy in mind and we're not doing

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,720
anything

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,679
uh to jeopardize the

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,120
privacy of our users if if that's your

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,919
understanding

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,600
well this is something that we would

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
have to discuss or

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,799
maybe you could look at how it's

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,480
implemented but

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,679
i would please ask you not to spread uh

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,559
misinformation like that yeah telemetry

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,919
doesn't imply

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,320
uh privacy infringement it's just the

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,279
way

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,240
of other companies do and we are not a

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,039
company we are

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,000
an open source community so so those two

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
don't relate

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,200
you cannot do expect the same things

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,440
from

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,440
different things so here we

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,440
and it is disabled by default whoever

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,440
is sending information about their usage

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,120
of plasma even if it's

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,240
an anonymized uh used data

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:21,840
it's because they accepted it so there's

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,840
no privacy concern there

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,559
yeah it seems like the person who asked

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,960
the question wasn't referring to that

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,320
but

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,720
uh was asking that uh like he said

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,840
i understand the plan but i asked if

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,080
it's working

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,360
so this is regarding albert's question

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,640
about

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,559
people joining the goal

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,559
okay so i misread never mind

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,919
by the way sorry if i'm uh rephrasing so

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,720
any of those questions wrong

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,320
uh correct me in the chat and we'll

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,440
we'll deal with it

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,200
um yes we can go to average question

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,159
that says like do you think it's working

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,559
to get

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,880
other people involved with goals at this

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,880
point

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,720
i think that for consistency people who

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,640
are interesting to be part of it are

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,039
already part of it so what i'm looking

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,520
for

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,360
what uh what i'm looking for right now

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
is mostly the respect for

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,039
from other kid contributors so that when

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,840
i go to maintainers they actually

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,840
like collaborate with us

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
i think that when we do things people

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,320
respond

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,760
right but

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,919
not all goals are always active

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,919
uh or as active as they could be

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,559
everything can be done better uh and i'm

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,720
sure that all of us

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,760
are doing the best we can but all of us

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,640
we could do

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,679
uh better as well um if there's other

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,960
things that could be done

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,080
do something that if somebody wants to

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,279
help do something that probably should

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,440
be done right

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,799
because it would mean that you would get

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,360
more people uh

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,520
caring about the same things and uniting

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,399
forces which is always

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,399
interesting right

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:30,880
yeah okay another question from

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,679
me and the context here is that i'll be

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,720
i'll be trying to describe the goal

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,840
champion

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,360
raw to have it officially written

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,480
somewhere because we don't have it

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,120
have that yet and

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
my personal idea of a perfect gold

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,760
champion

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,799
is one that doesn't do any

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,480
work on the goal itself

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,919
i mean by writing code or closing bugs

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,799
etc

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,120
uh a paper a perfect gold champion would

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,240
just be the facilitator or

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,640
you know the head person to to rally up

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,200
the

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,240
community to work on the goal what do

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
you think about

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,960
that concept

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,799
well what you are describing is like a

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,559
almost like a manager basically or

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:25,679
coordinator so a big part of opens

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,720
of of our community is that

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,840
people do mostly what they want to do so

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,399
if there are some people that are great

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,279
at doing

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,320
those things but there are not many that

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,919
many are

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,120
that want to be involved in such goal or

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,720
another so it's

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,240
and on the other hand people it's really

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,960
hard to

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,799
to use this kind of role when you are

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,799
not like this yourself or

00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:02,080
when you are not willing

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:05,519
to put all your focus in this direction

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,120
so it's kind of uh ideal

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,519
for sure i i would agree but

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,519
but it's really hard to reproduce in the

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,640
open source community

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,799
i think as well

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,919
i think that we need to remember that

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,960
we're all people

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,760
and for the most part also doing this

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,039
uh thing in our free time so this means

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,440
that people should just be

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,480
comfortable with the role they they take

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,720
on

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,799
on on the project so sometimes

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,960
being a project manager can be the thing

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
that you end up needing but that doesn't

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,640
necessarily be the case

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,640
and what comes to mind is the case of

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,760
nate when he joined

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,159
the goals not only like

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,320
he started doing the goal but i think

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
that he was

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,519
mostly unknown to everyone in the

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,000
community

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,519
and while he didn't really play that

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,240
project manager

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,120
role itself he used the spotlight that

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,399
the kitty goal

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,880
gave him to well a bit like nicolo said

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,039
to

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,080
go to the different teams and saying i'm

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,159
that guy

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,279
and you listen to me because of that but

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,240
also well

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,000
for doing his uh blogs which have been

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,159
and continue being super

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,159
uh successful so i think that

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,559
the goal itself is an opportunity to

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,080
give a bit of a spotlight and reason to

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,279
be

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,320
for for the different people and

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,799
what each goal

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,960
leader uh decides to do with with that

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,679
spotlight is

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,679
well their pro prerogative also all of

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,399
the projects are very different right

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,200
like what he needed to do and what he

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,679
had to do

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,440
nate was very different from what for

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,480
example the onboarding goal had to do

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,399
which was

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,399
more of a talking to different people

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,960
kind of things and seeing

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,760
exactly which bits of information were

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,600
necessary

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,600
whereas the usability goal was

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,960
spread much thinner over

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,110
well a lot more places including

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,080
very complex code bases right

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:25,279
[Music]

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,679
yeah um people have been

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,279
um calling you the project manager or

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,840
similar position i see it

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,360
a bit different um more in the direction

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,880
of a cheerleader

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,279
um who helps others

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,039
understand and get excited about

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,919
whatever the goal is

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,559
um and since all of us have limited time

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,519
in a day

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,440
i think it is a very good idea for the

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,480
gold champion or someone

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,279
very close to that person to be that

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,919
cheerleader

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,480
and um get more people involved because

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,279
that's

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,679
the way to get significantly more done

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,600
um

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,159
as opposed to just putting all the work

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
on one person for the goal because

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,519
all the goals we have selected so far

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,079
all six of them were

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,800
much much much more work than any single

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,800
person

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,800
could and should be doing um

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,599
something that has always surprised me

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,079
but it clearly is

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,919
part of the very human nature is that

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,599
people keep joining kde

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,480
sending this email saying hello people

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,040
what do i do and then we have to give

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,399
them

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,040
an answer the goals

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,000
do give us this answer and the goal

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,960
leader

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,720
can be the person who helps that person

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,079
have an answer

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,879
my answer until the goals maybe was

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,399
just find something that uh worries you

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,480
and and fix it

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,760
right but i can understand that this is

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,040
probably too

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,280
wishy-washy for uh some people to turn

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,480
this energy into something that they

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,920
can't just start

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,359
doing on the next five minutes right uh

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,119
having a goal properly documented with

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,599
tasks that they can understand

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,320
and and well they can relate to is

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,839
probably

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,760
easier than telling them just go to

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,640
bugzilla and find a

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,079
crash and solve it because i mean

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,240
there's literally

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,079
hundreds of thousands of tickets over

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
there uh a lot of them that are

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,520
non-actionable

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,520
so that doesn't help much

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,800
okay thank you very much for the input

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,720
i'll use all of it when i be describing

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,760
the gold champion role later on um

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,640
a different question uh

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,440
since there are people watching here

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,520
that

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,880
maybe now thinking about hey maybe i'm

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,119
gonna be the next

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,320
gold champion i i have a great idea i

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,440
want to push it

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,560
as i call for the whole kde community as

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,200
current champions

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,960
what tip would you give to the to the

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,960
person that is thinking about it right

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
now

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,440
maybe to write a good detailed

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,839
task description because if you just

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,480
like

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,000
a paragraph and say okay that's it you

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,760
got my idea

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,560
that's not going to work if you write

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,680
down i think we should this this this

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,240
this this these issues let me give

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
practical examples that's going to help

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,839
you

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,839
help people understand what you mean

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,400
yeah in practice it's a like we're in

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,640
this

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,760
not so ideal position we want to move

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,520
into this

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:59,520
idealistic wall of wonder

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:03,440
and describe this this heroes path

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,760
that you as the gold person who proposes

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,079
it

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,839
you're gonna at the very least narrate i

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,960
think that this is a

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,560
proper way of looking at it like if you

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,640
wanted to say

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,760
all of the icons should be blue then you

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,800
have to talk about

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,160
how uncomfortable you are today

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,680
about the icons being super colorful and

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,520
you want to live in a world where all of

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,000
the icons are blue

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,880
and if people get excited by that

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,880
they're gonna vote it

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,000
okay thank you very much i think we

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,599
we are running out of time so uh

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,200
any prospering future gold champions

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,119
check the schedule for the buff that

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,160
will talk about the future

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,480
goals and

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,280
thank you very much lydia and the gold

00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,720
champions

00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,720
for this roundtable of questions
