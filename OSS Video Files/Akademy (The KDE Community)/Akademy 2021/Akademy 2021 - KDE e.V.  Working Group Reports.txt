00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,680
all right

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,520
with the first people already here maybe

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,880
we can start a bit early because there's

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,439
a lot of content to

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,439
get through

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,920
all right so welcome everyone

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,359
to the report of the working groups the

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,800
working groups are a really

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:39,520
important part of kbe uv and they help

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,280
we do work on really important topics

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
we have several of those working groups

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,079
and they will now talk a bit about

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
their work over the last year and we

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,520
will start with comments we will talk

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,280
about the community working group

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
hello hello can you yes thank you very

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
much

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,480
so basically the community working group

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
is the people that you will try to talk

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,680
to if

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,600
something wrong is happening or if

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
somebody is annoying you or if there is

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
any kind of

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,240
firefighter if people are not actually

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,400
following the code of conduct or if you

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,479
basically just want a shoulder to cry on

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,880
for a bit we are good shoulders we can

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
listen

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
but 2020 was really tough

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,320
on a lot of people and sometimes it was

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,200
because of kde sometimes it was because

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,799
of the word sex sometimes it was because

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,000
corona and sometimes no

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,680
sometimes just happened and

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,520
when you can't really be around people

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,720
things will get bad we are

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,960
we are beings we are social beings

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
we like to use social networks we like

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,399
to use twitter and we are social

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
problems we couldn't be as social as we

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
wanted

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,920
on this year so a lot of people started

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
to misbehave

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
and because of that we had to actually

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,160
remove and this was one of the first

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
instances that we actually had to remove

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,319
a blog

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
from the planets because of misbehavior

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,680
the second block that we

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,440
removed from the planet was not because

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
of misbehavior but because of the

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
person's request so that does not really

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
counts

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
the same block that we removed from the

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,000
kd planets we

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
had to also remove we asked them to

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
remove

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,840
from the free desktop as the free

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,000
desktop

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
foundation i don't remember the name of

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,239
the planets

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,680
just free desktops something because of

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
the same

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,000
violations and we had a severe

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
case of incidents on

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
telegram because of a rogue

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,599
administration um

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,120
someone was not feeling well and he

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,200
had a problem and the problem

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,840
was really intense for him and he

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760
started to lash out on people

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
problem is that because telegram is

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,800
telegram we could not do anything we

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
could not

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,360
remove ownership we could not even talk

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,560
to telegram the basic regular

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,760
and this went on for more than

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,120
three months with threats

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:28,640
real threats in the end he

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,640
move on our work in the past year was

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,159
a lot of people started to commit to

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,760
master

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,519
without using merger requests

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
please don't do that this is not nice

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,560
for your fellow developer

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,239
and when that happened code was started

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,360
being reverted with other approval

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,560
reviews like also please don't do that

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
talk to people communicate

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
video will be better if people

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,879
communicate and code

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
being refused for qt for compatibility

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
people

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,200
34 is 10 years old and we don't

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,840
have any kind of update from the kills

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
company

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,480
let kills four die please

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,480
it's time to let the pass go

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,760
let's not learn it well we can count on

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
the communities even

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,759
non-kd communities we can count on get

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,400
on we can count on the free desktop

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
and they will help us i had a few

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,479
meetings with

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
vietnam talking about the code of

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,960
conduct talk about how to

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
deal with um communities uh this also

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
happened with the free desktop

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
but we also realized that we can't count

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
on telegrams management

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,479
they basically ignored everything that

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,360
we tried to talk to them

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,280
and we cannot ignore red flags if we see

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,440
a red flag talk to us

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
because red flags tends to grow

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,880
please next and we have

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,199

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,880

thank you thomas and thank you community

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,840
working group

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,840
and with that i hand over to olaf

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
yeah hello i'm presenting about the kde

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,080
free cute foundation

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,520
the kde frequent foundation is a legal

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,479
construct created by kde and trolltag

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,600
and and so it has been around many many

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,600
years now

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,000
it ensures that qt will always be

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,319
available as free software

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680
kbe has two representatives in the

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
foundation

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
and since last academy the two

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,600
representatives are supported by a

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,080
working group

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,759
during the past year the main topic was

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,319
the decision of the cute company to

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
limit

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
long-term support releases to paying

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
customers

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the legal agreements that we have

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,560
require that the cute company

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
open source all cute releases after one

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
year

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
so for kde of course the main question

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
was what do we do

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,440
in the meantime for supporting qt5

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,280
we decided to tackle this question not

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,319
through the foundation itself

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,759
because it's not mainly a legal question

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,720
um instead it was mainly the kdev board

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
working on it

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
um together with volunteers from the

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
frequent working group

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
and now i hand over to frederick glatton

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,599
who will now talk about

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,479
this working group a bit more thanks

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,960
yeah

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
so thank you olaf it's awesome all the

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
work you've been putting in together

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
with martin

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,880
maybe we just go to the next slide i

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,319
just want to say who we are

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,360
not talk too much about things happening

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,400
in the background

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,680
um yeah we have martin connold and olaf

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,560
who just presented the freaky

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,840
foundation and of course they are part

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,199
of the working group because we are

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,639
there to support them

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:57,759
and then there's albert chris david

00:07:52,639 --> 00:08:00,000
ikami yeah hopefully you know some of us

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
we have been around for a while and we

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,120
of course do care about

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
cute and kd so

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
we are there to support the frequent

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,560
foundation

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,000
we discuss various issues we

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,440
um yeah well our interest is not always

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
hundred percent aligned with what the

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,759
cute company does we try to find

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
good solutions we look at technical

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
things like okay

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,919
what is actually changing cute five to

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,719
six do we have to be aware of changes

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:36,000
is there something missing or so and um

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,360
yeah that's basically it uh

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
we tried to inform the kdev membership a

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,279
bit and

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,200
olaf took the last two points here so

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,200
i think we can just move on yeah thank

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,279

thank you frederico and everyone else

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
who is helping us

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
um ensure that qt stays free software

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,519
and available to kde

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
and then let's go to business and this

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,480
admin working group

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,920
hello uh so um

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,880
next slide please so

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,760
we are basically looking after the

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,040
servers and various services of kde

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,240
uh so we have

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,279
so some of the data points so

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
in this one when this presentation was

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
written

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,720
it was april month uh so there are 40

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,240
terabytes of data in april month

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
uh 198 fab requests per second on

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
average

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
and uh some of our front tanks are words

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,760
like

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,800
syrian 17 7 and cloudflare handles

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,160
some of more requests and

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,279
we have almost 500 thousand

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,800
emails per week every week

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,839
so we have four members right now ben

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,200
nicholas myself and candy

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,640
and there are some members who are

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,560
uh who are involved in uh

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,839
handling some specific servers and

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
systems next slide

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,399
so we uh one of the

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,680
very far major thing we did

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,760
this year was a development of

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,040
my kde so it's a complete replacement

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,000
well not complete yet just yet but it is

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
internet to be replacement of our kitty

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
identity

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,480
which is like uh it's a pain

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:41,279
major pain point right now and so

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:45,440
yeah uh that is based on auto and

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,800
newer my kd already handles uh

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,560
login for several services like wiki's

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,839
academic sites and things like that

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,800
uh next slide

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
we also improved several services like

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
we

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
changed our mirror management software

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,079
uh

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,240
we that brought some more uh

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,959
improvements because the mirror brain

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,959
was

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,399
pretty much updated slash out of support

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:20,079
um and at the same time we

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,200
also deployed directs for maps.kerry.org

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,240
thank you walker for help on this

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,560
and uh yeah so this

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,959
also makes it possible to use higher

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,720
quality vector-based maps on

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,279
clients like marble or kitty itinerary

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,279
next line

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,920
we also try to basically uh get rid of

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,760
some of the services

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,800
and try to consolidate these things

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:55,600
uh so we uh you know

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,680
we basically uh put some of the server

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
some of the python entry applications on

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,160
the single server

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
we also got rid of keto lite instance

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
which was

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,800
basically only for cray neon

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,079
depositories

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,760
and also ported over git hooks to python

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,440
3 because

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:22,240
why not who uses python 2 anymore

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,240
next we also updated several of systems

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,639
the upgrade happens by having a totally

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
new server

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
and basically setting it up instead of

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
like just upgrading

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,600
some servers in place uh

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,440
and some of the servers are replaced

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,880
this this way

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,120
uh the more details of this are in

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
the reports written reports we have sent

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,639
on kb

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,639
membership mail english uh next slide

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,880
please

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
uh so there are some topics where we

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,800
need help um

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,959
they are on the next slide uh so yeah

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,560
so one of the key goal we want to

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,040
achieve next year is

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,120
uh introduction of gitlab ci to replace

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,320
both bitlocker8.org

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,160
binary factory and also

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,800
sort out our saturation regarding

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,240
collaborative editors on circuitry.org

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,240
because it is using ldap as a backend

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
right now and its performance is pretty

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,600
brutal

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,720
so we need to figure out replacement

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,639
and sort of situation and this also

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
involves that we need to upgrade our

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
next cloud

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,440
which requires a newer server and

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
because

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
like for example next cloud wants newer

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,839
libraries so we

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,880
want something like open to 24 servers

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,440
so there are three topics right now but

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
surely we do have more topics uh you can

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
reach us

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,760
in kdc's admin channel or

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
you can also ping us in private if you

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,399
have any questions

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,399
uh yeah that's it

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,160
thank you bhushan that's a ton of stuff

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
i hand over to new features for the

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,440
advisory board working group

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,079
thank you yeah i can't record

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,720
the next slide please thank you so the

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,279
vibe vertical has a goal of ensuring

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,880
good relationships between kde and all

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,680
our important partners

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,519
and we also represent the collaboration

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,399
in general with this organization

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,720
and other communities are part of our

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,720
port

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,440
next slide please so as you can see

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,959
there are many people of us

david kai and thomas who are our

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,680
contacts to

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
many of the organizations that are part

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,000
of the board

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,120
next slide what

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,320
our tasks are first of all we organize

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,160
uh advisory board calls to make sure all

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
our organizations stay close to us they

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,839
are updated about what's currently

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
happening within our community and our

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
products

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,160
and that we have a chance to communicate

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,360
with each other both

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,120
the the kde and the

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,959
partners but also the partners between

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
them so they can compose discuss on

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,519
topics and exchange

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,519
knowledge we also act as contact persons

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
for the members of the acadia advisory

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,240
board these include our

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,040
kde patrons and also all the allied

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,079
communities

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,199
ngos with in our ecosystem that can be

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,079
part of our advisory board and we are

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
available for

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,759

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,839
inputted questions from these

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,519
organizations in regard to kde

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
and we're also responsible for getting

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
them in touch with the key projects

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,839
projects or contributors

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,880
that might help them on specific topics

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
or if they have

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,839
have specific questions that they need

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,839
answers to

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
so to share some updates that happen

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,320
since the previous academy

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,079
we held one advisory board called on in

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,040
january earlier this year

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
our many topics including uh included

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,759
the outcome

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
of our two major events academy and

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
lands that this year

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
they were taking place for the first

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,880
time online so

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,000
we had our whole experience and lessons

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
learned

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
from these events to share we had all

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,199
the updates on the queues

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,480
that they could difficult on the board

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,560
already mentioned

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,839
at the working group we had the updates

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,639
from our goal we have

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,560
many developments in kdev and also we

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
had many new partners to share

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,839
so we discussed a bit on all those

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,320
topics um

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,160
we also brought up the discussion about

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,160
making a living around kiwi this is

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,759
something that other organizations in

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,560
our network are doing

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,600
but in parallel so there was a lot of

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,199
discussion there

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,160
knowledge to be exchanged and we're

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,720
still trying to figure out things

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,920
on our end with the help of our partners

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
um

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,319
so in terms of our uh plans

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,799
for 2021 we also discuss um

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,720
all the new events that we have coming

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,760

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,760
happy to have

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,799
these two new hardware partners which

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,440
also say

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,240
showcases our let's say commitment to

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,000
increase those

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,480
kind of partnerships and

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,919
our key goals uh going forward for the

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,840
next year we want to at least

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
hold one more call by the end of the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,440
year this is one of our

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,679
plans to hold at least two calls every

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,039
year so we can stay in touch with our

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,120
our our partners ideally maybe we can

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,600
hold another one by the end of the year

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,880
so we can make it three this year that

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,080
would be great

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,799
um what we also want to do is start

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,720
poking on our contacts more frequently

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
because we have many issues coming up as

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,440
we

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,960
mentioned our organization is growing

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,679
and we believe we have lots

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,039
lots of things to learn from partners

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,919
that are already at

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,080
other stages of their growth so we have

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,080
experiences to share on policies and

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,240
best practices on how to

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
handle our hiring how to manage our

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,480
staff and contractors

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,120
and all those kind of topics where we

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,799
can draw

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,679
information and knowledge from what our

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,679
partners are doing

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,760
so if you if you want to join us and ask

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
us something feel free to reach out to

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,160
the advisory board contacts

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,640
at kde.org and we'll be happy to to

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,640
respond

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,200
i think that's all from us thank you

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,919
thank you for just um kyle is

just now having computer problems so we

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,480
will skip ahead

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,480
to the financial working group

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,480
with ikea and get back to

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,120
the fundraising working group after that

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,919
okay

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,520
yeah hello um we actually have a couple

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,000
of new phases in the financial looking

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
group

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,440
and we are immediately throwing them

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,919
into the cold water

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,039
and giving the first or the second slide

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,400
after the title

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,039
to till adam so time to turn on your

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
camera i think

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,200
i'm trying

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,919
can you hear me at least yes we can hear

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,559
you

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:04,400
okay very well here lovely

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,400
now you should be able to see me also

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,120
hi there uh hi everyone i'm till

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,840
i've i started contributing to kde uh 19

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
years ago

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,039
so i'm looking forward to my 20 year

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,840
anniversary

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,240
i used to contribute to kde pym lately i

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,720
do

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,480
suit staff so i didn't get to go all

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,159
right the financial working group

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,720
basically what we do is we try and

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
support the membership the community and

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
the board

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,760
with financial stuff because we have the

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,640
misfortune of working in that kind of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,320
space

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,400
try and contribute our experience there

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,640
so we help the treasurer

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
we help make decisions and suggestions

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799
to the board

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,400
yeah anything around numbers commercial

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,480
money

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
we try to communicate to the community

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
and to the outside around financial

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
stuff

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,880
we help with the reports obviously that

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,000
the treasurer does and

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,559
we maybe crucially help with the budget

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
um which we will be talking about in a

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,400
little bit

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,360
so next slide please

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,200
um we've had a complete turnover in the

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,640
membership of this

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,200
working group um i

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
think i think i was in the working group

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,280
before so i'm

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,640
kind of returning um

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,120
basically um

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,919
yeah myself and martha are completely

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,679
new

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,600
um ike of course is still the treasurer

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,880
so he's part of the working group as

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,159
part of that um your features are still

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,640
around but not in the working group

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,640
anymore and i think david is still

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,360
around for the purposes of this

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,360
report but will then be phasing out

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,799
okay i can yeah um before i take that

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,960
slide um

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,880
let me tell you thank you to everyone

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,760
who was in the financial working group

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,799
up until now

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,520
and here they did your futures you all

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,000
did great work and helped very much

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,559
david

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
i think has decided unfortunately to

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,960
move on to the community working group

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
to spread his awesomeness there i will

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
very much

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,880
miss his colorful presentations of our

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
colorful charts but we get them one

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,320
last time for them this year so i look

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,000
forward to that already

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,919
but yeah 2020 um we had um

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,159
quite a year didn't we um we originally

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,600
had a budget plan then we decided to

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,799
kind of start over as

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,880
things were getting weird we decided

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,760
that we could decide a lot so we decided

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,159
to get more conservative as a result and

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,960
maybe not take as many risks as we

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,960
otherwise might have

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,400
overall though we came through it really

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,360
really well um

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
if anything the pandemic largely um

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,720
simplified

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,159
in our finances because um one of our

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,039
largest financial activities is

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,799
generally

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,200
organizing and funding events and

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,000
subsidizing travel towards them

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,640
that really didn't happen in 2020 so

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,280
overall there was much less to do

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
our income sources remain stable or in

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,679
fact

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:10,960
improved our one-time donations from

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,679
just regular individuals and

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,720
other live contributors increased by

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,840
around 40

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,720
so people felt really generous i

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,799
cannot explain why really it's quite

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,559
fascinating either we did just amazing

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,000
work and people were more excited about

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,240
kde as a result

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
or people really wondered who might be

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,440
hurting during the pentagon

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,520
who could i be helping and decided

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
kde was worth their attention and love

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,120
in any case

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,440
thank you very much to all our donors we

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,120
also received them on top of that a very

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,720
large one-time donation by the handshake

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,679
foundation again

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,360
thank you to them as well what did

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,480
decrease unfortunately is our income

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,279
from the student

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,840
membership programs that sum of code and

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,919
code in

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,760
that we've done together with google for

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,120
many years

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,159
this is not unexpected we've seen that

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,279
trending down year over year in terms of

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,279
enthusiasm

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,440
our participation and um i think that is

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,320
also even going beyond towards other

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
organizations

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,000
who participate in these programs as

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,480
well overall

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,080
our financial assets once again grew in

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,159
2020 we have

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,279
more cash than ever and we need to start

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,760
spending it

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,000
and now have a bit of a zoom in on the

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,279
details

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,200
charts so everything's

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,880
generally been quite consistent except

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,080
for 2018 which was

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,559
mental in in this current year we've

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,840
somewhat regressed back to you mean if

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,480
you don't include

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
a big large one-time donation we

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
actually did slightly worse than some of

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,120
our previous years

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
this is partly because we normally get a

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,799
little bit more of academy

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,559
which was a bit different last year but

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,360
because we got that additional one-time

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,640
donation

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,120
we're still slightly up from the

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,039
previous years except for 2018

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,039
which was mental next slide

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,640
expenses we have massive reserves and

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
every year we say we're trying to spend

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
more than we earn because we're a

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
non-profit we shouldn't be earning a

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,000
profit

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,559
and every year we fail again this was

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,720
partly

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,799
because of academy not really going

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,559
exactly as intended

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,320
so we spent even lesser we planned to

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,760
and less than previous years because of

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
it and as i

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,480
mentioned we've got more profit by

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
accident

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,440
and if we look in detail try and break

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,799
that down

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,200
income mostly came from these individual

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,279
donations and that massive one-time

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
handshake donation

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,919
and all our other fundings are trending

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,679
down from previous years

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,559
expenses primarily staff and contractors

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
and we'll see this is going to be taking

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,799
up

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,200
a large part of our expenditures moving

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,200
forwards

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
all right so as for the plan we will of

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
course try to

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,159
yet again do a better job of spending

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
money hopefully more successfully this

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,880
time

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,640
uh the income is expected to remain

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,279
stable has actually already been stable

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,760
through

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,400
q1 uh the main way of spending more

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,600
money

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,440
is the contract more uh we can go into

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,559
some detail about what that is as you

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,520
can see on the slide

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,400
it's blower angle it's uh krita and

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,520
other things

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,039
um that is in the process of happening

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,400
so we're pretty confident that we can in

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,600
fact spend that money

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,240
this year um and overall of course we

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,640
as mentioned have to spend money because

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
um

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,320
we are a non-profit and we can't be

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,679
sitting on the money so we are

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,760
yet again uh expecting basically a

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,799
stable situation with higher spending

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,799
let's see how that plays out

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,640
yep um so how's it been going so far

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,240
this year

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,480
it's always nice to do academy in the

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,799
middle of the year because um then

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,200
we can not just look back at 2020 but

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,520
also some of the current year

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,279
um so far things have been going really

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,120
well um as mentioned already in the

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,480
board report we gained two new payments

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,240
this year

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,320
they're both hardware companies and

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,760
that's that's quite interesting

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,880
like uh also mentioned previously we see

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,720
that kind of

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
relationship growing and expanding and

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,399
happening more often

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,679
in recent years also for example this

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,200
year's academy we have

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,520
remarkable as a new sponsor for the

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,360
first time who also make an exciting

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,240
linux-based device

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,120
so devices and embedded stuff around it

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
keeps happening

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,279
that's quite exciting expect further

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,120
growth there in the future

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,840
um we also got a very large one-time

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,240
donation by pine 64 in relation

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,760
to their release of the pine phone kd

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,799
community edition

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,399
thank you very much for that in general

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,120
donation income remains stable

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,840
and also turns up we've seen about a 10

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,880
improvement

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,600
across almost every type of donation in

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,480
the first quarter

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,480
um we have um received most of the

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,200
outstanding payments related to 2020

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,039
activities

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,720
and if you look very closely into the

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,679
fine print of those charts

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,039
and that you just saw one of the reasons

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,640
why the income bar

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,520
for 2020 was a little bit down

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,240
versus 2019 is that um some payments

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,640
were late

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,000
that had to do with when we invoiced

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,240
them partially

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,760
um if you have added that outstanding

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
income on top you would have actually

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,760
been slightly after 20

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,080
and 2019 bar unfortunately we've

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,840
received most of them by now for example

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,039
the sponsorship proceeds from linux

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,399
absolute

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,640
from that year so that's good

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,000
um travel expenditure has continued to

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,600
be zero we've not had

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
any physical events um but

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
we may see that towards the end of the

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,720
year at least we're prepared for it

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
and so if any physical events do happen

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
this year still

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,919
then we might see some um

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,600
expenditure there um hiring for the new

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,120
contractor positions that

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,200
i haven't mentioned has progressed so

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,840
far as planned and we made a plan

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,799
to create these positions all throughout

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,840
the year and do them

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,080
at once we have contracted

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,039
two new folks to work on technical

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
documentation

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,640
and documentation infrastructure in

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,919
support of the

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,159
kde community already and

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,559
we will be proceeding with the other

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,159
hiring in the coming months

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,760
so 2022 is going to get interesting

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,480
because we expect at least

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,000
a substantial return to physical travel

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,679
in physical events

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
and we will have all of these new

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600
contractors and

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
so we will see the combined effects of

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,480
that and the

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,520
combined effect on our expenses

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,360
specifically

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,320
which will be very high so 2022 will

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,320
also be

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
the year where we have to evaluate our

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,520
fundraising

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
and we have to make sure that what we

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,440
are doing

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,320
can become sustainable for a longer time

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
future

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,840
so we have a lot to do in the financial

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,120
working group next year and in the

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,279
community as a whole

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,279
but overall um it's a really exciting

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,399
place to be we've finally grown our

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,399
resources um

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,840
to the point where we can you know

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,240
dispatch and actually

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,200
implement some of these new activities

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
and um

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,640
yeah these are good problems to have

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,320
really so

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
looking forward to doing good work next

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
year all right

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
and if you have any questions i don't

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
think we have time for that but

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,600
um do ask them in the chat i can or we

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,840
can as a group respond there as well

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,640
thank you yeah please do ask questions

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,000
in the chat

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,039
and now we can go back to carl um

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,159
for the fundraising working group

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,039
to um tell us how

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,880
people can actually help us make all

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,559
this

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:18,559
planning that the financial working

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:32,559
group has done work

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:34,880
we can't hear you yet carl it seems

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:47,679
the computer gods do not like call today

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:50,080
it seems

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,960
car it seems that your mic is connected

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,159
with blue buttons

00:31:50,960 --> 00:32:01,840
it might be a system what issue

00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,840
choose another mic or something

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,440
and now that it works yeah

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,360
okay perfect uh so um are you the one

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,720
that is a report for the founding this

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,720
fundraising working group

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:40,840
the food within a working group tried to

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:43,840
fund to fund freezing opportunities

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
to

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and other maintains uh artificial

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,679
infrastructures aren't

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,279
the donation systems like for example

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,279
cbcrm relate.kd.org and

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,519
the donation buttons everywhere on the

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,080
academy websites

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,640
and we try to coordinate with the power

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:11,840
team

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:11,840
and for our friends

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,559
foreign um

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,760
what we did last year uh we uh

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,159
uh worked with the cc land protectors so

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,880
yeah he had new protectors and tried to

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,640
improve the

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,720
infrastructures i want to relate that

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,960
his arc

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,039
we also move it towards communication to

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,159
uh from telecom to matrix

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:50,840
that makes me really happy

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,600
we had multiple meetings at on meet the

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,519
key.org make it

00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,640
one month enough that we didn't

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,840
achieve it every month

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,039
um we also have reached the

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,720
video design of right.org and

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,440
the donation patch and king.org

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,879
with a new quick design and if you as a

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,919
tweet to make it easier

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,480
to work on ccrm

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,040
with a docker setup but you guys can

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,839
clone

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,440
and just run the comments and our

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,599
complete cvm setup

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,800
already uh our plans for the future near

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,159
future

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,399
we uh we tried to

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,200
do the thing that you promised to do uh

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,079
last year's

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,040
the last two years uh that means like

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,919
seeing the

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:49,359
uh non-decreasing the exclusive act

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,359
so but because we are handling sensitive

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,399
informations like

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,680
the contacts of the donators and

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,800
it's not be nice for the argument i want

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,640
on that

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,400
maybe either try to support the

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,560
fundraising effort for our linux

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,480
absolute

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,440
collective goodies for people who need

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,119
for the net for kden campaigns

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,920
and also improve the working

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,920
communications

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,599
that is very cool

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,119
uh which means we have a tiny bit of

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,800
time for q and a

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,359
um if there are any questions adam

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,760

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,960
has already responded to one in the chat

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,880
uh i could you want to reiterate that

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,119
uh question and answer here live or

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,560
skip to the next one i can totally do

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,640
that um if you want

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,280
um so sorry the question was

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,400
um one that goes i went out to all

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,520
working groups which

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,520
is um what is the thing that

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,520
everyone can do to help the working

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,280
groups be more effective

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,119
for the financial working group the main

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,440
thing is really continue to do

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,880
awesome awesome work in your kde

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,760
projects and

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,760
anything that makes the public excited

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,960
you know it helps with fundraising which

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,640
makes

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,560
our work i would say more stress-free

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,680
and more enjoyable um

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,599
it's as you heard spending money is not

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,480
easy if you have it actually it's quite

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,040
difficult

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
but it's so much better than being

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,280
strapped for it

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,480
so yeah that that really helps the most

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,839
um the other thing

00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,160
is just um we deal with a lot of

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,200
the kdvs financial documents and

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,800
bookkeeping

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,880
so anything that makes that easy and

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,200
saves a little bit of time like um if

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,880
you use

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,000
reimbursements.key.org and you're really

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,240
timely and

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,079
good there on filing all your info and

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,240
all your receipts that helps

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,400
and if you send kdv money via money

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,480
transfer writing a good memo

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,640
so it's easy to see what the transfer is

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,839
about these types of things really you

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,680
know it

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,240
makes some of the tedious work you know

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,359
a little bit more enjoyable

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,480
so or a big process so

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,320
that helps okay

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,320
thanks that question was to all working

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,040
groups so i'll ask it again and

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
then you can jump in as you want so

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,000
what's

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,680
a thing that the board membership or

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,240
wider community can do

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,000
to help your work or improve your

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,640
effectiveness

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,400
i think for the free cute support

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,720
working group

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,520
we mostly would benefit from somebody

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,520
that can

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,520
push us a bit to have regular meetings

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,920
we're all super busy and it's very easy

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,800
to forget about this stuff

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,520
when life gets busy so having somebody

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,920
that

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,280
feels like they can just make sure that

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,200
once a month we meet

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,920
that would be awesome we're mostly

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,880
looking at people inside the kdev since

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,040
we do

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,000
handle some sensitive information and we

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,400
don't want to

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,920
drag stuff out public unnecessarily when

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,200
negotiations are ongoing

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,000
i think everybody understands that

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,800
should i just pass on uh who wants to be

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,920
next

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,760
card did that let's add to that for the

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,079
kde frequent working group

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,839
um given the wider picture i think it's

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,240
very very helpful but

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,079
so many kde people are also involved in

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,200
cute project

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:51,119
and generally um being visible

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
about that you're now using qts3

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,280
software

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,640
and contributing to cute and using cute

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,800
um

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,560
with a commercial contract are not

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,640
exclusive to each other

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,760
make that visible that it's it can

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,480
really be

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,839
um a great cooperation where everyone

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,480
finishes but wherever

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,480
um benefits

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,319
from our site advisory board if you are

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,880
in close contact with another fossil

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,520
organization that could join and it will

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,440
add value to our advisor board please

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,839
bring out this contact with them

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,960
see how we can cooperate if you are

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,520
close to maybe a

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,960
corporation get them to be patron

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,240
patrons it will also help the

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,599
fundraising working group and the

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,160
financial working group

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,440
and then they can join in our our

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,680
advisory board and

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,839
have all that knowledge in the port as

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,839
well

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,599
so from the six admin side i think uh

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,599
it's emotionally on the technical side

00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,079
as i mentioned like in the mice

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,240
in the last slide of our presentation we

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,960
outlined some of the issues

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,520
uh we also have a gitlab part where you

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,920
can

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,200
find our some of our tasks and

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,079
so yeah you can jump on those stars

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,079
and help us

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,720
from the feminism group it's mostly

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,040
about trying to find

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,760
although either address solves or

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,800
seriously

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:34,480
problems or eyebrows found

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:36,800
viable alternatives to a cvc

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,280
yeah i really starting to get a list of

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,240
requirements and

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,680
identities that we could use and we need

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,839
to

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,839
decide what to do next

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,359
okay if that was everyone then i think

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,160
it's

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,200
time to switch over to the next one

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,640
thank you very much

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,760
questions and presenting the

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,760
