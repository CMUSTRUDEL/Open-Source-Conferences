Title: Akademy 2021 - I Cant Work Like This
Publication date: 2021-06-28

Description: 
	By Patricia Aas

Making software products can be fraught with conflicts, where people in different roles may feel sabotaged by others. In this talk I present a model for thinking about the problems we solve and how we solve them, and using that I hope to convince you that team excellence comes from our differences, rather than in spite of them. Hopefully you'll walk away with a deeper understanding of that colleague that never writes tests, or the one that constantly complains that all you do is "make bugs".

[Music]

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,760
thanks alesh

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,960
and with that let's welcome patricia

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,160
with the talk

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,199
i can't work like this welcome

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,000
thank you thank you so much

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:35,120
um so thank you for having me

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,640
and good morning

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,760
i'd like to welcome you uh to bugs as a

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
service

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
this will be our company for this

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,200
morning bugs as a service makes a

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
bug tracker a plus plus it's a fancy

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
company

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,120
um but it's a very small company it's a

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,120
small team

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,640
let me also introduce our problem

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
a problem is here represented as a

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,039
purple ball

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
we don't know much about this problem uh

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,680
we

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
aren't really sure if it's a serious

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
problem we're not

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,479
exactly sure if it is a problem at all

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,479
and if it is a problem

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,560
we're not exactly sure if we have to fix

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,439
it right now or if it's easy to fix or

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,720
even if it will take a long time to fix

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,200
so it's a very very unclear problem that

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
we have

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
now let's say that we could place that

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,320
problem

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
in some sort of system so let's say that

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,840
we could say it was a red

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,799
problem or a yellow problem or a blue

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
problem or

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,360
a green problem maybe if we could

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,200
classify the problem somehow

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,399
that would tell us something

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
but maybe how we solve problems tells us

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,119
more

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
about the problem itself like maybe we

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
could distinguish

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,200
different problems from each other by

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,560
thinking about how we solve problems

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,880
so down here let's imagine that we have

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
prices now this could be like an

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,040
everyday crisis like um

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,159
a house full of three-year-olds for

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,280
example

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,280
these are unfolding crises like stuff

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
will happen you can't just sit down and

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
pretend

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
it's not there things will happen like

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
if your house is burning down you can

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,560
pretend it's not but it will burn to the

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
ground

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
so these are things that if you not

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,360
don't do anything about it

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,239
it will resolve itself and probably not

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,239
in a way that you like

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,920
now up here we have other types of

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,720
problems now these are problems that you

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,800
you you don't necessarily know what the

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,640
problem is or how to solve it so you

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,599
kind of have to experiment

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,319
try out different things debug try to

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,920
learn so

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,360
there's a lot of unknowns in this

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800
scenario uh

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
so a lot of detective work to try to

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
figure things out

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,440
whereas up here you have really nice

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,040
problems delineated problems you know

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
what the problem is you know how to

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,239
solve the problem

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,400
you're not really worried about that you

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
know that the problem can be solved

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
now you're thinking more what is the

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
best way to solve these kinds of

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,000
problems

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
like there are several ways but what is

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
the best way for us

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,360
maybe there's this you know you you have

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,959
a you have a

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,959
tradition of engineering of best

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,120
practices that you want to apply to the

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,200
problem

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
down here we have great wonderful

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,640
problems these are problems that are

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,400
solved with automation and routine

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,799
these are problems we know exactly how

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
to do we just have to do it

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,720
you know sometimes we might realize that

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
there's some bug in our automation

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
or maybe some steps missing from our

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
checklist

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,840
but this is stuff that we can fix so

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,599
that next time we do it better

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,879
but we know how to solve these problems

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,480
now you have certain people that tend to

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,440
work in parts of this

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,159
and and and so so this this system by

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,159
the way

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,080
is is uh often called the connection

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,640
framework it's made by a guy named

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
dave snowden and he talks about it as a

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
sense

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
making framework and it has like names

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
for these different things

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,159
so down here he calls this a chaotic

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
domain

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,640
and this is the complex domain and here

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
is the complicated domain and down here

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,920
is the clear domain so they

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,079
they have names but i want to talk about

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,919
more about the people who work there

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,080
so you have certain people who tend to

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,400
work mostly in one domain

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
uh so here we have ellis he works for

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,960
for bugs as a service

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
ellis started off his career as a as a

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,479
graphical designer

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
and now he's his official title is

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,639
probably ux designer

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
uh but he does all things design and

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,759
creative at this very small team

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
at bugs as a service he's a very

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
creative person he probably

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,000
would he wants to be an artist maybe and

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
he likes to play music so he actually

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
has a soundcloud just in case you know a

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,000
tweet goes viral at some point

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,000
um and then and he he likes to to

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
try to figure out what is the best thing

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
for the users and

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,199
and and and does a lot of like

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,240
off-the-wall thinking

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,720
and and just throwing ideas out there

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
now pure is alex alex does not throw

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
ideas out there

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
that's not what he does he will throw

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,520
solutions out there

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
if you give him a problem he will try to

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
give you a solution

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,240
alex is also a little bit tired of his

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,479
job uh

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
he's more interested in the stuff that

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,720
he does at home

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,080
and how he does he likes to play video

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
games and he also

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,720
likes to do a home automation and all

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,120
sorts of like little pet projects and

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
open source stuff that he has going on

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
that's really what keeps him going

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
because he kind of thinks his job is a

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,680
little bit boring

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,800
but down here we have bailey

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,560
and bailey loves her job bailey loves

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
her job because it basically means that

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,600
she can make order out of chaos

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,199
so bailey is an sre or a psych

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
reliability engineer

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
but she used to be just as called

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
assistant

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
her basic basic role she feels like it's

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,199
just to keep the world

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,880
from going descending into chaos

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,800
uh so everything has to have a system

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,680
there should be orders she's not a big

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,880
fan of

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,680
of ellis's off the wall ideas either she

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
thinks

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
that we should have a plan and we should

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,199
follow it and no one should be

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,199
all too creative about the world

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,759
down here we have parker parker is an

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,759
instant responder

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,759
and this means that parque has a very

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,880
strange kind of personality

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,840
so when the world is on fire parker is

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,160
smiling

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
when everyone feels like oh my gosh and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
everyone is super stressed out

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,599
parker is like finally my moment is here

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,479
so parker will smile at in the most

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,759
inopportune moments where things really

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,599
are not to be smiled about

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
but you have also people that don't

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,720
really know where they belong

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
like here we have finley now philly

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,080
wasn't dead

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
but then finley got a promotion philly's

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,360
not exactly sure that being a tech lead

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,120
was a promotion

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,960
because now finley feels like most of

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,960
her time is being spent in meetings

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,479
and she actually really liked to code

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,919
but being in this complex domain in this

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
creative domain

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,599
uh is is necessary for findlay because

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
she has to balance

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
the role of trying to figure out what is

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,880
the right system to build

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
versus how to build the right system

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,599
which is her

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,160
dev side and so balancing what should we

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,680
make with how should it be made

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,000
is is a part of her role

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
and you also have oakley oakley is a

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
senior dev

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
and one of the things that oprah's been

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,560
working hard on lately

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,400
is automation so working on the ci cd

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,639
pipeline making sure that you know

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,919
that when we push things to production

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
they work properly

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,240
also making sure that there's uh there's

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
an infrastructure

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
that that can be easily put up and

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
pulled down

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,960
and and all of those things so so that's

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,440
more in the

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,879
in the clear domain where where oakley

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,879
has been working with the automation

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
in the in the clear domain you also find

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,400
keon who does uh

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,919
just qa qa means akin is basically

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,879
everywhere all the time kian is

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,639
non-binary

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,839
he uses they them pronouns uh and he

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,080
loves to figure things out and actually

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,240
quite enjoys when there is a disaster

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
in some way together with parker just

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,399
because

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,880
finally i guess uh things really

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
went as badly as kian always worries

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
about it's a strange thing

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
kian worries constantly when when things

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,399
actually go bad kim

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,399
kind of likes it um also kian likes to

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
investigate things and maybe that's why

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,720
kim likes it when things are bad because

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,959
that

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,040
that means akin can run around and

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,080
figure things out what actually went

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,720
wrong

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,160
uh and and a little bit you know making

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
order out of chaos there

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,600
so let's take a look at our team so we

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,720
have parker our instant responder

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,440

and ellis our designer

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:37,519
together they are the parts of

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:40,560
bugs as a service our company

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,160
oh yeah uh sorry i

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,279

um jeff talks a lot with brad on the

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,560
phone because brad is the customer

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,240
okay so it's saturday

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,839
and today all of these people

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
are going to have a really bad day

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
so welcome to my talk i can't work like

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,560
this

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,560
and also welcome to kitty academy 2021

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
my name is patricia ellis i'm a trainer

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
and a consultant i'm a close class

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,240
programmer i've been programming now

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,160
in sql sports for about 15 years um

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,320
i did specialize in the dean of

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,519
application security

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,760
and i worked for a company that i

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,880
co-founded called terrible psych

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,920
i my first job was uh on the original

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
opera browser

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
uh where actually we were working in the

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
in the floor

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,760
uh above trolltech at the time

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,519
then i went over to to uh do some java

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,680
consulting for a little while and then

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,440
went to cisco where i made embellish

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,360
embedded child present systems also

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
using cute up there

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,040
and then i went back to making a browser

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,600
in vivaldi and

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,720
when i have time i work on a pet project

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
of mine which is making

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,600
a browser as well so i guess i have a

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,040
thing about browsers um

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,040
i have a master's degree in computer

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
science and my pronouns actually here

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
the back to our heroes

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,040
okay so keon is our kiwi

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,000
um kian is always boring

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
that is is sort of a key default state

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
of mind

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,959
where keen is always worried mostly

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
about worried about whether something is

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,440
kian's fault

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,160
um but in this case

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,360
keane's worry actually helped because

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,760
keem being worried

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,320
kean had started making all sorts of

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,800
little monitors for production

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,839
to see if weird things were going on

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,240
because keane

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
gets less worried if there's monitoring

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,519
and production

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
but this morning early on a saturday

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
morning

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
one of the monitors kicked in and it

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,160
says

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,160
data expo threshold exceeded

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,440
okay so we have an alert in production

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
kian starts looking into the logs trying

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,240
to figure out what is it that that

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,600
happened

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,320
and they do look weird so can paste the

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,800
rest of the team

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,800
on slack

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,240
i think something's wrong someone seems

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:45,279
to be pulling a lot of data off

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:50,320
of the server we might have a problem

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,320
i mean it seems like a problem

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,320
so in comes oakley who's been chilling

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,600
on the couch reading book

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,320
she takes a look at the logs and

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,959
yeah they do they they do look odd right

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,959
so

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,720
she logs into the server and has a look

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,720
around to see what's running there and

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,760
this does not look normal okay so she

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,839
thinks bailey we need an sre

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,680
eye on this bailey is

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,839
not happy because baylor is building

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,880
ikea shelves and bailey takes building

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,680
ikea shelves

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,600
very seriously following instructions is

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,720
bailey's favorite

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,760
uh but she does have a notification uh

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:41,279
on slack on at all times with sound

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:43,040
loud and she responds to the call

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,120
she catches up what's been going on and

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,839
then she says but nothing's happened

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
it's saturday everything's fine

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,639
yesterday

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,480
which is not something that makes feel

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
very good it makes bailey feel good

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
because bailey

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,120
does not like weird things happening in

00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
production

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,199
but the truth is something is off right

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,440
performance is down

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,320
and massive amounts of data is being

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,360
pulled

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,880
off the server so something's going on

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,040
we have a problem and it is unfolding as

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
we speak

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,360
so this isn't really an unknown class

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,000
a problem anymore this is clearly a

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,279
problem

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,399
in the chaotic domain we still don't

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,600
know anything

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,800
and it is unfolding so we have a problem

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
in the chaotic domain

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,000
okay so in comes parker our incident

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,399
responder

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,680
she pops in takes one look at everything

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,480
that's been going on

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,880
and then goes straight to bailey and

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
says

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,720
take the site and the server offline

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
immediately

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,160
then she helps that it's like throwing

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,519
the key and bailey and

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,839
they need to figure this stuff out

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,839
because something is seriously wrong

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,480
but our first set of heroes

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,959
have done a very important thing and

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,880
especially parker

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,320
they moved the problem from the chaotic

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,199
domain into the complex zone

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,519
they did this very simply by taking the

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,399
server offline

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
and by by do taking the server on the

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,440
site

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,240
offline they got to put a pause button

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
on the problem

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,920
it was no longer unfolding it was giving

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
them time

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,480
to have a look at the problem so we're

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
not blaming data anymore we still don't

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,759
know what was going on

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,839
we don't know what has happened but at

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,519
least we know that it has stopped

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,759
happening whatever was going on

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,279
is not currently happening so we have

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,279
some time to try to figure it out

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,360
and so our heroes manage to move the

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,639
problem from the character

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,639
into the context of me

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,160
in comes ellis our designer and

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,160
finley are technically now they are here

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,920
for a totally different reason they also

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,320
pop into slack but for something

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,519
completely different they have alerts

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,720
on the twitter account uh for for

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,680
bugs as a service and

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,759
they've been added on twitter with some

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,399
weird tweets

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:33,680
um cryptic tweets really

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:37,120
first one shows up um at 8am

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,680
says we got your data and then like are

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
you still

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,040
sleeping and then

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
bugs as a service doesn't care about

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,240
their customer it seems

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,240
very strange

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,440
the catching of finley starts to worry

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,920
that this has something to do with what

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
what is currently being uh debug what is

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,120
currently being investigated right so

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,440
she jumps in uh and tries to debug the

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,760
system on a zoom call with oakley

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,280
and they just they also paint alec to

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,039
join them because

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,839
you know something is going on we need

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,839
to figure it out

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,319
but alex is busy alex is gaming

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
and alex does not want to work on a

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,959
saturday

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:26,400
and ah

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,520
but he sees the pain right he's like ah

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
okay fine i'll come debug with you but

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840
come on

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,840
it's saturday

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,039
so they all sit down on the zoom call

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,480
all trying to to mob debug this problem

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,840
trying to figure out what is

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,840
what is going on here

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,679
meanwhile ellis is diving deep into the

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,080
twitter sphere trying to figure out

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,720
what is going on with these tweets like

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,200
does this

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,960
person or people know anything do they

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,760
actually have any data what is going on

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:11,600
um in comes brad

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,240
the customer brad is not happy

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,919
brad is having a bad saturday morning as

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,520
well

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,880
so he calls jeff our sales guy who

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,760
is trying to be chipper brad

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,000
is screaming what is going on the server

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,960
is offline we can't get any work

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,280
done what kind of terrible product are

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,000
you people making

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,640
and jeff was like oh i'm not sure it's

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
nothing

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
well let me check with the team don't

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,840
worry it's

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
we'll get it back in a jiffy

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,600
but finley oakley and alex they're still

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
sitting around trying to debug this

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,799
problem

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:58,080
uh when jeff turns up in the zoom call

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,520
and jeff is not happy on a saturday

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,160
morning either

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,880
jeff starts screaming to everyone what

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,280
is going

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,960
on i've got the client on the phone he

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,200
says the server's offline

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,679
i need info asap

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,919
suddenly nobody's doing anything anymore

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,600
all we have is a zoom call where jeff is

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,440
just screaming at everyone to do

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,360
something but nobody can do anything

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,840
because jeff is screaming and and

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,720
truth matters alex didn't want to be

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
here anyway

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,200
alex wanted to be home gaming and it's

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
not working out for alec and that was

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,000
someone screaming at him for something

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,039
that alec believes

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,720
strongly is not his fault

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,320
alex gets angry listen we're trying to

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,200
work here

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,360
be quiet leave us alone we're actually

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,039
trying to get to fix your problem but we

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,440
can't do anything as long as you're

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,960
screaming

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,880
jeff jeff is is not having it i have a

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
paying customer on the line i need

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,600
answers

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,440
now jeff thinks that solving problems is

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,880
something that you can do by yelling at

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
people

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,480
so so the idea here is that if you yell

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
more at people they will do more things

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
unfortunately that doesn't really

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,480
actually work the way that jeff thinks

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
it does

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,760
and the thing is alec is not having it

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,000
anymore he is sick and tired it's early

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,320
saturday morning he was having a good

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,120
day and now everyone is screaming and he

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
can't get his

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,840
job done and he is sick and tired of

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,919
this job

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:41,520
anyway and so he just screams right back

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,520
i can't work like this

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,080
it's clear somebody has to defuse the

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,360
situation so finley steps in

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,400
being tech lead that's sort of her role

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,440
and she takes jeff off the call and sits

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,600
down with him on a separate zoom call

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,760
ah and meanwhile that the customer is

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,080
still screaming on jeff's phone which is

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,520
making jeff like

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,840
still kind of um aggressive

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,760
uh but something now she can't

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,440
participate in the debugging anymore

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,559
because now she has to manage

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,520
uh managed jeff and and brad's feelings

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,840
because they

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,280
clearly can't handle the situation i

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
keep on screaming and yelling

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,159
meanwhile though ellis has been diving

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,640
into these tweets

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
and he's come to the conclusion that

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
they are

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,840
fake like even though we have an ongoing

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
situation with something going on with

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,440
data

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,240
these are these these people don't have

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
any data

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,400
and and it was just an accident that it

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,480
came at the same time

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,760
so basically we're not too worried about

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,760
the tweets anymore

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,440
also kehian has made some discoveries

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,640
someone we're not saying who but it was

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,960
totally alec

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,000
i committed uh the server credentials to

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,559
the open github repo

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
and but but the thing is luckily there's

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,159
no no

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,080
no sensitive uh information there

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
there's all everything that's there it's

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,240
just stuff that you could have pulled

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,799
off to scrape off the website anyway

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
so whatever these people are pulling off

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,280
the server

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,679
it's not sensitive and nobody really

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,400
cares so the situation isn't as bad as a

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,400
scene

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,120
but it's still kind of embarrassing

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
because you know

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,440
it is what it is but through this this

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,520
this process with ella's investigating

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,120
the tweets and key and looking at

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,039
at the git logs um they have discovered

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,039
what the problem is and they have moved

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,080
the problem from being in the complex

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,720
domain

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,400
into the complicated the complicated

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
domain is the perfect domain for

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,600
software developers because

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,440
now we know what to do

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,760
so we have we we have leaked data but

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
the

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
data was not sensitive so we don't

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,880
really care about that

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,000
but the intruder had access to the

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,760
server and that we don't want

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
so we move the problem into the

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,280
complicated domain but it's not finished

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
we still have stuff to do

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
but the heroes for moving moving a

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,120
problem this time

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,799
is elixir designer and key in rqx

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
so they managed to figure out what was

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,679
going on and move the problem into the

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,679
complicated

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,159
okay so back to the zoom call

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,799
finley is back together with oakley and

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,840
alec

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,240
now the problem is is at least clear

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
we know what the problem is and so

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,279
together

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,279
they discuss how it should be fixed

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,080
so they form a plan the first one isn't

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,000
really necessary but they really want to

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
remove the credits from git history

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,279
mostly because they find it embarrassing

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,919
and also because um

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,799
alec is a bit embarrassed about the

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,640
whole thing um

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,720
but they also need to bring new surveys

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
in online instance online with new

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,960
credentials and everything and bring the

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,960
site back up

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,080
so oakley alec and findlay have made a

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,159
plan

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,600
and by making that plan have basically

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,360
decided that the problem should be

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,039
solved through automation by bringing up

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,679
the site again

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,480
so they have moved the problem into the

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,480
clear domain

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,000
so our heroes this time i move the

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,200
problem down here

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,760
excellent okay so down there

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,440
we have our a new set of heroes so we

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
have oakley our senior dad who's been

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
working

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,440
with bailey our sri for a long time

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,320
before this

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
on automation and and they have they

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,039
have a system

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
for for taking down and bringing up the

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,679
site on new instances

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,440
uh and they have key in to to do their

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,400
initial testing

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,520
so they they take that they use what

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,279
they already had

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,679
and they get a new server instance

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,520
online point all the traffic towards it

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,320
bring up both the site and the server

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
online again and kian does the initial

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,720
testing

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,840
on the live website and thumbs up

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,240
bugs as the service is back you know

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,279
now now brad the customer should be

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
happy which would make

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,520
jeff the the sales guy happy again and

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,400
and that everyone can go back to having

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,600
a happy sunday or saturday

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,720
um so we had a problem in the clear

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,320
domain

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,760
but it could be solved in the clear

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,080
domain

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,080
and we moved it all the way there by

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,120
moving it from chaos to complex to

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,320
complicated and finally to clear

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,000
and we managed to fix it so our heroes

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,360
in the clear domain

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,760
managed to to bring the site back up and

00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,640
bugs the services back

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
now the thing is that this model with

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,760
these

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,159
these four domains don't really uh

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,960
reflect what we did today

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,799
because most problems start as unknowns

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,039
and then they move

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,640
so we started off with a purple problem

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,640
which is basically

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,720
saying we don't exactly know where this

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,320
problem belongs

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,159
it was only after a little bit of an

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
investigation it turns out that this

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,240
problem was

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,960
in the chaotic domain and then that's

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,360
where we

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,159
pulled in our crisis management right so

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,480
this is where

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
parker took the site offline and where

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,200
we had some time to

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,039
debug the problem in the complex domain

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,679
um once we figured out what the problem

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,120
was

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,039
we moved the problem into the

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,039
complicated domain where we could use

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,799
our engineering experience our

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,159
good practice everything that we know

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,320
how to do

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,480
i had to figure out a good plan to fix

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,159
it and ended up that the fix was

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,600
actually in the clear domain with

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,600
automation and routine

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,919
now if you look at the connection

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,799
framework how how dave snowden draws it

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,600
he draws it more like this

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,159
and so what we have here is this little

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,159
space

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
in the middle where we can put things

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,799
that are unknown

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
so this is our unknown problem in our

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,320
case we figured out that it was in the

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,000
chaotic domain we moved it into the

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,919
complex domain then into

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,039
complicated and finally into the clear

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,080
where we solved it

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,000
but any problem when it starts out

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,640
we don't know where it belongs and it

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,039
could end up in any domain

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
it's just in our case it ended up being

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,520
in the chaotic domain because it was

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,520
unfolding

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,120
so now sitting back afterwards let's do

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,520
a little bit of

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,520
a think about what happened in our

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,880
process

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,080
so i like infinity sit down have a cup

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,480
of coffee

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,760
let's do a little bit of a retrospective

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,159
you know a postmortem on this problem

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,640
what is it really that we need to learn

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,640
from this

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,799
so alex and alec ask finley who's like

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,720
what is

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,640
what is the underlying lesson here what

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
should we learn from this like how can

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
we

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,880
how can we use this to become better in

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,520
the future and um

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,039
finley don't push credits to github i

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,360
mean

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,360
you know

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
what else is now really like what what

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,480
should we learn from this because there

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,679
must be a lesson here for us

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,360
um and maybe

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,760
folks being different isn't isn't a bug

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,840
maybe that is actually the future

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,360
because what we saw here is that people

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,120
thinking differently and acting

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,120
differently in different situations

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,159
people being used to different kinds of

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,480
problems

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,360
were contributing to the problem being

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,360
moved

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,360
through the different domains to finally

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,840
ending up in a situation that we could

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,039
fix

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,840
um it it is

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,399
if you look at this this chaotic filming

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,399
people

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,559
operate in the chaotic domain who like

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,960
to to operate in the chaotic domain

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,600
they are generally decisive people

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,640
people who

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,480
walk in and kind of boss people around

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,320
and in most situations you don't like

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,520
people like that they're very annoying

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
people

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,000
but when there is an unfolding crisis

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,399
you want someone to take

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
take initiative to take some kind of

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,240
leadership

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,640
role it feels really comforting when

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,799
things are falling apart around you to

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,000
look at a person who seems to know what

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,360
they're doing

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,240
and and and oftentimes that that role

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
it's not so

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,440
important that they actually know what

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,640
they're doing as long as they can act

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,279
confidently

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,120
and and people who are used to working

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,279
in the chaotic domain they have

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,440
that that uh calmness in the crisis

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,080
where they can walk in and and look

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,200
around see what is essential right here

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,399
and now

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,720
and and and move on that information

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
so so for example a first responder who

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,000
walks up to

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,880
to someone who's been in an accident

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
looks them over

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,320
and and and thinks what is going to kill

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,840
this person first

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,960
i mean what in looking over a house full

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,960
of three-year-olds going

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,399
okay so how can we get the situation

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,000
under control

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,159
um looking at a house on fire going okay

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,919
so first of all we need to stop the fire

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
we can worry about what caused the fire

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,799
later but we have to stop the fire first

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,600
uh or stop the fire from spreading this

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
kind of

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,279
of drilling down into the essentials are

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,080
the kinds of

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,799
of uh of qualities that you need in

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,000
people who operate in the chaotic domain

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,880
um in the complex domain you have the

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,120
people who

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,399
who are creative who are out of the box

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,559
thinkers but

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,440
and and and they there's a system to the

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,600
madness but

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,760
it might seem very off the wall to

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
people looking at it it is a creative

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,880
process

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,080
it involves a lot of back and forth

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,200
trying things out

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,120
and finding things that don't work it's

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,919
not a structured process and it can

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,559
frustrate

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,279
people so much especially people who are

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,039
used to

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,279
being in the conflict in complicated

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,039
domain or in the clear domain

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,320
uh because people in the conflict a

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,600
complicated domain they

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,840
like structure they like systems like

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,840
you if you would if you look at

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,440
developers who move between the complex

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,799
and the complicated domain

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,559
people in the complex domain that's

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,200
where you make your prototypes that's

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,200
where you

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,679
try stuff out that's why you do your

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,720
first bring up just to see if it works

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,519
um whereas in the complicated domain you

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,480
you you have a plan and you follow

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,320
through

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,760
and but even though it's like if you

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,440
have a bug

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,159
that you don't know much about you might

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,320
start off in the complex domain by just

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,519
by debugging just investigating trying

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,000
to figure out what is going

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,679
on but once you know what the bug is you

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,480
move into the complicated domain where

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,279
like how

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,880
should i fix this it becomes a

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,039
well-defined problem

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,720
and people who are used to operating in

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,640
a complicated domain can be

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,240
very frustrated with people who work in

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,320
the complex domain and

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
vice versa people in the complex domain

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,000
of creative

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,039
people might feel like they're not

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,120
allowed

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,120
their creativity when people want them

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
to tell them exactly how things should

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,399
have been done

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,840
in advance and they're like i don't know

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,120
i have to try

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,600
um but probably the most frustrated

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,320
person with people in the complex domain

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,320
and maybe

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,000
also with the complicated domain are

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,960
people who are used to working in the

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,799
clear domain

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,720
these are people who are used to solving

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,320
their problems with automation

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,960
and routine and process they do not like

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,240
all of this like back and forth changing

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,760
stuff

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,840
and they definitely are not fans of

00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,640
complex people who are too much

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,559
imagination and too much creativity and

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,080
too much throwing things at the wall and

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,440
see what sticks

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,120
people in the clear don't mind don't

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,760
like that they're like

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,880
like a plan a system and and they want

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,120
uh

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,240
they want everything to be running

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,279
perfectly smoothly

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
all the time the best thing would be if

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,480
everyone would just like stop

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,279
moving for like five minutes so that

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,760
things could just work

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,640
now when it comes down to what should we

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,159
learn from this

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,679
i think kian is actually uh of a

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,159
different opinion

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,679
uh so so kian thinks that the real

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,519
lesson here is that you should never

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,159
underestimate qa

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,919
they know where all the bodies burn

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,559
because it was keon that actually

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,519
managed to dig up that someone

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,720
alec uh checked in the credentials to

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,519
get help

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,360
and and by doing that kian was managed

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,919
to move the problem from the complex

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,799
domain

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
into the complicated domain no all of

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
the devs were sitting around trying to

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,440
debug the problem but none of them

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,720
actually found wiki

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,320
found uh and and one of the special

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,399
things about qa that you might have

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,679
noticed here is keon is operating all

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,040
over the place

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,919
uh both both in the automation

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,399
uh in the clear domain and also in in

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,240
the crisis it was actually kian that

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,480
that discovered the problem in the first

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,119
place uh

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
so that parker could come in and and get

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,320
that decisiveness

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,200
uh and and uh shut down the servers

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,960
um but it was the the the investigation

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,119
that king kept on doing because

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,399
he kept on digging and some people are

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,119
like that they are just

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,320
super curious people and they just want

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,639
to know

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,480
and and that keep that digging was

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,119
actually the ones that saved the day

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,000
to actually bringing the real bug into

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,720
into the light

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,520
and making it possible to fix it and

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,440
also later for kian to test it

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,359
so so keen was the one that was kind of

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,359
running around all over the place

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,400
uh but not really getting a lot of

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,680
credit

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,280
for getting stuff done

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,200
and some people are like that they are

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,280
enablers in their teams

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
but they don't necessarily get the

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,119
recognition that they need

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,599
and they are they practice their work by

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,800
making

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,839
other people better and and some

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,560
some of those those roles are not

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,040
necessarily well recognized

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,079
fiend does not make a big deal out of

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,119
themselves

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,440
keen will will instead do got little

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,839
nuggets of information here and there

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,000
giving it to people to to then run with

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,000
it

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,160
so we have our company bugs as a service

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,160
with kian down here who is the all over

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,960
the place kind of person

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,720
uh bailey who is the one that will

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,599
structure everything to make sure it

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,160
works

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,960
to get everything in line and to make

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,400
sure it works

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,520
every day the way it should

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,839
we have parker who you know it's

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,079
it's fun to have a system and it's fun

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,320
to be creative but what is really fun is

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,480
when everything's on fire

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,880
which means that parker will be the the

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,839
inappropriate smiling person at any kind

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,480
of disaster

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,480
area but that is what parker loves to do

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,160
oakley is super happy both with

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,160
with being able to build things but also

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,520
to be working together with bailey to

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,920
to find uh good automation uh

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,280
steps to make the whole uh development

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,960
process smooth

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,960
because oakley believes pushing to

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,720
production is the best thing

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,400
so making sure that that is safe is

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,599
something that oakley really appreciates

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,680
ellis our designer now he is the

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,240
creative spirit in all of this and

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,160
totally underrated by most other people

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,160
because people don't realize that

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,320
that the creativeness that ellis brings

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,320
to the table is actually what makes bugs

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,000
as a service so popular

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,160
it is what makes uh brad the customer be

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
so angry because it actually matters

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,400
that the site is online

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,040
and that has a lot to do with alice's

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
empathy

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,800
and and how else can relate to to the

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,640
end user

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,720
um and then we have alec who

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,320
sometimes kind of misses the ball at

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,800
work but mostly because

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,760
alex might not be as challenged as she

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,440
should be

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,680
he's not having enough uh fun at work

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,640
he's not really feeling inspired these

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,640
days

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,560
that's something maybe his colleagues

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,480
could help him with

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,320
maybe he needs to be challenged more

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,200
given more responsibility

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,440
given given a chance to to use those

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,760
skills that he clearly has

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,920
uh to to grow more at work

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,359
uh and then we have finley our tech

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,160
league

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
who managed to juggle these roles of

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,880
hers

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,960
uh from being this this kind of a people

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,920
person who has to manage a team but also

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
manage

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,320
and manage the sales guy jeff

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,760
and and the customer brad and and

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,800
manage them when they uh went off

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,040
being very angry uh and

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,839
managed to pull them off the team so

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,760
that the team

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,839
actually managed to solve the problem

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,119
and sometimes that is a huge

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,599
job of being the buffer between

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,720
the anger and the people who are solving

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,640
the problem

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,400
and and finley really pulled that off

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,400
unfortunately that definitely couldn't

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,040
really participate much in the solving

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,040
of the problem

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,240
and that is the story for today it's a

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
story

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,520
about a team uh building something

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,599
together

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,720
and and solving problems as a group

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,119
and what i hope that you bring from this

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,280
is that sometimes you might look around

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,880
at your colleagues and be

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,920
annoyed you might be um maybe you're an

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,599
alec

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,359
maybe you're a little bit disgruntled

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,839
with your work but most of the time

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,800
you're just

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,640
annoyed that people are are just they

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,240
don't have proper plan

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,320
and so what i'm hoping that you will

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,720
look at this and think okay actually

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,359
all of these people participated

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,800
together

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,280
to fix the problem on a saturday morning

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,960
working from home from their couches

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,280
they managed to bring it all together

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,440
not not uh despite their differences but

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,520
because of their differences and

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,200
and that is something that i i hope that

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,280
we can all bring

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,680
bring together uh and and to see that we

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,480
even though we're different uh we can

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,440
all bring

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,320
uh our whole selves to work and by doing

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,960
that

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,520
uh we can make us our whole teams and

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,640
our whole

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,839
organizations better so

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,400
thank you so much for listening and that

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,400
is my talk

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,079
thank you very much patricia for this

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,319
for this talk

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:20,880
it seems that we have a

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:24,000
q a widget for the attendees to

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,200
to use and

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,400
also maybe we can encourage them to ask

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,200
in that chat

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,240
yes if if that's not a problem there's a

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,640
small delay

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,079
in the stream so let's give them a

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,680
moment or two

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,200
to type the questions in either the

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,200
widget or the chat and we'll

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:50,319
see so so the chat is that the

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,520
kde matrix channel

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,440
yeah the academy talks one that's the

00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:07,839
one everyone is watching

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:07,839
at right now

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
okay that chat is full of applause so

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,079
far but also

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
in the widget i see the very first

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,800
question yes from

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,520
from kai what was the name of the

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,359
underlying

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,480
model again oh kinevin framework uh so

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,119
it's it's written like significant with

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,720
a c

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,760
and a y it's a it's apparently a welsh

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,640
word uh so so

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,440
he's been working on it for i think like

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,079
10 years

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,720
uh this dave's known it's very

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,040
interesting

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,040
uh and he has lots of interesting talks

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,560
about it so i really encourage you to

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,160
to look at those

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,839
okay thanks uh i can also bring it uh

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,079
uh let's see if i can now something

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,240
actually so we can have a look so

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,359
someone already linked it in the

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,700
uh good shot yeah

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,319
thank you ipwizard

00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,520
[Music]

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,440
yeah exactly i i don't have the chat

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,960
right here so if there's that if there's

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,960
questions please read them to me

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:25,440
yeah yeah i'm i'm looking at the chat

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,440
so far mostly applause and thank yous

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:33,359
and no further questions yet

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,160
one of the things that i i found really

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,640
interesting about this model was mostly

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
this

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,839
uh this realization that people

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,560
are are used to different kinds of

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,720
problems and and

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,040
that being used to different kinds of

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,079
problems like here

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,680
uh let's see if we have these here

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,280
being used to different kinds of

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,520
problems means that you approach

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,760
problems in different ways like parker

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,960
is is a very decisive kind of

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,880
uh take charge kind of person and

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,480
and that kind of personality works

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,640
really well in a crisis

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,880
but it doesn't work very well if you're

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,560
in the middle of a creative process

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,480
if you're trying to figure out what

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,560
should we do should we do this or this

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,119
then if somebody comes in who's like

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,880
tries to decide it breaks the entire

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,400
process and you can't and you might end

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
up with a sub-optimal

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,240
solution because what you need here is

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,480
more of a facilitator like

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,280
trying to figure out get people to talk

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,000
and bring those

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,880
ideas out and spin off other people's

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
ideas to try to nail what is that

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,160
what it what is a good solution for us

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,800
um and it and and so and and when you go

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,800
into the

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,640
to the to the the complicated domain

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,160
it's more about

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,920
what is the best way to solve the

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,000
problem we don't want to be too creative

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,880
we want to follow best practices

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,960
we want to be um we want to be

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,040
structured and and and there you might

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,480
have like your test driven development

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,720
and you have like a certain

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,960
flow of things and and people there are

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,839
not too fond of the whole creative

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,839
process either

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,000
and then you know in the clear domain

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,160
where bailey is is like

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
you know it's mostly about uptime

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,960
keeping things together it's like

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,040
we don't want to have a complicated

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,040
system for anything we want to make sure

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,560
it's the push of a button and everything

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,400
just works and

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,000
and people who are used to working in

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,079
different domains have different kinds

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,160
of personalities but they're all needed

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:39,200
to make a good feature or a good product

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,000
and i think we fight too much uh without

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,040
actually realizing that we are

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,040
being different is good

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,599
okay i don't see further

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,520
questions but in case people do want to

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,599
ask you later something do you have any

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,920
contact information

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,960
you can uh you can uh reach me on

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,000
twitter uh

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,040
my my handle is here

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,160
so it's a party underscore uh

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,680
gallero uh on twitter and my dm's are

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,359
open as well

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,800
so so just uh just

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,680
ping me whenever oh uh one one question

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,839
did

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,119
came up while you were showing the

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,520
twitter handle

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,800
where would the salesperson go with

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,760
solving problems by

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,760
yelling strategy

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,359
i i think if you ask jeff

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,760
like i think jeff would say that he is

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,319
up here with alec like he's a reasonable

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,359
man

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,319
with like a reasonable plan uh but but

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,400
the truth is

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,760
he's probably more over here in the

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,480
creative domain

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,480
where he he's more but but it doesn't

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,760
really have the tools i think to

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,560
to to do the actual design so it's more

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,560
of a

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:04,319
of an instinct that you know i i want

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,680
people to stop yelling so i will yell at

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,960
other people which is

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,079
a really bad solution to a problem

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,160
um so so probably

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,839
more of a personality like parker would

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,160
have been better in that role like

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,599
being able to just be calm and like

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,280
somebody's yelling at you and you're

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,839
like yeah yeah i understand that you're

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,960
angry

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:28,079
we're looking into it you know

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,599
and not not reacting by just

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,920
turning around and yelling at somebody

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,359
else which is not really constructive

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:42,160
so yeah yeah i definitely think he said

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:45,040
he's a little bit off the chart see

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,240
okay i think that's it for the questions

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,560
uh

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:57,280
again thank you very much patricia for

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:57,280
