	By Patricia Aas

Making software products can be fraught with conflicts, where people in different roles may feel sabotaged by others. In this talk I present a model for thinking about the problems we solve and how we solve them, and using that I hope to convince you that team excellence comes from our differences, rather than in spite of them. Hopefully you'll walk away with a deeper understanding of that colleague that never writes tests, or the one that constantly complains that all you do is "make bugs".
