Description: 
	By Marco Martin
Work is starting on Kde Frameworks 6 and the Qt6 transition.
The architecture of the Plasma Shell was born in the early Qt4 era, built on top of different technologies.
The Qt4 to Qt5 transition brought for us an important technology change: Qt Quick: Plasma was redesigned to use that as its first class citizen for the GUI.
While this new port to Qt6 doesn't pose a technology change as big as the Qt4 to Qt5 port, gives us the opportunity to exploit the lessons learned in the Plasma 5 lifetime, and the possibility to refactor and simplify things in order to offer a leaner and more robust experience for users and developers alike.
The talk will briefly cover the development history of the Plasma shell in the past and will cover the current plans of architectural and API changes that will happen in Plasma 6.
