Qt for Python is the project that provides the official set of Python bindings for developing Cross platform Desktop Applications with Qt Framework using Python 3.
This talk will serve as an entry point to the planned workshop on the same topic.
The workshop will cover the basics of developing cross platform desktop applications with Python using Qt and QML.

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,280
hey everyone

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,880
this is anupam here and i'll be hosting

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,439
a small talk session on cute for python

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
cute for python is an official qt

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,560
project

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,599
which aims to provide python bindings

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,560
for cute c plus plus apis

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,880
it is composed of two components one is

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,800
pi

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,440
side and the other one is shiboken

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,360
by side is the python module that we

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,000
will be using to communicate with the

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,680
cute c plus plus apis

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,920
whereas shiboken is used to extract

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
information from c or c plus plus

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
headers

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
and generate code that will allow us to

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
bring

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,920
c or c plus projects to python

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,559
just like cute cute for python is dual

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
licensed

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,000
one is under lgpl or gpl3 and another

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,119
one is commercial

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,119
the lgpl or gpl3 license is more open

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,960
source friendly and if you need to do

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,960
some commercial application you will

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
need to opt into the commercial license

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,159
now coming to buy side it's very easy to

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
install

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,759
you either run pip install pi side 2 or

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
pip install pi set 6 depending upon the

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,119
queued version that you require

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
i will be talking about that later

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,320
buy side works with python 3.5 plus

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
pi side provides python bindings to cute

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,759
c plus plus apis

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,000
like the following from pi site2.qtqml

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,479
you can import the qt qml application

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
engine

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,960
which will basically run the qml

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
application

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
as of the latest version of pai side

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
which is by side six

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,200
bindings are available both in snake

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,520
case and camel case

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,159
developers can use either of them as per

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,159
their liking

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,399
as of now buy side is available in two

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
versions

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
one is buy side two and the other one is

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
buy side six

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
by side two provides bindings for qt

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
five point x

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,040
and pi side six provide bindings for q

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,920
for six point x

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,879
with q framework ui design can be done

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
in two ways

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,319
one is qt widgets and the other one is

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,800
qml

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,800
here we will be focusing on qml

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
qml is declarative and easy to

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,120
understand or write

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,040
the ui related logic can be written in

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
standard javascript which is pretty easy

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720
here is a very basic demo of buy side in

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,959
action

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
this is a simple pie side application

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,840
which imports the pie side

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
modules and initiates a qml application

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
engine

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
which in turn loads the main.qml file

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
the main.qml file

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,200
creates an object of the application

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
window which shows

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,200
which shows an application window and a

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
rectangle in center of the screen

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,760
this is a live demo of a buy side

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
application

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,920
this is pico wizard and the first run

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:32,159
wizard which is

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:33,440
shipped with plasma mobile on major this

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,400
is the time zone screen

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,599
you can scroll the time zones and select

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
your time zone

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,840
you can also type to filter the time

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
zones and click next to set the time

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,159
zone

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
this is the wireless network connection

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,000
screen you can click

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
and you set your password to connect to

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,040
that wi-fi network

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
this is the user creation screen you can

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
type your name

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,360
your username password which should be

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,120
digits only for plasma mobile and

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,120
click next to set your username

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,599
i will be hosting a pop session on 21st

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
june 11 utc

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
follow the official channels to know

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,000
more about joining

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,440
the box sessions and the workshop is for

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,680
beginners who wants to

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,560
get into cute development or queued for

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,560
python development

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
anyone can join the bob session who is

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,120
willing to

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,759
learn more about cube for python

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,440
the only requirement is basic python

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,320
knowledge other than that

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,120
nothing else is required and if you know

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,440
qml it's a plus

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,520
these are more or less the topics that i

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,919
want to cover on the box session

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,840
and these might change depending upon

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,720
the situation or the timings that we

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,720
have on the session

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,759
that's all for now thank you for joining

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,919
