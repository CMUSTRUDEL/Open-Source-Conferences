Snaps, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the OSS Snapcraft. Its mission: to help developers create applications easily, to simplify distribution and packaging, to improve security and updates, to boldly run where no one has run before.

Self-container applications, with reliable updates and behavior across a wide range of distributions, a friendly store, tons of users. We'd like to invite you to a presentation about snaps, the new software packaging mechanism, designed to make life easier, both for developers and users. In this session, we will show you the nuts and bolts of snaps, the snapcraft command-line tool, the surrounding ecosystem, and take you on a journey of discovery and productivity.

Engage.
