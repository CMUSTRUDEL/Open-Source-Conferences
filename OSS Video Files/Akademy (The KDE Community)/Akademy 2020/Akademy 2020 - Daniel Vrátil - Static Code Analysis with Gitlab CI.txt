Title: Akademy 2020 - Daniel VraÃÅtil - Static Code Analysis with Gitlab CI
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The migration to GitLab earlier this year has opened up a lot of new possibilities to all KDE projects. One of them is introducing custom jobs on GitLab CI. In this talk I want to show the benefits of using static analysis tools and linters to automatically check code quality, and explain how to configure GitLab CI to run those tools automatically on each pull request or as a part of regular builds.
