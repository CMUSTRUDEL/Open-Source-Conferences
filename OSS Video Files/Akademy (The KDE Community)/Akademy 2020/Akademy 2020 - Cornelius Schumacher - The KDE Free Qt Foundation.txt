Title: Akademy 2020 - Cornelius Schumacher - The KDE Free Qt Foundation
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The KDE Free Qt Foundation was established to give additional guarantees to the free software community which Qt's license didn't give. It resulted in an agreement between Trolltech, the owner of Qt, and KDE e.V., the non-profit organization representing the KDE community, which made sure that Qt would always be free software even if its owning company would change its course and stop releasing it under a free license.

The agreement was tested several times. Trolltech was bought by Nokia and Qt changed its owner several times afterwards, today being owned again by a company exclusively dedicated to Qt, The Qt Company. The agreement through the KDE Free Qt Foundation brought KDE to the negotiation table whenever license changes were decided. Balancing freedom, community, business, and corporate planning in a way beneficial to all involved parties was a challenge not easily addressed.

The question of open source business models and how companies relate to communities is still a source for much debate and different solutions are in place and explored in the industry. How did the KDE Free Qt Foundation succeed? How does it hold in comparison to what other projects chose? This presentation will answer these questions and tell the story of how the KDE Free Qt Foundation played its part in keeping Qt free.

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,880
which then is named trotec

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,000
and in 1995 they released the first

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,039
version of qt

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,640
q 0.9 and it looks like this beautiful

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
thing you know this example from the

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,480
documentation i think it probably is

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,039
still there somewhere

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
so this is 1995 and that's the story of

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,520
cute and one one

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,800
of the really innovative things um

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,520
iraq and howard did is decided on

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,079
a dual licensing business model so they

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,239
had the acute profession which was their

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,440
commercial offering for all platforms

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
and all projects

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,000
including proprietary so that's where

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
they made money from

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
and innovative thing they did is they

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
decided on

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,559
releasing acute free edition as well and

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,039
their free edition license

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,320
for software projects which were free

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,640
software

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:13,119
so free projects using free software

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,640
on x11 i've got this edition for free

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,600
the other part of the story we have to

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,119
tell is the story of kde

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
so one year later in 1996 pcs are still

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,799
a thing

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,200
windows has actually grown is there unix

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
has something called the common desktop

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
environment

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,600
cde quite an enterprise thing

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
and linux is also coming along kernel

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,680
2.0 was just released

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
and there are a number of linux

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
distributions

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
so the big ones debian red tattoos they

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,799
are already around at the time

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,560
and they are starting to becoming more

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
and more successful

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,040
but if you look at the state of the

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,040
graphical uses on linux

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,960
it's still quite sad this is how a linux

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,600
looked like not very convenient

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,399
very consistent uh quite difficult to

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,640
con

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
and certainly not made for ordinary

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
people but

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,000
for us who were using their command line

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,440
tools in this uh

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,440
window manager so this situation

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,319
obviously was something would

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,840
change and in 1996 in october made here

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,840
a german student

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
newsnet post and he asked for

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,560
programmers

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
wanted to join a project to crack create

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,519
an

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,000
actual user interface a graphical user

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,319
interface for users which was

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,720
for normal people not only the

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,920
developers

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,200
and in his first email he had actually

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,879
two firm decisions one was the stuff

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,120
will be distributed under the terms of

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
the gpl so this was the start of a free

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
software project

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,480
this was meant to be to use the

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,280
power of the many people who are around

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,959
and the other decision is that this

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
should be based on cute

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,319
because he saw cute as a very strong

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,800
technical foundation

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,120
to actually implement this somewhat

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
cleaner desktop how he calls it

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
and he also recognized georgetech's

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
business model and said yeah this kind

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
of marketing free source code for free

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,720
software that's something what i like

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
and this was actually the base which

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
actually made it possible to

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,519
develop kde on cute

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,519
so he asked for 20 30 programmers

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,840
to join um and that happened and in 1997

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,080
there was the first kde presentation at

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
the linux congress in wurzburg

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
that was an actually quite high profile

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,120
event back then

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
so quite a number of prominent people

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,879
joined there ted so was there eric

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
raymond was there there cornell was

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
there john meadowcall

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
they all talked about linux all kinds of

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,280
things all that kind of things

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,920
free software and also

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
you had a strong present so hobart was

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,159
there talking about

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
cute kali dalheimer who was one of the

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
first people

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,319
joining matthias call and one of the

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
core developers

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,000
back then he had to talk about

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,200
programming on linux

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
and mathias himself he talked about kde

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,239
and showed the first screenshot of kde

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,799
at this stage so this is a screenshot on

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,199
of the

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,840
original proceedings of the congress

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,919
showing

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,479
kde a pre-release the current state back

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,320
then

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,960
and this also already looks missing

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,479
was a huge success so the story goes

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,600
that there is enough there was another

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,199
project

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,199
destro project which had a

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
talk planned for after the kde

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
presentation and after they had seen

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
what kde presented there

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040
they canceled the talk and left the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,600
conference so okay he had quite an

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
impact there

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
proceedings what matthias wrote there so

00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
sorry this is in german but that's the

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
original

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,240
and he basically said three things there

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,039
in this this section so the first one is

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
cute is the only possible solution from

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,720
a technical point of view to actually be

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
able to implement that

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,120
so they checked different things and and

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,199
all these different widgets

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,400
around there lots of different things

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,600
but not very

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,320
well developed and quite different

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
so he saw the chance to some unification

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,240
there and

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
using cued as the technically and he

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,039
also hinted at

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,560
a problem kde had and that was qt's

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,240
license so critics said

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,479
qt is not free and what's interesting is

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
to see how matthias framed it so he put

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
a

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,680
sentence there tonkin cheek um yeah we

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
created a mailing list for discussing

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
cute license so

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,960
the people who are doing the actual work

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,440
are not disturbed by these discussions

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,000
but it was a big discussion and it

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,479
followed for a couple of time after that

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
and the big question there was how free

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,639
is free

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,440
so is k is cute actually free software

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
or not

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,080
and a lot of quite influential people

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,720
from the fsf from red hat from the game

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,199
team

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
they argued that the acute free edition

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
license

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,800
doesn't fulfill the requirements of free

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
software so it wasn't the gpl but it was

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,160
a homegrown license

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,319
and it had some conditions in there

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,240
which were not compatible with what the

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,400
gpl was doing so people argued

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
qt is not free enough the intention of

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,160
course was to make it as

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
free as as it's needed for free software

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,199
but this was not accepted by everybody

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
and the other big question was what what

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,759
happens if trial tech stops developing

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,160
qt what happens if

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,560
the toolkit is discontinued if the

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,039
company goes away what happens with that

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,479
and the license didn't really allow

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,720
changing it and

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,479
further developing it so this was one of

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
the open questions the community had to

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,800
answer

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,800
and which led to quite a debate

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
and there was another threat kelly

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,039
dunham said that

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
you have to understand that in in the in

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,319
this time it was actually common that

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,919
companies would buy other companies just

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,919
to shut down projects

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,360
and one of the fears there was that

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,599
microsoft would

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
come and actually shut down cute in some

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,680
way so microsoft was in a situation back

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,199
then when it was really actively

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,720
fighting linux

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,960
so this was quite real and you can see

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,680
it

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
um this is a famous advertisement from a

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
german computer magazine

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
where microsoft actually said yeah if

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,560
you use linux you you will get mutations

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
you don't have it under control

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,240
then later in 1997 there was a

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,800
pivotal meeting in the history of kde

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,039
kde won the developer meeting in unspark

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
this was the first time all the kde

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,199
developers got together

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
and auntsberg is a small german town

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,960
there is a manufacturer of wave

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,360
filmmakers actually who was

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
using venus they had some linux fans and

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
they set up some exterminators for the

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
kde

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
developers to work on they invited them

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
to onspark

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,319
so they had the meeting there and it

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
came at a pretty delicate time

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
because two weeks before this meeting

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,039
gnome was founded

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,560
as an answer or reaction to the license

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,440
question

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
and so there was competition out there

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,800
and

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,440
uh troitek sent iric and aunt to

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,199
germany to join the meeting and um to

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
work together with the kde people and

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,479
obviously also

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,680
to discuss the the question of the

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,200
license

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,880
and you have to realize that at that

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
time trojtek was just

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,120
six employees okay he had something like

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,360
200 developers working in kde

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
so the strategy of queued worked so they

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
they got this huge community adoption

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
they got this many people who actually

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,440
used qt

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,200
and on the other hand it also worked for

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
kde strong

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
uh toolkit and sheet so they had the

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,120
discussions about how how do they deal

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
with the license question

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
and uh trolltech made a pretty bold

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,200
offer there so they said okay

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
we want to have a contract between the

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
community and the company

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
which makes sure that qt stays free

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,120
forever

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,920
so the kd people were a bit shocked by

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,080
that um they didn't expect that much

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,160
from from that but in in the end of

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,839
course that was a pretty good solution

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,399
and they went ahead with that and then

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,519
later

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,160
um in 1998 beginning of 1998

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,800
the statement of intent was signed uh by

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,760
the kde site um color matthias and the

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,959
acute side

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,920
with iraq and and they they

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,320
laid down the two main things there

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,640
which the agreement should

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,240
have and the one was to have this

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,480
foundation which makes sure

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
that the q3 edition is available and

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,760
updated

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
for free software development and the

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
second part that

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,440
if this is not happening if the company

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,680
is stopping the q3 edition

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
that it shall be released under the bsd

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
license

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,200
which would allow a lot more liberal

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640
things to do with the toolkit to

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,160
actually keep up things and we'll talk

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
about that later

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,279
so this was the agreement they had and

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
then um

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,519
trautech hired um prestigious norwegian

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,920
lawyer

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
and had to explain to them that they

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,040
actually wanted to give away something

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,880
for free and want to make sure that the

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
company doesn't have a chance to change

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
that

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
it was an interesting challenge but once

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,079
the lawyer understood that

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,000
they were ready to go and they wrote the

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:36,079
actual agreement

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,399
so how does it work um the thing is that

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:43,200
um at this time there wasn't a legal

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
entity on behalf of kde so the first

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
thing which

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,600
was happening was that kdev was founded

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,600
this happened at the end of 1997

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,600
and uh trotec tv created together this

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
foundation which is called the kde free

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,720
cube foundation

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,480
the reason to do that in a separate

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
foundation was that

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
um in the case trial tech would go

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,399
bankrupt

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
then it would get hard to get access to

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,760
the assets of

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,560
trial tech and of course the the

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,720
software queue

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480
the licenses would be an asset so they

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,160
said okay we put that into an

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,959
independent foundation so that is

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
something which

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,320
can't be taken away and the license

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640
agreement

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
which strategic gives to the kde for

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,839
cube foundation

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
gives the guarantee that the kde

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
frequent foundation can then actually do

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,279
what

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,800
is necessary to keep queued free and the

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,320
foundation is actually a very small

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
thing it only consists of two

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
representatives of

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,079
both sides and they build the board of

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
the foundation which takes it takes the

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,920
decision

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,640
and there's a twist there because kde

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,079
has a majority in case of ties

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,160
so if there is a two to two voting

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,480
then kde decides about the result which

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,399
gives kde the leverage to actually

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,440
keep the license free of qt

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,440
in case something happens

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:09,120
and the primary tool to do that

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,680
is that the license agreement says

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,440
if no major updates of qt of the q3

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,680
edition happen

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
five months then the foundation can

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,360
release

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
the acute free edition under the bsd

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
license

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,519
and the consequences of that are it

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,360
protects qt against bankruptcy takeover

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,800
and change of plans because under the

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,839
bsd license

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
you actually have the permission to use

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,639
it for

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
all kind of projects open source as well

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,959
as proprietary

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,240
so that's a very liberal license and

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,399
it also allows to build again

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,160
a new company with a similar dual

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,600
licensing business model

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
that's something which you can do with a

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
psd license you can incorporate into

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
proprietary offerings

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,399
but this wouldn't be possible with the

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,399
gpa

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,360
so then in 1998 the agreement finally is

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
signed in june

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,040
there's an announcement and this has a

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,959
nice statement in it it says

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,240
we believe the founding of the kde

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,639
frequent foundation

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,040
to be an unprecedented groundbreaking

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
step ushering in a new era of software

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
development

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,279
allowing the kde project the free

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,519
software community

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,440
all three software developers as well as

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
commercial software developers

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
to prosper in a mutually supportive

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,399
fashion

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
quite a bold statement i think it

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,519
reflects the mindset of kde and qt at

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
that time

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,040
but it's actually quite powerful and has

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,240
carried on the project and the

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
foundation over the years

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
this is the actual agreement which was

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,800
science three pages

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,760
and then a few weeks later kde 1.0 was

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,959
released

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,680
based on q1.2 and

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,959
it looked like this this is still not a

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,680
beautiful desktop

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,680
it's a great start and the project a lot

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,079
of momentum

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,399
and it evolved and over the time also

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,720
the license of qt evolved

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,639
trotec added the qpl after some time

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
which then was actually accepted as an

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,880
open source license

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,320
later they changed it to the gpl and

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
this was the point in time which

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,399
actually ended all the discussions about

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,079
if cute is free software or not

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,720
kde also evolved had major updates

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,639
and the agreement in 2004 was updated as

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,839
well to reflect the change

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,839
licensing also in the in the releases of

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,839
qt and how kde used it

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,560
also added under the gpl

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,360
in qt4 but at that time it wasn't

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,440
covered by the agreement yet

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,360
one of the challenges there with the

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,920
okay with the agreement is that

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
the question what is the q3 edition

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,720
actually is

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
the crucial question of the whole

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
agreement so what

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,760
actually means this continued what means

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
major update

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
what is part of queued what do you do

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,040
with duplicated modules and stuff like

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,720
that

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,639
also what platforms are covered by the

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
agreement um at the

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,760
writing of the agreement for example

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,440
embedded platforms

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,199
weren't around so nobody thought about

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,360
that what about windows what about

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,959
mobile phones and stuff like that also

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
what licenses are acceptable

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,320
what happens with the gpl version 3

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,639
which was relevant at some point

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,680
so this is the crucial thing which um

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,000
always needed

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,079
some discussion and debate and continues

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,600
working on the agreements to adapt it to

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,279
the current

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,920
state and then

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,920
with the discussions which are what were

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,399
happening in the kdp foundation

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,240
this actually was quite helpful to to

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,759
create this balance to balance the

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
interest between the community and the

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,800
company

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,839
the foundation gave this platform to

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
actually have these discussions

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,720
then in 2008 there was

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,160
an email to kdev by the trautec

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
management

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,480
and it said yeah trolltech is acquired

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
by nokia

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,720
so this was the moment where the

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,560
agreement was put to test this was

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,440
what the agreement was designed for and

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,720
people were actually interested what was

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,279
happening there

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,320
we are quite aware that this would be an

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
interesting situation

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,360
but in this case nokia actually went

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,519
with that in a very

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,399
responsive way so they contacted us very

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,519
early

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,959
kde was at the table um

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,519
we had meetings with the nokia

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,199
management in frankfurt um that wasn't

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,000
fun uh with where the nokia managers

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,519
visited us in our then very small office

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
with half an employee

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,560
shared with the wikimedia foundation um

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,800
and

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,600
we had about cute and kde there

00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,920
and then we had the invitation back to

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,399
the

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,400
nokia headquarter in helsinki which was

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,199
of course quite a contrast but the great

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
thing was

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,480
we discussed these things on eye level

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,480
because it was clear that

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,559
the agreement was in place um and it

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,720
would stay in place

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,240
and that we would have to talk about how

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,360
we do the best

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,839
with that for the communities

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,000
nokia also added the lgpl and there was

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,959
a third agreement to reflect the changes

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,440
and qt5 then was developed under open

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,559
governance when nokia opens queued to

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,440
actually contributions of more people

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,039
they were quite ambitious sebastian

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
nustrom who was running

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,039
the cute part of nokia at that time he

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,400
said in the keynote on the q dev days in

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,080
2009 that

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,000
they wanted to increase the reach of to

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,080
tenfold and that's something clearly you

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,080
can't do without the community outreach

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,799
so over the years more evolution nokia

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,280
of course changed plans

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,080
that's a different story digi acquired

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,640
cued

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,480
q5 was released there was the fourth

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,760
agreement reflecting the changes

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,640
then the q company was informed and

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,880
eventually

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
went public another agreement reflected

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,760
the changes there

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
that's basically the state where we are

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,440
today um

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
we have this agreement in place we are

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,919
in constructive discussions with the

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,080
cute company

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,120
and uh there's one twist in the story

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,039
which is interesting

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,240
um the agreement also was built to

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,280
prevent selling

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,039
qt to microsoft uh microsoft actually

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,080
acquired most part of nokia

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,360
in in 2013 and

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,280
this this is where acute already was in

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,200
the handhelds of dgr so

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,480
also there the agreement worked

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,960
what's the end of the story well

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
we can say mission accomplished due to

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,039
state free

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,760
acute state free across

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
multiple acquisitions um and that's what

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
the

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,360
agreement was was meant to do so this

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,039
worked

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,640
but of course this is not the end of the

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,160
story because cute are still there and

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,600
kde is still there and they have

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,559
a hopeful glory for the future

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,160
and so the agreement will be there and

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,000
serve this purpose

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,280
but there are a couple of things which

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
can be learned from it and

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,679
one is that this was really a solid

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,320
thing um it

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,440
served for more than 20 years he was

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,799
state free

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,320
and kde and q both had quite

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,960
quite good success and impact so

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,799
this certainly was a good foundation and

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,320
it worked in two ways

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,080
one was that the license guaranteed

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,640
the present freedom so once you had the

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
code under the gpl of queued and kd of

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,480
course you could do whatever you want

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
with that

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
under the conditions of the license but

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,400
only was

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
the q the code you already had and the

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,039
foundation guaranteed also something

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,840
about

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,280
the future of freedom so that the code

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,840
would be developed in an

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,440
open and free way in the future as well

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
and through the foundation you had this

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,159
mechanism

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
to foster a dialogue and this balancing

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
between community and commercial

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,320
interests

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,120
so quite quite a strong setup which

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,799
actually

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,200
keeps things free one question is

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,720
sometimes asked what about the fork if i

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
have the code under the gpa

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,760
i can just just fork it why do i need

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,400
the agreement

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
that's true but it would split the

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
community

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,600
and it also wouldn't allow that your

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,080
license business model on the fork

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,640
so the most sustainable version is to

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,080
not fork but work under the agreement

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
work under the current situation

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,640
the other question which is asked

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,640
sometimes is is this a model for other

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
projects as well so could you use that

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
in other projects

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,600
and the answer is there is a certain

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,679
type of projects

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
where this might actually be a good fit

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
so the typical use case would be

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,400
something like a single vendor project

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
where you have one company controlling

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,240
an open source project

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
and they are following some new business

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
model

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,280
and for that to work they need a cla

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,360
which gives them the rights to also

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,039
release a proprietary version

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,799
and the problem there is that this is an

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,799
asymmetric setup

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,240
so the company has more rights than the

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,320
community has

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,000
and that of course can be a demotivation

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
for people to actually participate in

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,799
this project

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,559
the kdf req foundation style setup is a

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,320
way to balance this

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,240
so that there you add something on the

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,159
other side where the community gets a

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,400
say in the future of the project

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,480
and gives some security about the

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,320
freedom of the project for the future

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,320
and this is a way to motivate actually

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,320
people to contribute because they know

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,159
it's not only the company profiting from

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,200
from that but they also give something

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,120
back and they are

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
obliged to actually do that that's what

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,880
the kd frequent foundation

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
does

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
one thing to be aware of is that this is

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,600
a complex thing um the agreement

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,760
is now 14 pages not three pages any

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
most of that is about the question what

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,640
actually forms cute how's how has less

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
developed

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,080
what what do we have to take into

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,679
account for that but that's

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,600
actually the thing you need to do and

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,960
that's the result of these fruitful

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
discussions about

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,200
um how free do we do it how is the

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,640
balance between that and how can we

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
balance the interest in a

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,760
mutually beneficial way

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
and the other thing which also is i

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
think quite important

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,120
um it takes courage to do that so it

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
takes this courage of the original

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,679
founders of trolltech

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,000
which said we give it away for free and

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,159
this is an important thing because

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
you know if it would work but it

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,720
actually did

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
so the kde free cube foundation what's

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,679
the art of it

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,200
it's the freedom it's the freedom which

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,159
is also a strong value

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
we have in kde which is driving our work

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,159
and we do that

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,080
because freedom is good for business

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,280
freedom is good for community

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,720
and freedom is good for the world and i

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,840
want to close with

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,919
a quote from the original announcement

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,480
so to prosper in a mutual

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,280
fashion this is what the kde free

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,360
compute foundation set out to do

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,480
and this is what it did and what it

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,080
still does

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,799
so that's what i wanted to tell you

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:36,240
about the kde for cute foundation

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:36,240
