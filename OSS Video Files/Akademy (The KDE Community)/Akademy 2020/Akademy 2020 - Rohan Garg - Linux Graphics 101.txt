Description: 
	The ever growing popularity of ARM devices has meant a new market for KDE products. However, unlike conventional platforms where we enjoy the stability of a well tested graphics stack, platforms based on the ARM architecture tend to be quirkier.

In this talk, Rohan will be talking about the basics of how the Linux Graphics stack works touching on how technologies such as DRM, DRI, and Mesa interact with each other and the history behind how we've come to the current Gallium design in mesa.
