00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,920
first and in the morning our

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,200
inimitable david four

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,759
was running the kf6 buff so david if you

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
would

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,840
switch on your mic and or your camera

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,840
and tell us about your kf6 buff

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,240
he's not here i see on the chat

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,840
well anyone else from the kf6 buff want

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
to jump in with a summary

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,280
i guess not take note that on the wiki

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,480
the kf6 buff does have a link to

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,640
shared notes so you can always get back

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,920
to that um

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,440
after the kf6 buff there was a licensing

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
uh buff run by andreas

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,680
hi um we had a really nice

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
really condensed licensing buff our

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,720
results are already at the mailing list

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
um at the community list mostly we

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
talked about

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
software licenses are currently in

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,840
progress changes regarding

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,959
fpdx licenses and well a lot of

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,480
stuff that is happening and even well

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
too much to talk and that buff so we

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,959
have to follow up off tomorrow

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360
mostly to talk about how to better

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,760
present the license opportunities our

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
users and developers that user kd

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
frameworks

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
by using these open source licenses

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
tomorrow at nine

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,560
all right is that nine utc or nine

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,840
utc nine utc great thank you andreas

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,760
and see you tomorrow then okay moving on

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
in room one there was going to be a kde

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,080
system

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,120
yes can tell me about kf6 well

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:42,640
tell me about kf6 please i will do that

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,799
so essentially what we did was a

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,920
continuation of last year's kf6 print

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,400
where we we talked about whether our

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,200
current frameworks policies for example

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,720
with regard to the minimum acute version

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,080
need some adaption going forward

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,840
to kf6 we talked about our current work

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,840
workboard

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,000
whether we need to apply some

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,480
reorganization to it

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,640
we talked about how we get more people

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,519
involved in the effort of putting

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,880
or bringing the our frameworks more to

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,479
kf6

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,199
and some other general topics around the

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,199
whole process

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
okay thanks nicolas

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,080
uh moving on in room one the sysadmin

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
doc buff was cancelled because somebody

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,280
dug up a fiber optic

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,199
cable and that kind of cut people off

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,520
yes the idea for uh that both was

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
going to be mainly me and bhushan and

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,320
anybody else who wants to join

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,199
and bhushan had internet problems right

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,120
then

00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,560
so uh we thought about rescheduling

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
and we didn't really find a good

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,840
uh time slot that wouldn't conflict with

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
other things we were interested in

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,039
so we will just deal with it in the

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,160
general sysadmin boss that was already

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,320
planned all right thanks

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,759
nicolas other nicholas

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,080
um okay

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
let's connect up with the kde connect

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,639
design team

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,639
and that was the buff at five utc

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,479
can you connect people yes

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,160
you again so we talked about

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,080
everybody's favorite application

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,199
kdconnect

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,680
in particular some design questions

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,919
like we have for example various

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,840
different icons used in different places

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,720
so for example we have a phone with a

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,039
kde logo like decay and the gear then we

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,600
in other places we use chest decay or

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,080
adjust the gear or a plasma logo instead

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,880
and we agreed that this is something

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,199
that should be unified we talked about

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
some design proposals that were lying

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,880
around

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,160
and how to move forward on them we

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,919
talked a bit about the

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,919
states of our mac os and windows ports

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:23,440
and our relatively new qml app and how

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,440
to move forward of all of that

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,199
okay so we're moving forward good

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
um plasma and moving forward is of

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
course

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,880
a way to discover things huh that's the

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,880
seg into plasma discover alesh

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,919
are you out there to tell us about the

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,919
discover wolf

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,560
alice is not out there anyone else from

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,360
the discover buff

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,039
i was there i can talk about it well

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,000
then hi nate

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,720
hi everybody so we had a buff about

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,759
discover

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,000
we talked about um

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,120
various ideas about discover both big

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
and small

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
one idea is to one idea that we had was

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,280
to centralize using discover

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
for all of the k new stuff content when

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,160
it happens to be installed

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,720
we discussed other back ends we

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
did a little bit of ui design and

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
discover

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
talked about some possible modifications

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,759
we might want to make

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
and there were some people from other

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
distros there we talked about some

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,599
distress-specific bugs

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
figured out how we could maybe start

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
working around those

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,120
or uh contribute upstream so

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,720
yeah it was a pretty good buff

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
all right thanks nate someday i'm gonna

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,520
have to write a discover backend for

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
freebsd

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,960
then we'll do then i can come to your

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,960
both as well

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,599
okay that was the last one for room one

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,440
for today

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,520
unless setup was something really

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,759
exciting y'all were talking about which

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,879
laptops you were using

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,120
so let's move on to room two in the

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
morning we had plasma big screen with

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,560
aditya and

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,280
marco running that aditya

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
you are my hero for big screen

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,160
but you're also not here

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
anyone else from the plasma big screen

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,199
group

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,199
if you're not available to talk

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,640
then we'll move on in room two after

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,000
noon

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,039
alberts was working on a mailing list

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,519
owner policy basically to

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,640
tidy up our mailing lists hi albert

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,680
hello

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,240
so yeah we had a discussion about uh

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,200
mailing lists basically we're trying to

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
make sure that

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
all of them are properly moderated

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,640
because

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
like our boiling list are some of them

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,000
are 20 years old right so

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
some of the moderators might have pollen

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,480
for the cracks

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
so we came with a few points that

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
i will send to the mailing list but

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,480
basically it's

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,959
making sure that all the mailing lists

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
are

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,880
properly moderated also making sure that

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
all the navel

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,160
medias have the archives moderated

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
because we have some of the old ones

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,080
which

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,279
don't have them so we will fix that

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,880
and yeah basically some

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,240
internal cleaning we need to make sure

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,959
that things are properly running

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
okay thank you albert it's good to know

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
that our

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
mailing lists and communication channels

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,080
are preserved for posterity and properly

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,720
maintained

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,760
okay moving on in room two everyone's

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
favorite application

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,160
dolphin

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,760
uh elvis hi hi everybody

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,440
so yeah we we discussed um

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,920
first um how we can use telemetry data

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,200
to

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,240
improve dolphin for instance we

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,760
we agreed to count how many people

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,440
mount network folders which is something

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,560
we need to improve

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,760
support for and on this

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,120
topic we also discussed how to

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,399
not make dolphin freeze when

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,680
our users browse such

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,600
network folders and

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:38,399
also how can we improve the terminals

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,519
generation which sometimes can be slow

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,120
and finally we briefly discussed

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,240
the status of the pocket support

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,279
in kio which is

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,880
almost ready but

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,920
needs a final round of qa by

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,040
someone who really knows the topic

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,320
which is complicated so

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,440
so far we have been unable to to find

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,360
the right person

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,399
so we were thinking maybe adam

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,760
our new project coordinator

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,440
maybe he can find the the right person

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,160
for us that's it yeah

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,160
if is it is this worth twitting about to

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,839
to search for someone who knows the

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,839
the material yeah yeah

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
all right and just as a reminder you

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,480
mentioned telemetry but telemetry in kde

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
is entirely optional

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
it's opt in and the user has to

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,839
explicitly

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,920
choose to do that yes yes

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,880
i just say that to remind people that

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,200
we're not

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,600
here to chase your data even if

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,720
okay thanks elvis thanks

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,399
there's also notes on share.kde.org if

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
you want to read up on the rest of that

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,680
dolphin buff

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,560
moving on to room three we

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
had a calm morning but in the afternoon

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,519
dan vrato

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,320
did the kde pym meeting for hours and

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,800
hours and

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:22,800
look there's volcker to be dan yep hello

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,399
um so what we discussed was

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,480
well the first thing we did we we

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,320
celebrated that the

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,880
work of our g-shock student was merged

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,240
yesterday it was really cool

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,320
yep the end-to-end sync resource

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,839
will ship with the december release

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,720
then we had andrei there from

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,959
gnupg and we looked at their current

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,959
work

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
particularly interesting there is they

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,639
are working on

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
improving the smart card support in in

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,720
cleopatra

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
uh to also cover not just the

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,600
conventional chip cards but the

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,320
um more widespread usb or nfc

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
password tokens to store your crypto

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
keys on there

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,279
which i find quite exciting uh we

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,720
briefly touched on the state of contact

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,240
on windows

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,040
and most of the time was spent on the

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,279
long-running task of untangling the

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,480
various dependencies between the

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,160
50-ish or so repositories we have

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
there has been some recent progress we

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,160
managed to get the k-duff code split up

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,930
into frameworks and dan and

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,980
worked on getting rid of two of the

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,980
[Music]

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,600
mixed purpose unclear scope repository

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,800
so

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
we are making some progress there and we

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,279
looked at specific issues

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,639
um on how to continue and and also

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,160
longer term

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,920
um looking at a sprint uh towards end of

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,240
the year to specifically move this

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,240
forward

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,160
and yeah detailed notes are uh linked in

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,680
the wiki

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,560
um if you want to know more

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
okay thanks volker remember kdev

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,600
supports sprints so we're always happy

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
to

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
have that kind of events whether they're

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,199
online or in real life

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,480
you can have cake either way

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,920
okay thanks volker uh moving on

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,959
to room four room four had a theme

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
which was weyland there was a plasma on

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,440
weyland

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,440
meeting at four in the afternoon

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,639
run by dave

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
so if dave is here or any of the other

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,160
plasma weyland

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
folk

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,720
nope yeah minion take us the phone that

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,160
is true but this is the other minion

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,240
um okay we're missing dave

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
any other wayland fans out there

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,560
at five there was a test your app on

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,880
weyland

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,240
nope i guess wayland oh there's nicholas

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,279
oh well then i go again welcome

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,279
the whale at buff we we talked about

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,639
weyland and it will fix everything

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,680
and we just need to fix it

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,079
something we talked about is kdconnect

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,600
because right now two major kdconnect

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,399
features are missing on the wayland

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
which is

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,000
clipboard synchronization and keyboard

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,560
input

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
and we have a way forward now how to

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,839
proceed and bring those features on

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,959
while end

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,079
then what we talked about is

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,000
a wayland layer shell integration which

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,160
is an hopefully technical thing that

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,279
will make the future much more

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,600
maintainable

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,519
but there's still some open questions to

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,440
be answered before we can move to that

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
and we also talked about the stability

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,880
of

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,279
weyland because right now once the whale

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,000
and compositor

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,480
for example quinn crashes it takes the

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
whole session down and we talked about

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,560
potential ways on how to avoid that

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,079
but there's not really a clear path

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,399
forward

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
something else we discussed is startup

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,920
feedback

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,759
and focus transfer so for example you

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,279
click a link in your chat application

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,880
and the browser opens

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,399
and then the browser window should be

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,519
focused but right now on the wheel and

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,720
it isn't

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,240
and that needs some extra work and

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
in terms of protocols and

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,560
implementations and

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,360
that also needs some discussion with

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,519
other folks like you know people

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,519
on how to move forward on this

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,039
okay thank you nicholas it's good to

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,039
hear that

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,240
good to hear that weyland will fix it

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,760
it me also means that i have to fix

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,839
weyland on freebsd

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,760
at some point so you know i have things

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,360
to do that's good

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,360
because as long as we have things to do

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,600
we can keep coming back together

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,880
and doing cool kde stuff this was the

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,840
end of the buff

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
wrap up session because we had four

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
rooms

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,320
and they were filled to the not quite

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
