Title: Akademy 2020 - Richard Moe Gustavsen - Native Desktop: Styling Support for QtQuick Controls 2
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	At The Qt Company we have an ongoing project in the UI team to improve the support for writing desktop applications using QtQuick Controls 2. The long term goal is to bring Controls up to the same level as, or better than, Qt Widgets in terms of available controls, API, and styling. In this talk I will present which ideas we have at The Qt Company in this area for the next few years, and the initial work done for Qt-6.0 to realize it.
