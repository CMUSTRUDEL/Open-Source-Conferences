like everyone like me who has been

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,519
around for a while we'll see that while

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,399
while it's still academy we're at home

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,920
and

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,640
not like other years where actually

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,000
we're all gathering and and sharing our

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,880
experiences together

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,079
um it's been a very special day a year

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,720
though

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,640
i think that it won't escape anyone and

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
we hope everyone is well and safe we're

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,200
doing it

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,600
like this exactly for that we can't meet

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
but

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
well there's a lot of new opportunities

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,399
that come from that

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:38,240
we we get to like not have to travel

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,120
to to somewhere to do the academy and i

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,880
think that

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,440
this is also a great opportunity so uh

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
you can share we can share all of uh our

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
academy

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,160

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,160
everyone who

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,040
wouldn't have been able to to to come

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,200

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,120
i

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
encourage everyone to uh to take part of

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
the conversations and

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
think about it not just about talks

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,200
about just about

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,800
somewhere to learn but to engage and and

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,680
and to start to

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,959
uh work with um the different people who

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,760
who make kde who are

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,839
all very well approachable and and would

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,880
like to work with you for sure

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
um remember as well that we will be

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,639
having

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,680
what we call buffs which are birds of

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,040
feather sessions

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,320
uh during the week where you will be

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,360
you will get to um collaborate and well

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,440
start working together to discuss

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,399
different uh important topics to the to

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
the community

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,680
and and come to conclusions so that good

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,680
work

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,560
can happen um

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,279
and in the end like while this is a very

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,880
new thing

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,240
we're doing as kd virtual coordination

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,160
has been in kd's core

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
since the beginning we've been always an

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,360
international community

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,519
and i think that it's uh

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,079
great that we've been able to do to put

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,480
this together especially with the

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,200
help of the organizers who have done a

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
great job

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,760
now i don't really know how this works

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,240
on virtual conferences but

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,680
give them an applause i will hope that

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,120
if you upload

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,480
at home they will feel it somehow do it

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,920
if there's a way to do an applause

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,320
virtually do it and it will be better

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
i don't really know uh you can set

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,680
yourself as tattoos

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,920
on on on big blue button maybe that's

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,560
the way to to to applaud for good but in

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,800
any case

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,920
very good work from the organizers

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,800
they've been working tirelessly

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
to make this happen

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,120
and thanks to the sponsors as well they

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,920
have

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,639
been a crucial part for this academy to

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,760
happen

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,760
um they are canonical kdap ambition the

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,880
open source project gitlab

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,740
pine64 the kid company collabora

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,990
uh froglogic good thing

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,990
[Music]

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,360
and the rota systems programmer

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
fair thanks to to all of them without

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,199
them academy would not be useful

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
also i think that it's very important to

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,279
have them over and and and

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,120
together this is what

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,240
open source and free stuff are all about

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,839
um

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,880

uh maker hobby baker and i have to add

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
that the hobby baker thing is not a

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,519
thing that started with the pandemic but

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,519
it's something that i actually did

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,079
before as well

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
and i'm also the creator and maintainer

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,160
of octoprint

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,400
and um i would now before continue

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,559
to talk about that one i i would like to

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,600

so i'm going to give this

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,039
some quick time but yeah it looks like

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,760
the majority has not heard or used it so

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,240
far

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,120
heard about or used it so far english in

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,120
the morning is tricky

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,600
okay so um yeah well um

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,120
then let's maybe explain first what

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
octoprint is in the first place so that

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,080
you know from what

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,679
direction i'm talking here today uh

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,000
octoprint is a web interface for

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,520
consumer 3d printers uh those things

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,559
that these days you actually can buy in

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,679
the hardware stores

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,720
um it's an open source project

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,440
licensed under the hplv3

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,840
currently it has something around 100

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,160
000 confirmed users worldwide i don't

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,679
know an actual number because

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,480
the usage tracking that i do is

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,200
obviously opt-in due to privacy reasons

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,200
so uh i don't know about you if you're

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,919
using it or not unless you

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
tell me about it it's written in python

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
for the backend in

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
html and css and javascript for the

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,720
front-end and you can find all about it

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,919
on octoprint.org and i wrote this thing

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,480
out of uh yeah an old and own personal

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,919
itch to scratch because back in 2012 i

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,080
got myself my first

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,679
own 3d printer and found myself in a

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
situation that it was now taking up

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,080
space

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,640
in my office and producing fumes and

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,640
noises and all that and that was not

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,160
yeah that great to sit next to while

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,480
hacking on stuff so

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,559
i uh yeah i wanted a way to control it

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,000
remotely and this is when i sat down

00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,360
over my christmas break and started

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,520
working on octoprint we are now looking

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,400
at almost eight years of history of this

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,840
project

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,640
and the popularity

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,480
was actually big enough that back in

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,480
2014 so six years ago already i was able

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,120
to go full time with octoprint

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,960
back then i got hired by a company a 3d

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
printer company who

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,520
employed me to work full time on moving

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,160
octoprint forward

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,760
then in april 2016 i had to switch to

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
crowdfunding because they ran out of

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,400
money

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,120
and um yeah so it has been

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
a wild ride so to speak and it has been

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,960
quite the adventure

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,320
uh over the course of uh all these eight

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
years you see there have been a lot of

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,679
releases which are these little

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,200
um yeah green markers there

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,600
uh there have has been a lot of

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,280
improvement around octo

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,559
around the the the um yeah the

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,640
big infrastructure and all that and um

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,480
yeah so it's it has been really an

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,360
exciting time

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
and i learned a lot about uh things in

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,760
the meantime

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,960
and um uh yeah i want to talk to

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,200
today a bit about um

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,200
yeah about the experiences that i had or

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,919
rather the the lessons that i took from

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
them

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
so what it is like what it is like to

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
run an open source project for eight

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
years

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:30,960
of your life um six of those full-time

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,280
and um also how it is to run an

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
end-user facing piece of software for so

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,480
long because

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,360
yeah octoprint is actually more uh

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,280
targeting

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,679
your your run-of-the-mill 3d printer

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,520
user and those are not necessarily

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,919
developers and i'll also talk about that

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,039
a bit later and what that means for

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,640
what what indications that has

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,360
so um yeah and i'm going to talk

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,039
about um the good the bad and the ugly

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,600
that i experienced so

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:03,840
uh let's dive right in i guess and start

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,840
with the good um

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,520
so obviously when you're working on your

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
own software

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,280
project this long on your own open

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,600
source project for this long

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,360
it is your project what does this mean

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,600
well it means you can shape it

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,200
it's it's your vision that you implement

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,039
you do not have to

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
trust anyone else to make decisions for

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,039
you you do not have

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,880
to give away control and all that and

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,320
you do not have to face what i would

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
like to call politics driven

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
architecture

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,480
which is something that i experienced

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
within my former life as a corporate

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,480
software engineer

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,440
where uh technical and architecture

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,360
decisions are

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,200
are made based on internal department

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,360
politics sometimes

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
and not on what is the best choice for

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,919
this particular

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,000
uh problem that we are facing here and

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
also very important obviously is you

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
work on something that you'd

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,039
uh you work on something that you

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,919
actually use yourself and that you enjoy

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,960
using yourself

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,440
and i have right next to me here i have

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,039
like two printers that uh yet that would

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,480
be up and running if i was not giving

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,840
this talk right now

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
i also have a laser cutter back there

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,679
that runs the octoprint as well

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,440
and yeah so i use my own software daily

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
or more or less daily and this is a

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,720
really really great feeling

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,640
and this is something that makes

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
working on an open source project even

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,559
for that long

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,159
very very enjoyable another thing that

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,280
makes it very very enjoyable

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,960
is the fact that you help people so this

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,000
is also something that i really really

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,600
enjoy

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and that i've come to cherish as as

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,880
a really important part of my day-to-day

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,960
life

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,480
um is people have problems

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,679
and you you you help them you have to

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
help them solve their problems you

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,240
enable them to overcome their problems

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,880
by providing them with a solution and

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,320
sometimes

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,320
they even say thank you uh you i i get

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,159
the occasional email here and there or

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,280
just a tweet in the morning or something

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,880
like that that just

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,400
says thank you and that that makes yeah

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,520
all of the bad and actually we will be

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,799
talking about later so much worth it

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,000
um i i have gotten a lot of feedback

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,000
over the years and

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,039
and one of the most funny ones that i

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
ever got was

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,320
a a a guy who messaged me and told me

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,200
that i saved his marriage because

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,000
um he was spending so much time with his

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,919
printer in his

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
garage all the time because he had to

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,720
babysit it basically

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,559
and the wife and the kids were not

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,600
amused and then he installed octoprint

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,760
and then he could

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,200
get back into spending time with them

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,080
and just sneakily

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,960
keeping an eye on his print uh while

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,080
while doing that

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,440
so yay that's not something you hear

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,360
every uh every day and especially not in

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:56,320
in non-open source work i think right

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,480
and another thing that is very very dear

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,000
to my heart and a huge advantage of

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
working on an open source project for

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
this long

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,320
or even just working on open source in

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,559
general is you learn

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,000
tons of new stuff so i'm not just

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,360
talking about software development

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,279
itself obviously

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,200
my coding skills have increased ever

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,960
since i started working on octoprint i

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
constantly learn new libraries i

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,559
constantly

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,720
learn new tricks up my sleeve i learn

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,240
more python i get more

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,919
more proficient in this stuff but

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,200
when you run a project like this you

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
also need to learn about project

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,159
management

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,520
you need to learn about community

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
management and how to manage your

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
communities expectations how to give

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,200
them

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,279
a forum a platform to exchange things

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,200
exchange ideas exchange solutions help

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,760
each other stuff like this you have to

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
learn about release management so

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,840
it's not just that you throw code in a

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
git repository and people then pull it

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,320
in and everything is fine and dandy and

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,640
works but

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,360
at some point you will realize that some

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,039
yeah at some

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,960
after some growth of your project you

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,360
really need to

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,919
put out stable reliable builds that you

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,200
can reproduce and stuff like this

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,840
so yeah that is uh

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,279
that is all that comes with running such

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
an open source project

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,799
and talking about release management you

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,320
also learn the value of release

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,039
candidates when you suddenly find

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
yourself in

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,640
on a saturday morning trying to

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,640
frantically fix a buck in the stable

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,760
release you pushed out on friday

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,520
um and you also learn how

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,039
how bloody tricky it can be to get

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
people to actually run release

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,080
candidates

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,120
which comes back to community management

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,520
where you

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,039
need to try to incentivize people to

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,559
help you run the project

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,480
because you can't do everything on your

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,480
own and

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,400
yeah in case of octoprint there was also

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,360
a bit of brand development involved so i

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
need to find

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,720
a funny little logo i need some

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,400
corporate

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,679
identity and all that so that things get

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,760
recognizable so yeah you learn

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,799
not only about software development when

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
you run such an

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,880
uh such a project and i have to say that

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,840
i really enjoy that

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,840
um if you like learning running an open

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,880
source project is like

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:15,919
a full full overdose of learning

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,840
but as i already hinted at um yeah it's

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,960
not all fine and dandy sadly

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,480
um there are also some bad things that

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,320
you will have to face when doing this

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,720
um one obvious big point

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,720
probably for most of you is the

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,640
work-life balance situation

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,520
especially if you run a project like

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,679
octoprint or even something smaller

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,799
as a side project next to your own

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,640
full-time job

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:48,000
it can become a bit much it can become

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,000
really hard to shut off and recharge

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and you really need to learn to be very

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,919
protective of your private time for

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,919
example with octoprint

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,039
you saw on the on the on the on the

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
timeline

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,919
um the first two years almost i did it

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,279
next to my own full-time job so

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,159
after 40 hours per week of regular work

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,520
i then had to uh i then also tried to

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,760
shoulder everything that i had to do

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,679
with octoprint during my after hours so

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,799
right after work on the weekends during

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
vacation

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,000
and not only was that something that

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,840
friends and family did not find

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,120
particularly funny after a while but i

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,760
also noticed it so

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,799
i noticed an a negative impact on my

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,200
health and on my

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,880
motivation as well and so this is

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,640
something that you need to always keep

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,279
an eye out in my personal experience

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,559
because

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,720
no one else will and um

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,799
yeah you need to take breaks you need to

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
make sure that you do not spend all your

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,640
time

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,799
uh all your waking time in front of a pc

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,480
and code away on your on your pet

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,600
project or on your full-time project

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,039
it it will break you long-term so if

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,640
you can do that for a while but you

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,559
should have a plan b in order to get

00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,440
away from this mode

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:04,880
um and another bad thing sadly

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,720
is pay no one likes to talk about money

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,960
but we like having it in order to be

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,039
able to pay our bills

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,080
and um yeah asking for donations

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,880
on an open source project is is still a

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,039
bit tough

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,399
you it always feels a bit weird so here

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,880
is something for free but also please

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,399
give me money don't ask me what that was

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,200
what kind of discussion that was with my

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,279
tax consultant um

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,360
and it also usually doesn't scale so

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,880
usually what you get

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,120
when you ask for donations on an open

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
source project will not be enough to pay

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,640
the rent

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,559
uh it's it's more like beer money as

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,480
some people would call it

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,520
and thankfully uh i found

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,480
that um yeah with octoprint i i faced

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,520
this situation back in 2016

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
that i had to go donation based and and

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,399
crowdfunded full-time

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,880
and um i realized that if you really

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,640
make it transparent how much work an

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,240
open source project can be and how much

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,080
work you're actually putting in

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
how much of yourself you're pouring in

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,960
so to speak

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,120
and if you have a somewhat stable

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,279
user base then it can actually work and

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,640
in my case so far

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,279
it is working um

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,279
and it's definitely working better

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,720
target targeting i feel a bit

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,480
bad using this work but targeting end

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,240
users rather than

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,399
companies in my experience weirdly

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,840
because yeah companies always have this

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,240
capitalistic approach of

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,919
what do i get back in return and the

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
software that you're using wise that is

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,799
applicable to everything a

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
single project out there but it worked

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,960
for octoprint and its target audience

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,799
is you really should make it easy for

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
people to give you tiny butt recurring

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,679
tips

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
so do not ask for a please give me a

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
one-time payment of

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,960
20 or 50 or 100 or something but rather

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,080
make it possible for them to give you

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,320
one dollar per month

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,720
or something like this because if you

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,520
get 2 000 or 3 000 people doing that it

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,520
quickly gets

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,200
up and um in order to do that you should

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,919
also offer them

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,279
yeah there are various ways to do so so

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,279
we have these days we have github

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,399
sponsors there's patreon which is

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,600
still what what octoprint primarily gets

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,039
funded with

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,919
there's librarypay there is um

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,399
donor box there is paypal obviously for

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,399
one

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,679
one-time payments at least in germany

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,039
only you can do one-time

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,799
payments unless you have a business

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,520
account

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,919
let's not dive into these details but

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
still

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,520
um yeah it's a bit you you should give

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,640
them

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,320
choice uh because if people do not like

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,520
patreon and you only

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,960
allow patreon then yeah well then you

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,080
won't get this donation so yeah that has

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,159
been my experience

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:57,360
in that regard and the final bad

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,120
thing solitude um

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,960
especially at the start of your project

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,200
you will be doing it alone and in the

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,080
case of octoprint funnily enough i still

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,559
mostly do it alone and the thing is that

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,200
people

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
are really fast to request features but

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,360
slow to contribute them

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,080
so um it's easy to say hey it would be

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,159
great if

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,159
octoprint also did this and that but

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,519
actually making it do that and not only

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,880
making it do that once

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,640
but then keeping that functionality

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,080
maintained through the years that

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,840
is hard or at least it is trickier or

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,960
more work than just saying hey would be

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,440
nice

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:39,120
um and um

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,080
yeah so uh the thing is

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,840
um from my personal experiences you

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,080
should make it easy for people to help

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,720
you but without having to then maintain

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,760
whatever they edit so something like a

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,679
plug-in system can

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,679
go a long long way here

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,440
all right and now while we are talking

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,399
about the bad things let's go to the

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,640
ugly things

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:06,880
and yeah there are sadly some

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,120
um entitlemented attacks

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,360
this is something that i fear a lot of

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,519
you have seen in the open source space

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,720
you have users that want something

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
immediately done and

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,360
who treat you a bit like that like their

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,840
personal slave or something like this

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,840
people shaming you for pushing a release

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,600
because it contained a bug

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,320
and yes these are all things that i've

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,320
actually heard

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,559
people who outright insult you and i do

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,840
not want to talk

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,200
i do not want to collect examples of all

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,399
of this here

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,240
but yeah

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,080
the problem is people like this can

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,120
really ruin your day as an open source

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,120
developer and

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,519
the important thing to to remember here

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,480
at all times is really

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,039
yes those are vocal uh and they can ruin

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,880
your day

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,440
but the the the silent majority

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,320
who is happy with using what you put out

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,039
and who's

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,760
grateful for what for the work you do is

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,720
there

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,320
and they may be silent but they are

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,600
definitely the majority

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,679
and this is just something that you have

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,080
to keep in mind and

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,880
what you also have to keep in mind is in

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,279
my opinion

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
a lot of people will tell you well uh

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,000
this is just

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,080
yeah this is just like it is in open

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
source and you just have to grow a thick

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,760
skin as a maintainer and i

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,760
do not agree with this i have to say i

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,159
think we should just as maintainers we

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,640
should

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,679
say nope this is a boundary that i'm not

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
allowing you to cross

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,600
and um and

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,960
the other thing that you might face is

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,000
license violations

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,000
some companies stealing your code and um

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,120
and all you you're just thinking that

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,120
maybe some company stole your code

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,320
and um yeah this is something that feels

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,399
really really bad

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,080
i have not had definitely happened that

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,600
i have not definitely sorry my english

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,200
is just confused right now

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,279
i haven't definitely have that happen

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,280
with octoprints so far but i've had some

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,720
cases where i suspected that

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,159
someone was using my software internally

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,520
in their product without

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,240
actually adhering to the license

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,159
and the the thing is i could have tried

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,720
to to figure that out i could have

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,520
tried to drag them into a legal battle

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,919
over this

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,599
got myself a lawyer pay the lawyer with

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,800
the limited amount of funds that i get

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,919
and all that

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,040
and try to publicly shame them something

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,879
like this but if it's

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,040
just a sneaky suspicion from my

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,119
experience

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,119
i'm not sure if it if it's always worth

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,240
that so what i'm trying to say here is

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,280
choose your battles

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,599
wisely license violations suck

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,720
license violations are something that

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,359
are really

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,800
fully against the nature of open source

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,159
but on the other hand if you're a

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,200
maintainer

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,480
if you're a loan maintainer especially

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,599
then you cannot fight all the battles

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
out there so

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,240
if you have the possibility to outsource

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,680
this to something like gplviolations.org

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,720
or something i don't know

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,119
then maybe do that but try not to get

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,480
worked up too much about this as well

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,160
from my personal experience

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,320
usually it's simply not worth it because

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,240
your product is still the popular one

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,240
and yeah so

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,800
and the final ugly side of things and

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,520
something that i guess

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,359
all of you have also faced uh one time

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,720
or another during your life is

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,320
the risk of burnout so we've seen there

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,359
is a lot of stuff that you constantly

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,440
have to learn

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,800
there's uh quite a number of things that

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,119
you have to worry about

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,960
payment uh work-life balance and all of

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,720
that and on top of this there are also

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,119
the ugly sides of things

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,760
entitled users personal attacks insults

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,680
that you have to face

00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,560
gpl violations and stuff like this and

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,000
that yeah that can really really weigh

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,960
down on you

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,640
um so burn out for open source

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,079
maintainers is a real threat

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,240
and uh i would be lying if i said i have

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,400
not faced it in the past

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,200
and what i would really recommend here

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,160
is if you do regular open source work

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,079
or just if you work in general but

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,040
especially if you do regular open source

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,520
work

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,520
really keep a close eye on your own

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,400
mental health and your own physical

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,880
health

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,079
um learn to spot warning signs of

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,680
burning out like

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,720
increased apathy or irritability

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,280
in general not feeling all there or

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,400
feeling like everything sucks and all

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,599
that because

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,359
yeah this is um this can spiral out of

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,880
control quickly and you do not want that

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,720
you do not want to burn out on your open

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,480
source project because as we saw

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,079
it is a work of passion it is something

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,520
where you help people it is something

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,880
where you learn so much so it would be a

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,680
real pity if

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,599
due to other factors you burn out on it

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,760
and cannot do it anymore

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,839
and for that is really important to know

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,480
that um

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,839
you do not own anyone anything when you

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
work on open source

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,200
you give away you work for free you're

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
helping people

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,000
for free um and this

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
is already what they are getting from

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,280
you they cannot demand from you to never

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,200
take vacation days or never have a

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,839
weekend or something like that so you

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,880
should not

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,520
either um you need to take care of

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,040
yourself

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,200
because no one else will so uh

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,480
what is really really important here is

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,640
you need to

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,560
learn to say no as an open source

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,640
maintainer no to this feature

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,880
no to this bug report and also no to

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,599
this discussion yet again about a topic

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,160
that

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,440
you've talked about endlessly or just

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,119
something that is currently

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,560
not something that you have enough

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,560
spoons to to tackle

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,760
and yeah this these are the ugly sides

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,760
the question of course is with all that

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,560
that negativity that we just talked

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,839
about

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,520
would i do it again would i go all this

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,440
would i do all this journey would i go

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,400
on this adventure again and the answer

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,240
is a

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,599
is an absolutely resounding yes um

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,119
it is a very very

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,240
wild right i have learned so much i have

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,920
so many good memories thanks to working

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,720
on octoprint and i'm still making new

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,160
ones

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,800
um it is yeah it is something that is

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,720
very

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,960
humbling but in the at the same time

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,920
also something that allows you for so

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,200
much personal

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,480
growth and also professional growth and

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,160
it is it is really rewarding as well

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,720
especially when you get these

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,920
tiny mails or tweets here and there that

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,760
say thank you

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,640
and so i would absolutely do all of this

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,480
again

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,720
i would probably change some things here

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,800
and there because i learned a lot

00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,839
which i would put a good use but i would

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,440
totally do it

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,119
again and

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,760
with that i just want to thank you for

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,760
your attention

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,040
i hope it was interesting if you have

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,480
any questions that will not be able to

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,440
cover here anymore

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,119

octoprint.org

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:28,320
slides later on and with that i just

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:31,680

workable good enough

00:45:43,200 --> 00:46:01,839
that's obviously the microphone it says

00:45:45,040 --> 00:46:01,839
and and that's why it's using microsoft

00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,839
is

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,839
about apps

all right so

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,040
let's get started and

00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:53,839

yes please everyone welcome jonathan

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,520
talking about

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,119
kde apps well kpe is all about the apps

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,040
it's been our goal for the last year

00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,680
worth checking out uh what's happening

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,200
in the last year

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,920
how we can improve it for next year

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,880
how do i control this tonight first

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,720
we're asking

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,240
reminding ourselves why we picked this

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,640
goal

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,240
last year apps were always part of the

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,720
kde story it was always part of the plan

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,119
from the

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,559
from day one where matthias and the

00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,480
other ones started it

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,240
was to create uh not just the desktop

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
but suite of applications that went with

00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,440
it

00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,240
um a suite of applications that worked

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,599
well together

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,000
looked good together had the same

00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,240
usability look and feel

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,200
and that was a great goal um and we kind

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,160
of we

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,280
achieved that along with the desktop we

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,119
achieved that within

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,359
a few years and we've improved it ever

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,400
since

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:22,079
but uh

00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,680
but the tech world moved on um turns out

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,359
somebody rejected patch from somebody

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,400
else and and then another desktop was

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,079
started and a whole bunch of other

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,559
desktops got started and that's freedom

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,720
for you

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,160
and well we never did monopolize the

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,680
world in the way that microsoft did

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,880
and that's probably not a bad thing

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,920
um so other desktops came along

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,520
other application suites came along and

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,040
other form factors came along of course

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,079
there were there were

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,280
networks and web apps and uh and

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,280
smartphones

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,160
um and uh other platforms came along

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,000
people

00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,760
either used to be people hosted on

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,559
sourceforge or kde

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,400
or a similar project but now you you

00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,200
just start your projects and get that or

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,960
github or something so there's there's

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,920
no shortage of competition for people

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,920
who want to

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,200
make a free software open source app no

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,559
shortage of places they can do it no

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,520
shortage of communities

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,520
that they can work with

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,800
and that's been that's been fabulous um

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,160
for the open source free software world

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,720
but it's meant that we've been stuck a

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,119
little bit

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,359
in our niche a little bit um a little

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,319
bit too focused on our apps being for

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,480
kde

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,079
um and even when kde became the

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,440
community and even when

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,400
uh ke became um the people

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,760
and and the the plasma brand got

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,800
separated out there was still this

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,359
mindset

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,160
both within our community and in the in

00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,240
the broader

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,880
computing world that these apps were for

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,160
kde and if you weren't using plasma then

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,880
they probably weren't that interesting

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,640
to you um and that means we missed out

00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:01,839
um and of course then the other

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,240
change uh in the computing ecosystem is

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,839
the

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,839
coming along with the app stores so

00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:09,040
we've now got app stores for

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,160
linux and both there's also apps for for

00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,079
windows and mac and

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,480
and android and maybe iphone and

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,680
because of changes in the licenses huge

00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,680
we can take advantage of this

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,720
but we've had a bit of an attitude

00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,520
problem with our with our app story

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,240
as i say we're too stuck in this mindset

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,800
not

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,920
not just us but people out there and

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,839
people within kde

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,280
and and everybody within kitty are not

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,640
playing anyone in particular with that

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,040
mindset exists

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,640
that we think our apps are for kde

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,880
because that was the original vision 20

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,680
odd years ago

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,720
even though that that restricts us to an

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,119
issue beneath

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,559
it it doesn't allow us to promote our

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,920
applications on their own

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,119
terms um and it it means that we get a

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,160
bit too much

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,839
weather to the idea that it we must be

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,520
separate from the distributions

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,960
um and we can't ship our own software

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,319
because we depended upon limits

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,440
distributions for a long time and

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,119
they've done

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,640
a big service to us and continue and

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,960
always well

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,280
but it means we haven't taken control of

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,440
our own applications too much

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,319
and we've been too scared that that map

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,400
and windows are

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,839
a bit evil and a bit not to be touched

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,599
um

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,960
and there's been i've had long and

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,200
passionate arguments with

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,000
with people within the kde community

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,520
where

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,960
we did the release of kidney

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,960
applications and

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,760
i was told not to promote the app stores

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,200
that our apps are on i was told not to

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,640
um promote the channels that we have to

00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,640
ship our apps directly because they

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,680
won't quite complete each other

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,960
um there's some bugs in it or or

00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,240
maybe we're a bit too scared of doing

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,440
the security updates or if you're too

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,800
scared of those new responsibilities

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,160
that come along with shipping your stuff

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,079
directly or we don't want to offend the

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,920
distributions or so forth and again that

00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,680
means we've we've missed the

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,839
um we've missed those opportunities

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,839
we're a bit too stuck learning

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,960
and and also the attitude exists that

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,559
packaging shouldn't be part of the

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,079
application project it can be a kd

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,200
project but it should be a separate

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,720
project and that

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,319
limits uh how it is for

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,680
for those applications to be able to

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,680
take control of their own destiny

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,160
so we picked the goal all about the apps

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:28,000
we're going to focus on market

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,119
on um on kd's applications and the way

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,040
that we have done

00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,240
for plasma and personality standalone

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,359
its own brand and it's got a lot of

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,920
recognition amongst

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,040
linux users uh that is a great product

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,680
and uh

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,599
and it brings us back to being a leading

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,000
desktop lightweight feature cool

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,680
uh simple and either powerful still

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,559
might be for powerful when needed

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,400
um but the apps in our marketing got a

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,880
bit left behind and in our

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,400
in our um in our effort to push them out

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,800
to users and and get

00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,839
grow those communities so what have we

00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,920
done last year

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,920
with kitty is all about the app school

00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,200
[Music]

00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,000
we had kitty applications as a as a name

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,920
for

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,440
uh the three monthly four monthly

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,359
release um

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,440
but then that duplicates that name that

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:19,200
branding was just a bit duplicated with

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,520
or the general concept of applications

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,040
in kde uh if you wanna talk about kde

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,640
applications which one are you talking

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,160
about so we de-branded that because it

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,920
shouldn't matter how it gets released

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,680
for for the end user even for

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,839
distributions people don't care

00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,440
who who makes those released terribles

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,720
um people care

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,960
when there's a new version i don't know

00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,720
what those features are so we de-branded

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,839
that it's now just a release service

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,280
and it dumps turbos every four months um

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,520
and it means that changes can be made

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,680
like here on the kitty.org front page

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,280
uh carl and others redesigned that to

00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,319
highlight some of our top applications

00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,000
and some of those

00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,160
are part of that bundle something or not

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
it doesn't matter what matters is that

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,280
we're promoting those now directly on

00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,599
our front page of

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,040
kde.org and you can see some of our

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,520
flagship apps here of course creator

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,720
everybody

00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,680
talks about knives wonderful contact us

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,040
um classic and beautiful and full of

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,880
potential and

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,359
okay develop is for the nerds out there

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,839
and works

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,520
great and you can see from the

00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,040
screenshot that we have these great apps

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,040
and users

00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:32,000
and also on kd.org we tied up the

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,599
applications pages uh we uh

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,359
we've now listed all the applications

00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,200
that pages made automatically

00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,559
um it's got a few bugs you can see in

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,520
there so that needs a bit of quality

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,280
assurance but

00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,799
but we download those from the metadata

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,200
files app stream and app stream

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,400
means that we can control our metadata

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,760
which is pretty

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,839
pretty basic stuff but it was a long

00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,599
time coming um where we

00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,200
say here's a description here's an icon

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,119
that goes along with it

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,240
here's a screenshot and here's when the

00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,920
releases are

00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,920
so within these application pages

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,680
um we've now changed that website or

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,599
improved that website

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,200
uh so it now has an install on linux

00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,400
button you go there on linux it says

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
install and then let's go on a different

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,079
platform

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,400
it says install on windows or whatever

00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,640
um

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,920
that's using the app stream url we were

00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,799
the first people to use that i think

00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,880
because it

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,319
it it's not even a url right so the

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,839
specification was published we had a few

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,200
pictures to make there

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,359
but then you can just click on that and

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,559
it'll open up discover or gnome software

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,359
center or whatever

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,880
open your application um and that

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,359
application will pick the best method to

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,799
install

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,839
and we as coders don't ever

00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,160
have a strong thing about what that

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,119
means to install it that's for the user

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:44,079
and the user can uh decide to put some

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,760
packages or containerized formats are

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,359
best

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,559
so you can see here on twitter

00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,319
underneath it it has

00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,079
options to install on linux and that

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,599
uses the app stream url but also on

00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,240
the microsoft store and google play

00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,040
store but you can also see further down

00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,040
it has

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,640
a release text so when there's a new

00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,920
release they can add it to that

00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,520
app stream file um that then appears on

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,480
this website and it can appear anywhere

00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,880
else that

00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,680
can automate that in such a way it also

00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
shows

00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,440
how you download uh do a direct download

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,760
of

00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,960
the files for mac os or windows or

00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,520
forget the source

00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,960
so for the first time now if someone

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,160
goes oh there's a new recent pizza out

00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,599
how do i get that

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,280
they can go to our website and they can

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,559
get it and uh

00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,000
well i'll be using this as an example

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,520
they don't project but it uses tweets as

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,960
an example because it's a flagship

00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,480
pattern does everything right

00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:40,559
um but it it nicely gives a smooth

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:43,839
experience to the user

00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:47,040
uh along with the de-branding of the

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:50,000
of the kde applications uh we did

00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,599
uh the monthly updates uh so we are

00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,520
actually doing some promotion of

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,640
our apps but what's happened in the last

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,079
month um

00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,520
one of these 200 new channel books are

00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,040
being released today those are synced

00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,680
with their release service

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,480
releases and but they're not they

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,000
include stuff

00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,839
that comes from anywhere within kde

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,599
south released

00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,680
again we've defended the idea of extra

00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,200
gear is just self-released application

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,880
it shouldn't matter how the release

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,400
happens but that matters is what the

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,960
shiny new features are

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,240
uh so we promoting digicam big new

00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,200
release 7

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,640
dolphin and not only does it promote the

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,559
application but it promotes how you

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:29,040
get those applications so it says um

00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,240
you can download this app image you can

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,839
install it from stands you can install

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,720
on windows and so forth and i've also

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,040
included their

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,240
the occasional review app stores or

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,079
interview with somebody who's working on

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,079
the app store just to promote the idea

00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:43,520
that these channels are out there

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,520
and they're a great way to get our apps

00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,119
so to review all the channels out there

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,119
and a great way to get our apps

00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,559
and with how's my time doing we've got

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,000
uh 10 minutes

00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:01,280
15 minutes you're gonna hate what's up

00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,559
what one minute to q a

00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,359
what i thought i have half an hour here

00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,000
well um so we've got the snap store here

00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,920
um

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,119
that's made by katie new on mostly our

00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,119
stuff um

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,160
but also other other people have uh

00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,599
accounts there and they've got a nice

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,720
feature we've got a tutorial

00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:22,079
uh coming up on monday and uh and

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,079
that has most of the applications in kde

00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,559
um you can see where those packages come

00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,839
from um and you can see metrics on them

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,440
uh so that's one of the nice changes

00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:33,839
that you get from the stuff so creator

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,839
has forty two thousand dollars

00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,880
you've got a load of applications there

00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,119
and that's made by uh they've got to

00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,400
talk later today so go and see that

00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,720
and in flat tub images

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,839
by nature doesn't really have a store uh

00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,760
but it

00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:59,599
a lot of applications use that as a way

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,240
to say here's a trivial way to get our

00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,520
application

01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,640
and they can take full control of that

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,119
so that's been quite popular with a

01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,119
number of them

01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,920
not just linux app stores but also

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,520
package managers on windows

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,040
chocolaty is a package manager on

01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,359
windows and

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,240
people who manage lots of windows

01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,839
machines or if they

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,079
have to be particularly nerdy they use

01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,880
that as a good way to get their software

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,319
we've got three or four applications for

01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,240
you listed here

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,920
on that store and that's a good way to

01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,799
do some more do i need to stop and

01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,799
answer some q a now

01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:38,079
if you'd like to start q a i can start

01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,079
reading you the questions

01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,319
go through what questions we got all

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,720
right so first question

01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:47,359
says in the beginning you mentioned ios

01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,680
as a possible target for apps

01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,880
there is some interest in that target in

01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:55,040
the maui project

01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,040
iirc and also in kden

01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,040
do we already have a system that could

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:04,160
be reused for ios

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,160
for example craft or is something new

01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,640
uh ios is different i don't know

01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,000
homebrew on mac os has worked quite well

01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,440
that's the desktop applications you're

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,119
asking about mobile stuff

01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,280
uh we brought homebrewer to kde so

01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,400
there's another package manager for

01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,839
mac mostly um and and that's now

01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,640
been successfully integrated into kde

01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,599
mac we've got a number of stuff made for

01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,720
mac os

01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,400
uh so we yeah we look on if you look in

01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,119
binary factory there's quite a few made

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,839
there

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,119
um and and those are still on the

01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:40,400
download pages

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,359
uh i've got a slide in here about

01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,359
that's best practice

01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,599
on apple's app store no results um

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:51,119
possibly because it just smells bad

01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,400
maybe you can't put gpr stuff there i

01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,200
don't know maybe nobody's had

01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,960
a strong interest um i i did notice that

01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,960
libreoffice was there twice so

01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,079
it must be possible to put free software

01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,280
stuff there

01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,520
and they're pretty sure it's the same on

01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,319
the on the ios iphone

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,720
app store and we've got nothing there

01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,319
but

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:12,319
there must be ways to do it um

01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,160
and yeah i'm afraid i don't know if

01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:18,079
crafts can build successfully on those

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,440
i i would yeah i don't know i'd defer to

01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,680
hannah and the others who do crafts for

01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,680
them

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,079
is there another question yes so next

01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,720
question

01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,079
is it possible to have links to android

01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,200
play store

01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:37,200
freud on the website for example

01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,599
for itinerary or kde connect

01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,520
so android play store is another store

01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,039
that we should take advantage of

01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,039
and we have a little bit

01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:52,960
we've got a dozen apps on there um

01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:54,720
and and

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,079
it's interesting because it also allows

01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,640
commercialization that allows

01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,920
for for apps to have money next to them

01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,280
if they need it

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,920
um and well it's stupidly popular of

01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,039
course

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,920
um but does need your app to be

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,599
reconfigured for mobile um

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,119
is it possible to have links in the

01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,839
store yeah i think it is i think that's

01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,839
why i showed up

01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,839
did that happen

01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,799
well yeah yeah so that on your doorway

01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,920
applications that's the link to the

01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,400
google play store

01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,400
um and i encourage anybody to who has an

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,599
app to put it into google play

01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,200
um and get that on in their app stream

01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,240
file and then up here

01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,680
but i had in in my new not quite

01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,200
success site um f droid which is a

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,280
another app store for android free

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,880
software so it goes along for my

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,280
ideals but so far we've only got two

01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,680
things there that i can find

01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,599
and it'd be great to have more things on

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:55,359
f drive

01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:58,160
here's another question yes

01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:00,799
next question is kde apps and the whole

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:04,079
linux itself i'm not so sure about that

01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:08,319
in quotes uh still are not friendly

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,319
with some graphic drivers like

01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,480
sorry not pronounced or

01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
something which makes users have to

01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,799
install lots of things

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,720
so what do developers do to fix and

01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:22,960
improve this

01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,559
uh what the developers do to fix nvidia

01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,680
did music run away in

01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:31,200
my experience um that's difficult

01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,280
of course because it's a long stack that

01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,200
graphic sits on top of and if something

01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,400
doesn't work low down

01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,039
especially within video there's a

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,160
limited match that we can do um

01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:45,520
it's um

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,720
um i on the nvidia laptop that i have i

01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,640
tend to just use the

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:54,319
the intel chip on it unfortunately and

01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,640
yeah that's one of the failures of

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,680
just the whole gnu linux ecosystem is

01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,520
that

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,880
we're not always so integrated uh all

01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,079
the way down the stack and

01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,520
it will be great improve work and

01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,960
mostly talk to the queen developers

01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,839
because they're the ones you know about

01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,839
graphics

01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,160
it's not so another question we've got a

01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:19,440
few more questions

01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,520
okay all right so

01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,319
next one as a developer how do i

01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,799
reproduce the magic of packaging

01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,440
if i need to debug packaging slash

01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:31,039
builds

01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,000
or platform specific bug issues with my

01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:37,039
app

01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:40,160
example kd android sdk helps for android

01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,079
what else is there

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,160
uh building stuff you can build a lot of

01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,520
stuff with the crafts tool which

01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,680
successfully builds on different

01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,920
platforms whenever i've

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,599
built on a different platform you have

01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,559
to have that platform with you

01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,000
or for a virtual machine so i know for

01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,319
windows you can download virtual

01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,280
machines from microsoft

01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:02,400
which run on virtualbox and those are

01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,319
free to anybody to try

01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,680
so if you're developing your app on

01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:08,720
windows then

01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,920
anybody can try that i don't know enough

01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,760
about android to know

01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,559
the equivalent systems in android but

01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,559
they should be out there

01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:23,039
all right another question

01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:26,880
does promo need to make changes in their

01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:29,280
approach to de-emphasize the bundle

01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,760
or is the rebranding successful in

01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,319
meeting that goal

01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,359
is the rebranding successful of kitty

01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,680
apps stuff

01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,880
um i don't know because that's that's up

01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,240
to the people who have seen it

01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:45,280
and and yeah okay does it make sense

01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,559
um it was i mean it's still not quite

01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,160
perfect but it's

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,680
the only thing that we the only setup

01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,880
that we could agree on

01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:56,480
um i

01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,079
it and and i'd like to think that in

01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,839
creating those monthly app updates

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,200
that we've mostly successfully moved

01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:04,480
away from the idea

01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:07,039
that uh here's here's a bundle um

01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,319
that's released today and um gone into

01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,280
the idea that it's everything that's

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,760
been released

01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,200
on this week um the other problem i have

01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,280
with those is stuff that gets

01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,520
put into distros and various forms and

01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,920
in private repositories maybe

01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,559
um and so people think they're available

01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,240
um

01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,160
even if they haven't been fully released

01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,760
to the stable one uh it's tempting to

01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,039
say oh this is out now because

01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,960
we know there are people out there using

01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,280
that and we're very

01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,200
keen in all about the apps but also with

01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,520
my neon hat on to

01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,640
make the point that stuff needs to be

01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,960
released

01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,039
from kde properly and yeah occasionally

01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,400
you get the odd maintainer who

01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,160
it works for them but so they don't want

01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,520
to make it a terrible

01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,359
or they don't want to make a release in

01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,960
a tag um

01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,480
and that's the nice thing about the kde

01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,680
community courses like if you don't want

01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,359
to do some particular part of it there's

01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,920
probably a team out there that will

01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,960
that will pick up the fact and help out

01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,240
so we can certainly

01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:02,319
do that on all about the apps um i've

01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,520
done a number of releases and the other

01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:06,960
side of that uh

01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,640
is incubators bringing stuff into

01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,319
uh into kde which is also part of the

01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,400
goal because the whole point is to make

01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:15,200
kitty an attractive ecosystem for

01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,640
an attractive place to develop your app

01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,480
so it's an important part of the goal

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,480
also is to to bring the stuff from

01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,920
outside kd into ke as part of that

01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,679
incubator process

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,679
um and we've reviewed a number of ones

01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,199
this year i think bloody stream is

01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,759
particularly interesting and fun with

01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,080
virtual

01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,279
role-playing virtual tabletop software

01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,600
dedicated to pen and

01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,960
paper role-playing games um and that's

01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,040
bringing in a whole new

01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,159
community that was there new discussion

01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,400
channels even with discord

01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:43,520
but not um who want to be part of our

01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:45,920
community and that's just great to see

01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,960
all right well we have a minute to go

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,759
and there are

01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,239
four more questions but i will ask you

01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,679
the most

01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:56,560
important question of the hour um

01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,400
who is the kde baby who is the kitty

01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,040
baby

01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,719
you want to introduce yourself just fun

01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,040
where it locked down there i was feeling

01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,560
like

01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,120
we should we should have a bit more we

01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,679
should have some home guns here and

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,359
some fine friends come along to see our

01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,319

also on monday we've got a whole bunch

01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,000
of tutorials for the different app

01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,040
stores and packaging formats

01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,360
wonderful so um catch his

01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,320

five minute break

01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:17,840
thank you

01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,360
welcome back everyone let's get started

01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,120
with our next talk which is our goal

01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:51,040
talk on consistency

01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:51,040
by nicolo nicolo the floor is yours

01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,480
hello do you hear me

01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:02,640
sad and clear good to go okay

01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:04,880
so um hello everyone i'm the consistency

01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,280
champion and first of all i'd like to

01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,560
say that i'm not a native english

01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:12,880
speaker and most importantly

01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,000
i still haven't learned how to

01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,840
consistently

01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,760
study consistency multiple times in a

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,560
row so i will get that wrong sorry about

01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,520
that

01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:26,400
so a bit of backstory here

01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,400
slides go

01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,600
[Music]

01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,239
sorry i i

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,280
these slides are quite good to show up

01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,320
so sorry about that

01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,320
just give me a second

01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,880
and try to go to the third side

01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,719
yes i can hear you

01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,760
i think my network is not going

01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:17,840
correctly um

01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:31,840
would you like me to close this lights

01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:31,840
for you

01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,159
sorry about the technical glitch

01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,159
everyone we will be back in just a

01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,840
moment

01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,480
do you hear me now is this better

01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,960
perfect

01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,120
okay sorry about that so let's try again

01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,400
uh one year ago the consistency goal was

01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,520
selected during the

01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:05,600
2019 academy in milano average army was

01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,760
invited on the stage but introduced it

01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,360
now him here again to talk about how is

01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,480
it going after one year of

01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,880
developing it with kde to be honest i'm

01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:17,600
still a bit scared but at least

01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,320
i don't have to go on stage because last

01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,000
year

01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:26,239
i was a bit embarrassed as you can see

01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,239
here now uh let's start immediately with

01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:30,480
what is consistency anyway so

01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,280
consistency here means having a single

01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,120
solution

01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,960
for a particular problem rather than

01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,320
many different ones this applies to

01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,000
application design elements

01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,520
feature implementation with site

01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,679
structure and the style

01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,679
and the kde ecosystem has a home that

01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:47,360
unfortunately often some pers

01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:49,440
from redundancy now even though

01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,120
even though i wrote the book it still

01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,080
feels a bit like jargon

01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,040
so let's see an actual example of

01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,159
consistency

01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:01,360
so um the search bar the search bar

01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:04,640
it is a trival task so

01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,520
we have different different application

01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,360
that says

01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,520
i need a search bar that sounds easy

01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,960
i'll just do my own implementation what

01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,080
could go wrong

01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:17,199
and it does go wrong so

01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,560
we we can see here that we have disabled

01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:21,040
buttons and here

01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,960
they're active we have no arrow here and

01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,840
we have an arrow here we have

01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,719
our ear no hardware we have defined as

01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:30,639
text here

01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:34,480
and then it becomes inside the text bar

01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:36,480
here the width is not filled and in here

01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,600
these are flat buttons instead of

01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,800
buttons

01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:45,199
this is a whole mess of inconsistencies

01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:47,920
so why does this happen so

01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,719
next slide okay uh we start with the

01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,880
trivet dots

01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,159
implementing a search bar there's no

01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,120
clear guideline

01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:56,239
so the hig doesn't specify how a search

01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,400
bar should be

01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,440
we have slightly different use cases a

01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,080
web browser

01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,679
a text editor and so on so we end up

01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,920
with an inconsistency

01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:10,159
now first of all how can we how can we

01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,840
avoid that from happening but first of

01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:14,080
all we talk about

01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,520
guidelines we can have some clear and

01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,600
strong human interface

01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,560
guidelines we could improve the work

01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,480
that was already done on

01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,920
hrg.kde.org the new stuff should be on

01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,880
the hrg before it lands

01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,440
if i'm implementing a new component it

01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,159
should be

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,600
defined in the hig before i actually

01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,639
land the component this is very

01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,560
important

01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,639
then we can have a clear design

01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,800
direction the vdg mainly

01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,960
should have an idea of what design we

01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,320
are moving to having mockups here is

01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,159
extremely important so for this reason

01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,600
i will have many mock-ups in this

01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,040
present presentation

01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:54,080
slides so also we need

01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,880
the to let different app developers talk

01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,880
to each other

01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,520
coordination between application is

01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:02,560
essential when we are implementing

01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:05,520
the same feature okay

01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,920
but what can we do with the

01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,560
inconsistencies that we already have

01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,520
so first of all uh we need to find them

01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,320
i'd suggest

01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,960
to discover all kde apps what i mean

01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:18,880
with this

01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:21,280
is going to the kde.org applications

01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,560
webpage going through the list of the

01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,840
whole applications

01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,080
and trying them all out this

01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,560
takes a lot of time i did this when i

01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,600
originally proposed the consistency goal

01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,800
and it really makes you have a feeling

01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,440
of what is consistent and what isn't

01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,320
it's really an exciting experience that

01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,520
i would suggest

01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:47,120
everyone would did so

01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,960
second i'd suggest to design reusable

01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,679
components

01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,280
this is something that we have done many

01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,440
multiple times

01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:57,280
implementing a simple component that's

01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,840
reusable in different places we'll see

01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,639
how we

01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,800
did we've done that finally we cannot

01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:05,920
support for non-kd application because

01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,560
most of the word is outside of kde we

01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,440
can make

01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,000
firefox gtk application and so on feel

01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,560
native

01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,440
in plasma and that greatly improve the

01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,280
consistency

01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:19,760
feel of the user so

01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,400
but anyway how does this improve kde

01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,080
anyway

01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,520
so first of all we have better software

01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,600
usability the users

01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,080
will recognize a pattern in one

01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:31,120
application and they will be able to use

01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:34,239
that pattern multiple times then we have

01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,600
a branding the user consistent visual

01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:38,960
elements will strangle

01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,440
it because one um person

01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,639
will see one application will uh and

01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,880
then we'll see another

01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,400
and they will recognize that both are

01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,520
done by the same

01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,280
person so that will help branding

01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,520
then we have less code because by

01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,000
implementing the same uh

01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,719
component that's used multiple times we

01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,360
don't have

01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,920
to implement new code each time and it's

01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
also

01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,800
easier to write apps because we can just

01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:08,000
use the reusable components that we have

01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:11,120
previously done so

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,360
sure but how did it go how how did he

01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,880
work out did he actually improve kde so

01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,600
let's start with plasma

01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,400
so plasma as a whole uh it doesn't have

01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,199
many

01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:23,920
issues regarding consistency it's mainly

01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,719
a need of trip spacing econ size and and

01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,800
so on

01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,080
when those are using inconsistently

01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,760
throughout applets

01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,280
there is work on going to fix those

01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,920
incrementally we can see

01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,639
applex margins were fixed in 5.18

01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,000
heading was

01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:40,560
introduced in 5.19 and so on

01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,840
so we can actually see now the in

01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,960
incremental updates

01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:48,239
that we have done but first of all

01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:50,719
first of all the mock-ups so

01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:52,560
these are the mock-ups done by manual i

01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,320
think they're absolutely beautiful

01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,679
and even though we are still missing a

01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,480
couple of things

01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,920
i think we really got clues to

01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,120
implementing them

01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,679
we have here the notification mock-up

01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:07,199
with the

01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:10,560
plasmoid heading that was actually

01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:13,600
implemented in 5.19 we can see it

01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,920
in a kickoff in the system tray

01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,840
in the notification and finally in the

01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,960
new widgets

01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:24,239
sidebar so this was done consist

01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:27,360
consistently throughout plasma

01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:28,000
if a theme was to change the look of the

01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,480
heading

01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,040
it would apply immediately to all these

01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,360
places

01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:37,360
the that's beautiful then

01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:41,040
consistently in applause so we had

01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:44,159
a consistent highlight item that was

01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,520
that was not used in places such as the

01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:49,040
bluetooth applet

01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,280
now it uses the headlight thanks to the

01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,520
introduction of a new component that is

01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,800
the

01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:58,800
expandable list the expandable list is

01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,800
a list where elements can be expanded so

01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,320
this was quite important because when we

01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,480
decided to do this

01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,440
we also thought is there anything that

01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:09,199
we can add

01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:12,320
to these expandable yes the comic sense

01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:15,600
was a joke uh is there anything

01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,239
that we can add to this list uh so that

01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,800
uh

01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,679
the the usability of it will be

01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,400
improvement

01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:24,960
so we actually added this button that

01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:28,239
makes the user understand that this list

01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:31,760
element is able is a able to collapse

01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:32,320
and expand so because we thought we need

01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,560
to do this

01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:37,120
consistently we also thought how can we

01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,440
improve this so that's awesome

01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,639
then we also work on the media player

01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,520
view which is now

01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:44,960
in my opinion absolutely gorgeous we

01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,080
made it consistent with

01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:51,840
our elisa application so that's

01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:55,120
very nice and what

01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:58,639
this is yes sorry what's next uh we are

01:26:55,120 --> 01:27:02,080
in working on panel econ sizes now

01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:05,679
this was absolutely not easy as it

01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:08,639
seemed it generated a lot of discussion

01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,280
and we are still working on it this is

01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,199
the

01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,520
the latest proposal that you are seeing

01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:17,280
that hopefully will be implemented

01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:20,560
soon so we're talking about plasma

01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:23,760
so we can try to see what

01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:25,840
is this situation in applications

01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,600
so first of all the application

01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,560
situation is a bit more complex there

01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,000
are currently

01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,000
two visually different types of

01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,639
application we have kiwi just ones

01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,840
and the kirigami ones editing a queue

01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:37,600
style is tough

01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,520
so it's hard to find people willing to

01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,280
make key widgets up more consistently

01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,520
with curigami components

01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,719
with there has been a lot of work on

01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,880
creating new curriculum

01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,040
application some fitting use case is not

01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,560
covered by other kd applications such as

01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,679
the dialers and recorder

01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:57,040
and so on this is mainly driven by

01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:59,280
the development effort in plasma mobile

01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,080
and some other might replace the queue

01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,719
application

01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,560
we have done coco which is image viewer

01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:08,000
algebra has a curigami version

01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:10,880
and so on there has also been a long bdg

01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,800
discussion industry a year to decide how

01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,440
tabs and view navigation should look

01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,679
like in mean views and cyber views

01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:19,040
we did eventually reach a consensus and

01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,719
we are working on

01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,480
we are now working towards a clear

01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,520
direction which is defined by

01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:28,960
this mock-up so what do we have here

01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:31,520
first of all we have a new tab look

01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,560
and then we have these these are

01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,040
technically

01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,520
tabs as well but we decided to have a

01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:40,719
different look using the highlight style

01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:43,120
because this one

01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,000
the user can add them can move them you

01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,480
can close them

01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,480
but this one are defined but the by the

01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:50,239
developer of the application the user

01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:52,719
cannot drag them around

01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,360
so they have to uh have a different

01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,000
style

01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,960
so the user can understand that they are

01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,480
different

01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:04,159
this style was actually implemented in

01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:06,480
kirigami if i get to the next slide

01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:07,360
yes as you can see here we have it at

01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,400
the bottom

01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,600
when it's in phone mode and it's

01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,639
consistent throughout

01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,760
kde applications these these are not

01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,600
mockups these are

01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,600
actual applications so

01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:26,480
we also are working on the new tab

01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:30,159
style we've added a blue line on the top

01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:33,440
and it's also important to notice that

01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:37,199
kate now uses the q style tab

01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,120
so as soon as the new tab style lands

01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:40,639
it will also be used by kid

01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:44,000
automatically so that's

01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:47,360
awesome previously kate used a

01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,880
inconsistent tab style so that's a big

01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:53,840
win for us

01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:56,480
what else um next slide

01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,719
we also made the scroll bars a bit more

01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,360
usable everywhere they now no longer

01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,239
collapse

01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:03,199
automatically they always stay there so

01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,760
you can easily

01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,679
drag them with the mouse they also have

01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,239
a separator line to clearly

01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,520
define them and most importantly this

01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:14,400
was done by

01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,159
uh this was done throughout kde

01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,600
application kirigami once

01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:20,800
and bought kiwijust ones so this was

01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,840
done consistently

01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,840
so this is great

01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,520
we've also worked on gdk

01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,159
support so now jdk application will

01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,280
follow

01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:37,120
shadows resize errors and they are not

01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,560
following the color scheme which is

01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:43,360
extremely important and most importantly

01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,800
very recently the decoration jdk

01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:48,719
application will now follow

01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,440
your decorations so the this will make

01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,679
gdk

01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,639
application feel very native and the

01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,440
user might not

01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,080
even see the difference between qt and

01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,040
jdk

01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:02,560
application so that's very uh

01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:06,239
consistency of us

01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:08,639
finally we are porting kcms

01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:11,199
that is system settings sections to

01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:14,400
curigami so we have done online accounts

01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:16,960
windows rules global shortcuts

01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,239
bluetooth has just landed and we are

01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,800
working on network

01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:22,480
manager uh the hand aim is to make

01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,560
system settings pure human

01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,000
kirigami in order for it to be

01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,280
completely consistent

01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,840
throughout it if

01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,400
that was too much stuff and you didn't

01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,719
listen

01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,679
overall how is the consistency go on

01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:38,480
going so

01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:41,120
pretty good thanks for asking many tasks

01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:45,920
in the original consistency proposal are

01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:48,080
already addressed such as the list

01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,520
highlight some other tracks are being

01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,199
actively worked upon

01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,600
some other tasks are waiting for a

01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:57,920
developer to kick in especially once

01:31:53,600 --> 01:32:00,960
related to widgets so if you

01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:03,600
are a developer who wants to help

01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,480
this one is a great way we'll see later

01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,880
how

01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,719
finally some tests are stuck as they are

01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,480
controversial from a community point of

01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:14,000
view so i didn't talk much

01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:15,600
about those so if you want to have

01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,679
consistency first of all

01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,199
thank you that's very nice of you you

01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,600
can give a look to the

01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,239
tasks that we have on the consistency

01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,800
workbook

01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:26,880
on fabricator at this link or simply by

01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,520
searching for consistency

01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,320
in fabricator you will find it and most

01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,679
importantly

01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,400
you can join the vdh vdg chat on

01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:38,080
telegram

01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:40,159
at the vdg main room or on matrix

01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,920
or you can also ping me personally on

01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,960
telegram if you don't know what to do i

01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:47,040
can help you and

01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:49,679
introduce you to the group so

01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,800
uh if you don't know do not know what to

01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:54,719
do here are some

01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:57,360
ideas first of all we need more pages

01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:58,719
you have seen the lateral new lateral

01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,520
navigation component

01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,719
this is not yet on the hig this is very

01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:05,760
important

01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,679
that it gets there soon so we also need

01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,000
to implement a sidebar component to

01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,960
using

01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,440
kiwijetsapp this is also very important

01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,040
we need

01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:16,159
to improve our new curriculum

01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:18,880
applications you can try them out

01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:20,880
reportbacks and so on we need more bug

01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,520
reports for inconsistencies so you

01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,600
should try

01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,760
many kde applications and see what's

01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,080
inconsistent throughout them

01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,760
and we also need more cooperation

01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:32,080
between application and the working

01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,880
groups and not only talk about bdg

01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,679
but often also the problem group so you

01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,080
can just

01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:39,440
pick one and get started you can write

01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:42,800
to me personally i'm

01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,880
have three times usually and this is

01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,840
pretty much it so do you have any

01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:51,600
questions

01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:53,760
in the show notes

01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,880
hi yes we have two quests we have three

01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,600
questions

01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,520
the first question is how do we convince

01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,239
developers to switch to standard

01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,400
components

01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:04,639
instead of using their own ones

01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:08,000
especially in conflicts of design

01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:10,000
or lack of features in components

01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,520
i think that the best way to commit

01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,080
developers to switch

01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,120
to a standard component is to make that

01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:18,400
component

01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:20,159
more both full so

01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,920
you need to have all the features of the

01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:25,280
program previous component

01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:27,199
so otherwise it will both not be liked

01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,159
by the developer of the application

01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:30,560
and the users and another important

01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:33,360
thing

01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,800
is for it to be pretty because often we

01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:37,920
are deceived by

01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,639
the uh the look of something and

01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:42,000
if we see that it is prettier than our

01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:46,000
current implementation

01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:49,520
we could also think that it works better

01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,600
okay we have another question

01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,880
how do you manage to strike a good

01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,679
balance between

01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,840
refreshing the visual identity of plasma

01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,159
over the ears while maintaining visual

01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:05,440
consistency with all the other

01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:09,520
trading apps this is done because

01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:12,239
in theory plasma applications

01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:12,960
don't implement their own styles but

01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,360
they follow

01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,239
a general style the key style as an

01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,800
example

01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:20,159
so by changing the queue style such as

01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,560
the tabs

01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:23,360
that change will take effect on all

01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,400
application

01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:29,040
at once such as kit as we've seen

01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:30,960
what happens sometimes is that single

01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,760
application do not follow

01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,280
this general style as kate was doing

01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,000
before the patches

01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,119
so what we need to do is both make the q

01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,840
style better and

01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:45,520
make the application follow the q style

01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,520
this is regarding key widgets

01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:52,480
okay the other question won't porting

01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,400
applications to qml of origami hurt

01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:57,920
visual consistency

01:35:54,400 --> 01:36:00,880
wrtq widgets yes

01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,440
but the problem is uh we have to do it

01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,000
anyway

01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:06,320
because we currently we you currently

01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,239
have qml curigami application

01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:11,040
we cannot just say okay let's stop

01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:13,119
developing qml kirigami because

01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,800
qml kirigami applications are strongly

01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:18,000
needed for

01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:20,719
plasma mobile and the fact is

01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,280
kirigami was meant to be convergent so

01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:25,920
applications developed for plasma mobile

01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:27,760
are to be also used on the desktop which

01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,920
means that we are supposed

01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,040
in the future to use a convergent

01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:33,840
application than

01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,560
with curigami on the desktop given that

01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,840
we

01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,199
given this we will surely have some

01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,440
inconsistency between qml and kirigami

01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:44,719
and keywidgets

01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:47,600
so we will have to address it and

01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,880
the best way is not to stop porting

01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,000
application to command

01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:55,040
kirigami but rather to try to

01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,119
choose one framework that

01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,800
we need to use and currently that

01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,159
framework is much closer

01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,679
to qmlk origami qml is not really to

01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:06,800
support our application

01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:10,400
of course but we hope that in the future

01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,679
uh it will be maybe with the strict qml

01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,080
that should be much

01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:17,440
around much less frame intensive and

01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,440
faster in qd6

01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,719
okay so our last question is which

01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:28,000
framework will be favored in the future

01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:31,760
kirigami or key widgets

01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,719
to origami cannot cover all use cases

01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,080
it's mostly a framework for converted

01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:39,040
convergent apps

01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,679
so apps that should also be used on a

01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:43,440
tablet

01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:43,920
or on a phone as an example i do not

01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,639
think

01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,400
that key develop or krita will ever be

01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:52,159
ported to kirigami because

01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:55,840
that is not what kirigami is made for

01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:57,199
however it could happen that a new

01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:00,480
framework

01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:02,480
specifically for qml desktop

01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:06,320
application could appear so there's

01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:06,320
still a bit of uncertainty in there

01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:11,520
okay thank you nicolo and we're done

01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:14,239
with the question

01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,199
it was a great talk thank you we take a

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:31,840
five minute break now

01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:31,840
thank you

01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:14,480
uh graphical the linux

01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:15,860
uh guise for for a long time

01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,679
and we don't also

01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:20,320
[Music]

01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:21,119
always have dramatic architecture

01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,679
improvements

01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:24,400
and separation of concerns so that we

01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,480
can

01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:28,239
we can create new things that couldn't

01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,920
be possible with x

01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:34,180
so over x we we can have new features

01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,280
and but with

01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:37,600
[Music]

01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:39,119
well on we have also more complexity to

01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,679
paraphrase someone

01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,880
with great powers great comes great

01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:46,320
responsibility

01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:48,840
and here uh the

01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,119
responsibility and the power rests onto

01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:54,639
the uh

01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:55,280
lower under the stack up of the stack i

01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:57,060
mean

01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:00,080
uh above the

01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:01,920
[Music]

01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,000
we don't have the x server anymore to

01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:06,880
handle things so now it's the compositor

01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,199
that does these things a lot more of of

01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:13,040
what x used to do

01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:16,480
in plasma and in plasmid queen

01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:17,040
so the goal also does not restrict

01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:20,239
itself

01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:22,320
to being on caddy software

01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:24,400
of course it's really important for kd

01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:27,440
software and projects

01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:30,159
plasma and applications but also

01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:32,159
on mobile we have some applications well

01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:35,280
i mean some uh

01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:36,400
some applications here there so that we

01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:39,920
can reuse uh

01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:44,480
uh well on the sessions

01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:47,360
also on mobile devices for plasma mobile

01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,119
and uh and also on stream because uh

01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:51,600
well is not completely

01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:52,639
stable and it's still evolving so we

01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,360
need to have uh

01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:57,040
say our interaction within the border

01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:00,480
community we have some

01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:03,520
some subjects that need to go further

01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,040
we need to push our needs and and learn

01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:08,480
and work together to

01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:09,600
ensure that wellon stays uh a nice

01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,960
platform

01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:16,320
with good standards and shared uh

01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:18,320
share the protocols and in

01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:19,599
a very important tattoo in our house is

01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,199
of course cutie

01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:26,000
so we will try to to be good with

01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:27,040
cute and cute well in particular to

01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,599
repot their

01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:31,119
bugs and participate wherever we can and

01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:34,400
it is one of the scope of

01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,400
of our the goal

01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:40,880
so far the community has been involved

01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:44,880
with mainly the queen developers

01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:47,920
many within a small group of people

01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,760
of about six these days and uh

01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:53,920
and a lot of contributions have been

01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,920
come from smaller diverse contribute

01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:58,239
a lot of contributions have come from

01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:01,440
smaller contributors punctually

01:49:58,239 --> 01:50:03,760
over the time also so we want to

01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:06,639
i want to thank them also but they

01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,639
didn't have a uh

01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:10,560
an involvement direct involvement within

01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:14,960
the group within the goal

01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,960
which is great also that things go

01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:19,440
by themselves and involved by themselves

01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,159
and just to i'm gonna make

01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:29,440
a small recap of what progress we made

01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:32,880
and and try to uh

01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:37,040
to convey how we did nice progress

01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:38,800
um in plasma 5.18

01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:40,080
in particular we had the vertical

01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,360
desktop support

01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:45,280
so it was a

01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:47,199
one of those features that was missing

01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,639
that needed to be re-implemented and we

01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:52,239
have a lot of those

01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:53,199
uh with walon and this was one of the

01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:57,280
first

01:50:53,199 --> 01:51:00,719
uh we had uh nvidia driver support

01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:04,320
uh implemented so nvidia

01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:05,040
uh with uh well on with their well on

01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,360
support

01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,800
chose a different path compared to all

01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:12,800
of those

01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:16,000
graphical gpu makers

01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:19,440
with their drivers and so we needed to

01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,320
have a particular implementation for

01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:23,440
this

01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,400
for their drivers i mean we at first the

01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,639
community want

01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:28,719
well the quick developers didn't want to

01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:32,400
have something specific for nvidia

01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:35,920
but but we in the end we we

01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:38,639
pushed a support for this driver as well

01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:40,480
because it represents a good chunk of

01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:43,520
our users

01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:46,080
anyway and so

01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,360
that was an important issue when

01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:49,920
resizing gtk

01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:50,960
three applications is well that got

01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,360
fixed then

01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,480
and a lot of small fixes but i'm trying

01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,480
just to highlight

01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:59,440
the the most visible and more important

01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,440
ones to users

01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:07,119
um in 5.19 we had

01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:07,840
uh we added the global new news that is

01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:11,679
really loved

01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:15,360
by our users that want to have a similar

01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:18,639
uh workspace as a us os6 uh

01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:21,679
kind of works play

01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:22,320
workspace roman implemented the screen

01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:27,280
rotation

01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:27,280
so so we have good screen rotation

01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:32,719
working there was a fix with carrado

01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:36,719
carrano

01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:40,320
previous to 5.19 would be uh

01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:41,840
hidden behind the the taskbar if the

01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:45,040
taskbar was on the

01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:48,080
high on top of the screen um

01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:48,880
it would be hidden behind and this got

01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:52,639
fixed

01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:53,840
the osd osd so it's over the screen

01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:55,920
display

01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,280
got fixed in particular when plugging

01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:59,920
and unplugging your screens

01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,280
so that uh instead of being on the wrong

01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,320
wrong screen or

01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:06,159
not in the corner of the screen on the

01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:07,599
corner of the screen instead of the

01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:10,000
middle uh

01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:10,000
it could

01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:18,159
well at the right position and we got

01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:22,719
spectacle iedp support

01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:22,719
igb high gp support is really

01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,880
link to well on because well that allows

01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:32,560
to have good

01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:35,360
high dp dpi uh support and so

01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,760
we need to have a good tripod there and

01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:38,880
make

01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:42,400
being able to do screenshots

01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,040
just just so at least just so that you

01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:46,400
can

01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:49,119
make good bug reports was important so

01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,599
so this gets implemented so that you can

01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:53,040
have

01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:54,159
your full resolution of the screen even

01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,679
though you are using

01:53:54,159 --> 01:54:01,599
a scale factor um in fact that

01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:02,560
19. um and in 5.19 i want you to add

01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:05,679
like this one

01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:08,880
is something that x

01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:09,440
couldn't allow us to implement is this

01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:14,400
feature

01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:14,400
here is the the

01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:23,040
here it's the uh

01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,560
the scroll speed that's the kind of

01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:27,360
feature that x couldn't

01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:29,119
allow us to implement but that will

01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,760
allow us to add

01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:32,480
intermediate things and to to treat

01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:36,080
things that

01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:38,719
that was not possible and it's thanks to

01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:39,840
this added power to the compositor that

01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,320
we can make

01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,880
such a thing so this kind of feature

01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:46,000
couldn't

01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:49,920
be uh implemented under x but

01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:51,520
we could underwent and and i expect more

01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:54,400
of those kind of features to

01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,400
appear over time

01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:59,360
uh and in 5.20 the upcoming release of

01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:02,800
plasma

01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:05,920
we will have uh in well on screencast

01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:08,000
a better screencast support i'm not too

01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:11,280
sure what the end goal is to have

01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,480
obs working but i'm not i haven't tested

01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:18,719
it myself but you could ask

01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:21,280
alex if if i'm not too

01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,840
forthcoming on on this subject at least

01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:24,159
we'll have

01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,239
windows thumbnails which are quite handy

01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:30,159
and will be working well

01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:32,080
another great feature by uh davidson was

01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:35,599
the middle piece pasting

01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:37,760
so well that was my one

01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,679
personal feature that was missing for me

01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,480
to to really be comfortable

01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:43,280
with wellon uh although it has a small

01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,360
limitation

01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:47,520
in that it doesn't work with its well

01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,520
and

01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,360
its well-known applications as of now

01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,719
great work by

01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:55,280
vlad also is the subsurface clipping so

01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:58,480
this is

01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:59,440
part of the well-known protocols and it

01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:02,239
allows

01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:03,840
the better drawing of of sub-surfaces

01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:06,320
well it's a bit complicated

01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:08,239
but what you can uh gather from here

01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:11,920
it's it's an important step

01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:14,560
towards uh better drawing on the screen

01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:16,639
and and it's really important for some

01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,960
applications in particular for instance

01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:20,239
uh

01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:21,920
firefox which on waylon relies a lot on

01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:25,280
subsurfaces

01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:28,480
and in 5.20 we also improve stability

01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,520
and uh and some some other convenience

01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:32,719
thing we did for

01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:35,440
spectacle the screenshot utility is

01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:38,159
you won't have to click on the screen to

01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:40,400
confirm when you take a screenshot

01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:42,480
so that's one of the thing one of the

01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:45,760
things that went on is kind of meeting

01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:46,400
missing we don't have a defined protocol

01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,760
for

01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:53,040
screenshot screenshotting so we added

01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:57,840
uh our own

01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:57,840
protocol through dbos to order this

01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:06,800
so and about on stream so we've been

01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:08,480
doing some work with upstream with the

01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:11,440
well-known community we

01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:13,679
are working toward proposing a way for

01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:16,080
instance to

01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,599
to restart the well on compositor

01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,119
without using the windows

01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:24,800
and and keeping its windows also working

01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:28,080
so that to improve this well to

01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:29,679
be able to recover from from a failing

01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,360
compositor for instance

01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:33,760
or for developers it will be really

01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:33,760
handy

01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,360
and such we have been participating to

01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:40,719
the well-known

01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:43,360
mailing list and uh and we have been

01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:44,480
punctually talking with q twelve

01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:47,679
developers

01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:50,800
uh uh

01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:54,960
to to test the chains and the in

01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:58,400
in iron i run out bugs

01:57:54,960 --> 01:58:01,599
um and well on

01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:05,599
is not uh is challenging

01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:08,000
well just to reiterate that the

01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,119
kind of thing that has been keeping us

01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,560
from moving

01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:15,679
faster is that the realm it's

01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:18,239
relatively complex but not complicated

01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:18,239
it's just that

01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:23,040
also we have been working with a lot of

01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:26,159
his queen and

01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:29,119
queen in some argos show

01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:29,679
in some some part of its code show its

01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:32,800
age

01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:35,520
while kde software is he

01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:37,360
has some a lot of uh has a lot of

01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:40,880
inheritance

01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:43,119
um and uh and and

01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,560
things that are hard also is working

01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:48,800
with upstream because then

01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:53,040
it's a it adds a lot of

01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:55,760
well it's necessary work but it adds to

01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,400
making this a lot of discussions and and

01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,639
so

01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:00,840
it just slows down the process on when

01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:02,960
you're involved

01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,719
so so for ins

01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,159
so a lot of times we have been

01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:08,719
implementing protocols

01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:09,760
and then later we replace our own

01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:13,119
protocols

01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:13,599
with another we have uh an example with

01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:16,400
the

01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,960
layer layer shell protocols that have

01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:21,040
been

01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:24,080
evolving now to handle

01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:27,280
plasma surfaces and taskbars so that

01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,280
it is not a specific

01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:36,080
candy protocol anymore in the future

01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:40,320
uh and uh and community wise

01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:45,040
our current group hasn't

01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:48,639
expanded much and and we are well

01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:51,679
and we are kind of uh working

01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:54,560
with them within our own group so it's

01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:55,520
it's a challenge for us to open open our

01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:57,440
group better

01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,440
so that people can jump in and know

01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:01,840
better what we have been working on

01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:03,920
and and how we can help them if they

02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,880
want to add their own efforts to the

02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,440
effort

02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:07,440
to the goal

02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:15,280
so in the future well

02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,880
let's keep going let's keep it going we

02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:19,920
need to keep

02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:22,239
improving well on support throughout the

02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:22,239
stack

02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,080
towards expanding our user base and i

02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:30,400
recommend

02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:32,960
all of you to check it out sometimes

02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:36,000
after plasma release for instance to

02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:39,599
try try a customer well on and

02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:44,159
and find out if if it meets your

02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:47,599
needs or or report some new bugs

02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:50,080
and we need to encourage contribution

02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:51,520
and in particular by keeping the

02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:55,679
community posted so i'll be

02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:58,880
working on the shortly on the

02:00:55,679 --> 02:01:00,400
plasma 520 highlight of the new features

02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,920
we implemented for

02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:07,520
far weyland and

02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:10,719
and and about contributing

02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:14,960
tomorrow has a great presentation

02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:18,800
specifically about queen and willow so

02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,800
don't miss this one if you want to get

02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:25,840
involved

02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:30,000
thanks well should be it

02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,000
so um three four questions

02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:37,599
yeah we have few questions so the first

02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:40,800
question is

02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:41,280
are you forcing us to use weyland or can

02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,719
we

02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:48,840
stick with x11 for the moment

02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:52,239
no we are not forcing them users

02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:55,599
well from

02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:59,119
well-known sessions are not as stable

02:01:55,599 --> 02:02:03,040
both of them of term of stability

02:01:59,119 --> 02:02:04,000
and features so most users should

02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:08,159
probably stick with

02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,800
x when his wedding sessions are

02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:13,040
i would say subjectively currently at

02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,920
the end of an alpha phase

02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:17,599
so it's still missing a few features and

02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:21,360
still has some

02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:24,880
instability that that could pain

02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:27,119
some users still

02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:28,880
some users could find themselves better

02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:32,719
because there is a really

02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:35,840
well-known effect of eye changiness that

02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:35,840
adds when it works

02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:42,400
okay the next question how concerned is

02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,800
current or future wayland development

02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:45,280
with

02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:46,400
certain linux gaming applications and

02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,679
frameworks

02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:52,800
example literacy wine proton

02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:55,679
native am i audible

02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,960
yeah yeah i'm just i'm not a specialist

02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,599
on the question

02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,400
well here i know we are working because

02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:02,320
there are

02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,760
specific protocols in waylon for

02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:06,400
instance to

02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,360
restrict the uh inputs so that an

02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:10,800
application can

02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:14,400
ask to get all the inputs except very

02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:14,639
rare ones like controller for instance

02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:17,599
and

02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:18,639
and let the application take over uh the

02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:20,800
graphical

02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,800
so

02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:27,199
so here i need my my queen uh

02:03:25,119 --> 02:03:30,000
fellow developers to respond to help me

02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:34,480
respond further

02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,480
but but i don't see a particular

02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,440
issue it's it's really a use case that

02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,159
we have

02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:43,040
in mind it's part of the applications we

02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:46,400
want to

02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:46,400
get working on world

02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:52,719
okay so the next question is

02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,400
how are you dealing with nvidia plus x

02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:56,800
wayland support

02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,760
i recall that getting nvidia to work

02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,679
with weyland

02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:02,490
is different from getting it to work

02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:05,360
with x wayland

02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:08,480
[Music]

02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:08,480
i'm not sure

02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:14,400
well not a specialist on the question

02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,400
but x-ray and

02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:19,760
well we support nvidia on on wayland so

02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:23,040
[Music]

02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:26,239
it might not be good to answer

02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:29,760
the qualified to answer this question

02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:32,960
it seems to me we should have uh support

02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:36,719
but uh i haven't tested that so

02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:40,960
i couldn't answer

02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:44,000
with confidence okay

02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:46,079
so we jump to the next question

02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:52,719
what do queen developers think about

02:04:46,079 --> 02:04:56,480
weyland fragmentation and weyland groups

02:04:52,719 --> 02:05:00,800
weight on fragmentation yeah

02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:03,520
well well we have to recognize that

02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,159
well on this is quite young still so

02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:07,360
there is

02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:10,000
still some and we have different

02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:11,360
communities interacting some some of

02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,880
when the

02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:16,239
uh actors are more identity towards

02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,320
embedded for instance

02:05:16,239 --> 02:05:20,079
or they want to have small screens and

02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:23,280
such so

02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:26,239
so it's part of of uh rooting out

02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:28,560
the our solutions like uh these

02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:31,440
exaggeration protocols are a better

02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,400
example where they are gradually

02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:35,280
expanding

02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:36,400
over consensus that has been building up

02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,520
over time

02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:42,970
so so

02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:44,000
in fact well i know that we are

02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:46,560
[Music]

02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,119
working toward being more compatible at

02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,560
least with

02:05:47,119 --> 02:05:50,560
applications it's easy

02:05:57,119 --> 02:06:05,840
so i'm

02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,810
yeah then i don't have much more to add

02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,320
on this subject

02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:12,400
[Music]

02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:14,880
okay uh the next question

02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:17,360
you talked about screencasting will

02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:19,920
plasma have a built-in screencast

02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:23,760
recorder on wayland or it will support

02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:23,760
existing screen casting apps

02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:31,840
it will have a existing screen scored

02:06:28,719 --> 02:06:35,760
screencast recorder uh application so

02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:39,360
what uh alex worked on is to be able to

02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:41,760
advertise uh a pipewire

02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:44,239
connection so that applications can pick

02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:47,840
up a

02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:50,880
flux uh a stream uh video stream from

02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:51,599
from the weyland compositor and and so a

02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,400
way for

02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:55,360
to expose those streams to to

02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:58,159
screencaster

02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:59,520
to to screencast and record applications

02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:03,440
that work on well on

02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,440
or with pipewire specifically

02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:10,400
okay um as we are out of time now so

02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:12,000
there are still few questions left um i

02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:15,040
would say the attendees can

02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:19,280
ask you directly right

02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:27,840
right okay thank you maevin

02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:27,840
my pleasure thank you

02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:41,840
we'll take a five minute break and then

02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:41,840
there will be final discussion

02:14:49,199 --> 02:14:55,840
we're still waiting for nicolo

02:15:18,079 --> 02:15:23,840
okay i yeah

02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:29,920
okay welcome back everyone my personal

02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:33,840
favorite final discussion

02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:37,840
is starting so we welcome our speakers

02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,840
adam chopra

02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:51,840
over to you all

02:15:56,480 --> 02:16:00,880
adam i think you need to select the icon

02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:05,840
of headset

02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:05,840
and it will ask you to join

02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,239
okay i think it should be working now i

02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:27,679
didn't know i need to

02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:31,679
reload uh everything okay so

02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:35,040
um hi everyone so uh thank you for the

02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:36,559
introductions and you've all seen nicola

02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:39,439
maven and jonathan speaking

02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:40,960
uh just a while ago but also we have

02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:43,599
lydia here the

02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,800
former president uh current vice

02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:47,519
president

02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:48,719
and what was she not involved in right

02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:52,639
so you should know

02:16:48,719 --> 02:16:56,000
all about her and also i'm here um

02:16:52,639 --> 02:16:59,359
and we'll be talking about uh kde

02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:02,479
goals the the initiative and

02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:05,840
we will be starting with questions uh

02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:06,240
um from from the audience uh right now

02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:09,599
so

02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:13,040
you can start typing them uh there

02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:15,280
and um i'll be i'll be asking everyone

02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:19,599
that will be having a nice

02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:22,639
shot but i have a small question

02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:27,200
ready for for everyone

02:17:22,639 --> 02:17:29,200
right now so maybe in one sentence

02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:31,120
what was the previous year in terms of

02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:34,160
kde goals for you

02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:37,280
let's start with jonathan hi

02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:40,240
uh can you hear me am i good um

02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:42,000
so doing the goals that it was pretty

02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:45,679
scary as i said last year still

02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,519
is kind of scary um changing

02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:49,760
trying to have a bit of a cultural shift

02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:51,120
a bit of an attitude change within kde

02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:54,319
and out with kde

02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:56,639
um it's a soft fluffy goal so it's hard

02:17:54,319 --> 02:18:00,319
to measure how that has worked

02:17:56,639 --> 02:18:02,960
um i i know as i said my talk that

02:18:00,319 --> 02:18:03,760
i i've had a number of um sort of

02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:05,599
argumentative

02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:07,519
tough discussions with people within kde

02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:09,120
trying to say no we need to

02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:11,040
be able to deploy our apps and promote

02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:13,120
how we deploy our apps um

02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:15,040
and do it within the project or give

02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:17,599
people the power to be able to do that

02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:19,840
um and so far that's happened there's

02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:22,000
still a heck of a long way to go

02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:23,359
and one of the obvious failures of of

02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,319
this goal is that i haven't been able to

02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:27,359
build too much of

02:18:24,319 --> 02:18:28,559
of a community um in the way that um

02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:30,080
i've done with other projects where you

02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:31,599
can see carl's done with the web project

02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:33,040
he did a blog post and suddenly a load

02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:33,920
of useful volunteers come along to make

02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:36,719
websites

02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:38,160
um i haven't succeeded in doing that so

02:18:36,719 --> 02:18:38,800
if you want junior jobs because a lot of

02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:41,359
this stuff is

02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:42,559
it's relatively easy to do do come along

02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:44,800
to the

02:18:42,559 --> 02:18:47,219
our channel kde all about the apps on

02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:50,989
matrix

02:18:47,219 --> 02:18:50,989
[Music]

02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,960
okay thank you jonathan maybe next uh my

02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:59,200
event the same question

02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:59,200
in one sentence how was the year

02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:04,800
yeah um it's been a bit challenging

02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:06,240
because i got into a subject that i i

02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:08,479
didn't have

02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:10,240
great knowledge about both community

02:19:08,479 --> 02:19:13,280
wise and technically

02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:15,840
i meant to to get to to

02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,200
learn about this so but it was kind of

02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:20,240
uh

02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:21,280
overachieving personal goal and within

02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:24,080
the goal

02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:24,080
it was about

02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:33,359
it's also hard to to

02:19:28,479 --> 02:19:35,920
give some momentum to give some

02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,479
consistency enough together to work

02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:39,760
together

02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:42,880
and and then to

02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:44,160
uh animate give our progress which are

02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:48,000
kind of slow and

02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:50,880
not particularly visible sometimes

02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,880
and give

02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:55,280
feedback about our progress that's

02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:57,750
something that has been

02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:59,680
a bit challenging

02:19:57,750 --> 02:20:03,040
[Music]

02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:06,640
and and given how our goal

02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:09,920
is kind of really overarching being and

02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:14,000
on the long run we we cannot expect to

02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:19,040
to give our goal a precise date

02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:19,040
anytime soon so so it's kind of of uh

02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:26,560
uh of uh long coming

02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:30,080
and and steady and kind of feels uh

02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:31,920
restricted on our own group but but we

02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,800
have been making progress and we will uh

02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:36,479
i won't and

02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:39,280
i won't i will and we will

02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:39,280
be better i think

02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:47,120
because we're still learning anyway

02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:49,840
yeah thanks maven same question nicola

02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:51,280
how was the year it was difficult but

02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:54,240
also very rewarding

02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,200
this was my very first year of strong

02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:57,920
involvement with

02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:58,960
kde and i really have to say that i

02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,240
enjoyed it

02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:02,800
so i at the beginning i didn't know how

02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:06,560
to

02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:09,439
approach the problem of goal keeping

02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,479
but i really really have to say that i'm

02:21:09,439 --> 02:21:12,800
happy that i put

02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:15,359
my effort in it and it's going pretty

02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:15,359
well i think

02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:18,720
okay thanks and we asked the champions

02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,040
but also

02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:23,040
lydia how were the goals in your opinion

02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:25,840
in the last year

02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:26,880
i think for the three new goals we've

02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:29,359
made great progress

02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:30,080
and they're doing pretty well but i'm

02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:33,040
also really

02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:34,560
happy that we haven't lost sight of the

02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:37,520
first round of goals that

02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:38,720
we had and that they're still um showing

02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:41,600
progress even

02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:43,359
today um for example the onboarding goal

02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:44,800
with the migration to get generally

02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:46,240
making it easier for people to

02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:51,120
contribute to kde

02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:52,880
that's really cool yeah i agree

02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:54,560
thanks i don't see any questions in the

02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:58,479
short notes yet

02:21:54,560 --> 02:22:02,399
but i have some some prepared

02:21:58,479 --> 02:22:05,520
so how do you think we could

02:22:02,399 --> 02:22:06,479
we could use the the same energy of the

02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:08,720
goals in

02:22:06,479 --> 02:22:11,040
in different projects or in your project

02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:12,560
the the person is who is watching this

02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,280
right now and also is involved in the

02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:15,040
community

02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,359
you're not part of the pro of the goals

02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:21,120
but maybe you can use the same

02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:24,399
form of uh of engagement that the

02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:27,439
goals have um what do you all think

02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:30,399
how how the how can the goals help

02:22:27,439 --> 02:22:31,200
the others in the community maybe

02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:33,600
starting with

02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,600
jonathan

02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,800
uh again one of our

02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:41,840
items on the to-do list and i sort of

02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,200
tried to do it in

02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:44,640
in the talk where i said here's a few

02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,600
best practice ones and krita of course

02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:48,080
everyone uses as

02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:48,720
an example because it has on its web

02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:50,000
page

02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:52,319
here's how you can download it here's

02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:55,600
the app store so you can get it in

02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:58,800
and it'll be great for every kde app to

02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:01,120
to have them on all the app stores but

02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:03,680
also to make sure that the websites

02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,160
point to those app stores and promote uh

02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:06,160
different

02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:07,520
means of getting out as is best for the

02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:09,280
user um

02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:10,800
and so we we talked last year about

02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:13,280
having a sort of

02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:13,840
a check mark or a gold standard for apps

02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,160
that

02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:17,280
that succeed in getting getting them on

02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:19,120
as many stores as possible with

02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:21,920
distribution methods as possible

02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:23,200
and up to date of course um and and

02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,640
having some sort of automated way to

02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:26,319
check that that would be awesome

02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,240
um and then we could say well there's

02:23:26,319 --> 02:23:29,760
contacts it's a fabulous app

02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:31,359
it's not much used on windows but it

02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:35,120
could be used on windows um

02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:36,560
so so let's work on getting that built

02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:38,319
on windows on the microsoft store

02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:39,600
on in chocolatey and then suddenly it

02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:40,880
gets a nice big tick

02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:42,000
i would love to be able to do that i

02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:46,319
think that's sort of the end goal of

02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:49,600
where i want to be

02:23:46,319 --> 02:24:00,240
thanks thanks jonathan um may have any

02:23:49,600 --> 02:24:04,160
opinions about that

02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:04,160
well yeah

02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:12,240
it's really about gathering momentum and

02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:16,080
and finding people to to get involved so

02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:16,640
so that's that's really applicable to a

02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:19,680
lot of

02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:22,720
domains and and a great example

02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:26,240
but uh don't have a

02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:30,960
particular better vision than that

02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:30,960
it is great to have a focus for a group

02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:35,600
yeah thanks uh nicolo how about you i

02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:38,640
think

02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:38,960
a good way we used to generate momentum

02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:42,319
and

02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:43,840
engagement was to start from a vdg

02:24:42,319 --> 02:24:46,640
discussion in this case

02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:47,600
and then immediately go uh doing some

02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:51,760
mock-ups

02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:55,439
and uh being democrat mocaps very

02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:57,920
attractive in their look it generated

02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:58,720
in the developers are sent a sense of i

02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:01,040
want that

02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:01,760
so they immediately started working on

02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:03,600
some stuff

02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:04,880
so that's something that really has

02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:08,160
helped has

02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,160
that has helped us

02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:12,479
thanks um lydia what's your take

02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:20,160
um i think i would add to what he has

02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:23,359
have said that um it's very important to

02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:27,040
as a team have an agreed-upon goal right

02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:28,960
um and lots of people have ideas but

02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,399
then at some point you have to

02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:32,000
come together and agree on something and

02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:34,080
say yes this is where we're

02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:38,319
where we're going and the goals i think

02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:41,920
have shown how powerful that can be

02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:44,479
totally agree so now a question just for

02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:45,200
uh for our champions or gold champions

02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:48,800
here

02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:49,359
um i assume the work that you're doing

02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:52,960
would be

02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:55,200
done either way if you're um

02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:56,800
selected as a goal or not but how do you

02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:00,000
think being selected as

02:25:56,800 --> 02:26:02,960
as the goal for uh for now has

02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,399
improved the the work being done on your

02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:06,940
specific topic

02:26:04,399 --> 02:26:09,120
start studying again with jonathan

02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:14,319
[Music]

02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:17,600
uh yes good question it's um

02:26:14,319 --> 02:26:19,280
we a lot of the focus of the activities

02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,240
that wakes me up every at least once

02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:23,280
monsters doing

02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:25,359
those um monthly app updates um

02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:26,800
and of course in doing those i try and

02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:27,920
look at the different stores and and

02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:28,479
feature one of those or interview

02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:30,640
somebody

02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:31,520
involved in them look at the different

02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:34,720
apps and see

02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:35,680
for each app where how can the users get

02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:38,319
those what are the different

02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:40,080
distribution methods that they use um

02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:42,640
and

02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:44,240
and yeah so having that regular monthly

02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:45,359
uh task that that we know we've got to

02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:47,680
do means that

02:26:45,359 --> 02:26:49,520
that i've at least woken up to once a

02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:51,200
month to have a review of

02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:52,720
well how are we doing what has changed

02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,920
in the last month what are we able to do

02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:56,720
so that's been quite a

02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:58,080
useful way to to run the goal is yeah

02:26:56,720 --> 02:27:02,640
making sure you get working out once a

02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:06,720
month to do that

02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:08,720
okay thanks um can i add

02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:10,000
app updates uh please everybody

02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:12,000
contribute to them so

02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,760
yeah if you release an app then please

02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,280
give some notes to us so that i can do

02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,640
it the next one because otherwise it's a

02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:17,520
bit of detective work but it's really

02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:20,240
nice if the

02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:20,720
app maintainers give that give their new

02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:25,120
release

02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:25,120
data to to me or or some sentences to me

02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:32,720
yep thanks

02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:35,680
yeah well as as open source

02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:37,040
enthusiasts and developers we a goal has

02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:39,520
been really great about

02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:40,399
uh helping us focus on some social

02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:42,960
subjects

02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:44,160
where especially within kelly we have we

02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:47,680
have the tendency to

02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:48,479
contribute to other uh to wide variety

02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:50,560
of subjects

02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:52,319
some of our developers and here it was a

02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:55,359
really good opportunity to

02:27:52,319 --> 02:27:56,080
to focus together and and that's one of

02:27:55,359 --> 02:27:57,840
the

02:27:56,080 --> 02:28:00,160
goal elections made to these goals

02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:02,720
particularly is to devote more of our

02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:03,520
time available time to this particular

02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:07,840
end

02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:10,640
and uh it's it's also nice from the

02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:11,200
outside of kde community so that they

02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:14,240
know that

02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:15,040
we have an effort and uh and in working

02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:18,080
towards

02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:18,800
this goal and that's i think helping

02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:22,240
also

02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:25,600
because uh it gives us more credit

02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:27,760
and and more uh

02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,040
well outside communities can see our

02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:32,560
commitments

02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:36,960
and and i think that's gonna serve us

02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:40,160
in and more generally the project

02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:42,479
yeah nicolo well first of all

02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:43,359
being selected as a goal immediately

02:28:42,479 --> 02:28:45,120
gave me

02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,120
much determination much more

02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,920
determination to put effort in it so

02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,399
that was like

02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:52,000
the very first thing but also there was

02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:55,040
much more

02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,280
formal involvement such as we had

02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:59,520
a budget from the board that we actually

02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:02,640
didn't use but it was very nice that

02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:05,600
and we also had a monthly meeting to

02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:08,000
see how it was going and we had the

02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:10,960
opportunity to make a monthly

02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,200
blog updates uh to be repeated by the by

02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:16,479
the official kde account

02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:20,960
and be put on the dot and so on so

02:29:16,479 --> 02:29:22,720
that really make made it much easier

02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:24,479
yeah you're definitely not as scared as

02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:28,000
you showed in in the picture

02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:30,240
from your presentation anymore um

02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,240
okay next question and then that's again

02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:33,120
i think more focus to to our champions

02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:36,080
here

02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:36,960
would you consider becoming a gold

02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:39,760
champion

02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:40,240
maybe for a different topic again after

02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:43,040
this

02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:43,040
this round ends

02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:48,000
uh when i consider becoming a gold

02:29:46,479 --> 02:29:50,080
champion again i

02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,439
i don't want to because i want to that

02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:52,880
this won't be done next year so i want

02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:55,200
to keep going with this stuff

02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:56,399
um depends on what opportunities and who

02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:57,200
knows what will happen in the world over

02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:59,359
the next year it's

02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:01,359
it's quite unpredictable we find out um

02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:03,120
but yeah i think i would want to stay

02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:05,200
actually focused on all about the apps

02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:07,439
after it stops being the primary goal

02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:10,640
but um as with the previous set those

02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:10,640
projects always continue on

02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:17,040
understandable thanks uh maven how about

02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:20,479
you

02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:24,000
well when's the irony that i kind of

02:30:20,479 --> 02:30:26,479
uh participated well uh

02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:27,680
well my goal is not yet finished so i'll

02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:30,560
be working on it so

02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:32,160
i won't be proposing any uh any new one

02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:35,439
anytime soon

02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:36,160
who what the future tells but i know

02:30:35,439 --> 02:30:38,880
that i've been

02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:39,840
already participating into a goal a

02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:42,080
previous goal

02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:43,520
the usability and productivity goal i've

02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:46,080
been contributing

02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:46,720
and that's what's in the first place got

02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:50,080
me into

02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:53,120
the into contribution in fact so

02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:55,680
so it was a very good motivation

02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:56,640
at the start to to add myself to this

02:30:55,680 --> 02:31:00,080
goal so

02:30:56,640 --> 02:31:03,680
my my conclusion is like

02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:07,439
we should being involved in the goal

02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:10,880
is really rewarding and it makes it very

02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:15,840
uh approachable for outsiders to

02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:15,840
to add themselves to

02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:20,160
i thought about it but i don't think i

02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:22,160
will not because i'm not having fun but

02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,600
because i want to give the opportunity

02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:27,520
to someone else to have fun

02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:29,760
because since i was selected my goal

02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:31,840
and i never had the previous kde

02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:34,319
experience i think that

02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:35,760
it is also a way to onboard more people

02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:38,080
so if

02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:39,920
new goals are selected and the gold

02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:42,000
champions are new people that would be

02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:43,600
absolutely amazing

02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,200
yeah i think that's a great take and we

02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:48,560
have finally questions from

02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:51,680
uh from the audience so let me start um

02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:53,200
you are the goal champions right so how

02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:55,040
are final decisions

02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:56,560
made when there are a lot of internal

02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:59,680
contradictions

02:31:56,560 --> 02:32:00,240
let's go with jonathan again well i

02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:03,040
can't feel

02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:04,399
kde um and part of our strength and part

02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,840
of our weakness is that we don't

02:32:04,399 --> 02:32:07,680
necessarily have a

02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:09,040
hierarchy where somebody can say this is

02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:12,160
how it's going to be it's got to be an

02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:15,520
endless discussion until you come to

02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:18,960
a general agreement um being a

02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:20,960
goal champion gold scorer um

02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:22,240
i think does give me a bit more clout

02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:24,960
and ability to say

02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:26,240
this how it's going to be um this

02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:27,359
because it's been chosen by the

02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:30,560
community right

02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:33,920
um so yes i think that does help

02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:35,920
um one

02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:37,680
one one failure that we've had in the

02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:40,240
last year that i had in my slides was

02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:40,800
was the k-snip application where

02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:42,000
somebody

02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:44,160
came to kde and said i've got the

02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:47,680
screenshot tool um can i

02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:49,280
build it in kde um and and there it was

02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:50,720
rejected because people said oh there's

02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:52,479
already a screenshot tool why don't you

02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:54,160
just work on that one and so he

02:32:52,479 --> 02:32:56,080
went away and just did his work

02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:57,600
elsewhere and he's got a successful

02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:58,160
project now so that's very much our

02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,560
failure

02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:01,280
not to do that um and i kind of wish

02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:03,200
that

02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:04,399
i'd i caught that earlier called that

02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:07,040
when it happened

02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:08,000
in order to say no that's that again

02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,880
it's a bit of culture that's got to

02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,880
change where

02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:12,399
yeah if someone wants to do an

02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:13,840
application that does similar features

02:33:12,399 --> 02:33:15,280
to another one that's okay within kd

02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:18,960
that's always been okay

02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:20,399
um within kde um but i didn't quite get

02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:23,600
it in time but i think that if i

02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:25,600
did because because of the goal

02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,359
um then that could have been fixed and

02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,680
hopefully future situations that will be

02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:29,680
fixed

02:33:30,319 --> 02:33:36,479
okay thanks how are final decisions

02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:39,280
being made on your end maven

02:33:36,479 --> 02:33:39,280
well um

02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:47,359
well uh kind of a democratic way i'd say

02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,399
uh we within our goal we didn't have

02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:51,359
many uh

02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:51,680
subjects of hard contradiction it has

02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:55,040
been

02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:57,280
mostly conceptual or work but i would

02:33:55,040 --> 02:34:00,560
say in general it's about democracy

02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:01,520
it's about debating in what's in more

02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:04,000
account

02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:04,720
according to our values first and then

02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,840
uh

02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:13,359
passive and then in the end it's it's

02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:13,359
about who who is the most

02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:19,040
uh

02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:20,000
which of the views is more popular or at

02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:22,460
least uh

02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:25,520
after a good debate and and

02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:28,080
[Music]

02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:29,040
but we didn't have many uh such

02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:32,000
instances

02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:32,000
for the world of gold

02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:37,280
thanks this is a bit of a third question

02:34:36,319 --> 02:34:38,960
because

02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:41,280
that's something we are currently going

02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:42,000
through for the econ size is the final i

02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:45,520
think

02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:48,160
and the answer is that we discuss a lot

02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,840
sometimes even for months and it's a bit

02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:53,600
stressful but i think that

02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:56,560
um the hand aim is to find um

02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:57,120
uh something that we all agree upon we

02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:00,000
all do

02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:01,760
some we sacrifice some thing of our

02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,880
ideas until we find a

02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:08,319
common point and that's very democratic

02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:08,319
democratic of us i think

02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:12,800
thanks the next questions i think could

02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:14,479
be to lydia

02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:15,840
one of the masterminds behind their

02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:17,760
goals initiative

02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:20,960
is there a stipulated time period to

02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:20,960
achieve the goals lydia

02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:27,920
so a lot of the goals aren't really made

02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:30,800
to be

02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:32,240
finished achieved um it's something to

02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:33,120
work towards so for example the

02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:34,720
onboarding goal

02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,319
is clearly something that will be with

02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,800
us for many more years

02:35:36,319 --> 02:35:40,240
um and and as an ongoing thing we have

02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:41,920
to work on um

02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:43,840
as our infrastructure changes as the

02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:44,880
world changes around us as our community

02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:48,640
changes

02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:51,760
um and then there are some that are more

02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:53,600
achievable and more um but in the end

02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:55,200
i think it's more defined the way then

02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:58,240
goes probably the

02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:58,880
the prime example of that um once we

02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:01,200
have

02:35:58,880 --> 02:36:02,319
when in a very good state we can

02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:03,840
probably

02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:05,840
take that off which isn't to say that

02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:08,000
wayland will not need to work after that

02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:11,040
of course

02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:13,680
that answers the question yeah

02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,479
i think so we have only a few minutes

02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:17,280
left

02:36:14,479 --> 02:36:19,280
but let's do another one and i think i

02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:20,080
have a feeling i know the answer to this

02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:21,680
one

02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:23,920
do you feel there are enough people

02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:27,840
working on reaching their current goals

02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:30,000
until next year jonathan

02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:31,439
well as i said i've not been able to get

02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,520
much of community around

02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:34,560
the goal um we have a channel please

02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:36,560
come in and join us

02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:38,960
but that's because a lot of the work is

02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:40,319
is not uh specifically in

02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:41,920
a team that makes up the goal all of the

02:36:40,319 --> 02:36:42,960
work is in the individual applications

02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:46,240
right in the 200

02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:48,000
300 projects we have uh where those

02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:50,160
applications and being developed they

02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,640
also get that final step of

02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:53,200
um being shipped through the stores or

02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:55,680
or in

02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:57,439
easily downloadable packages and a lot

02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:58,960
of that is happening and so every month

02:36:57,439 --> 02:37:00,800
when i write the app updates

02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:02,240
there's new release and i say great this

02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:03,840
new release is available

02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:05,840
through your through the app image or

02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,800
through the through a windows executable

02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:10,240
through the microsoft store

02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:13,200
so that work is happening um

02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:14,560
and this may or may not yes so it's not

02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,680
always happening directly through the

02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:18,000
goal team which is

02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:20,319
totally fine because it should be for

02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,120
the whole kde community to embrace the

02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:23,120
whole philosophy

02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:27,280
okay thanks raven

02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:35,359
yeah given the the

02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:36,960
scope of our goal well you

02:37:35,359 --> 02:37:38,560
there will never be enough people

02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:41,840
basically well it's about

02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:43,520
being as stable and as as a

02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:45,120
great software that we can offer to our

02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:48,720
community and uh

02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:52,240
that's that's just uh an ideal

02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:55,359
uh end goal of a reaching goal so

02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:58,800
so especially for for

02:37:55,359 --> 02:38:00,240
something as technical we will never be

02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:04,080
able to iron out

02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:07,520
any bug and at least for the

02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:12,640
foreseeable future and so

02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:16,800
more people do more than fewer people so

02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:20,640
we are a small a small group currently

02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:23,439
that's uh working all right uh

02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:24,240
as it's uh as a strong with a strong

02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:28,160
pace

02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:28,560
but more people would walk a bit far bit

02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:31,920
more

02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,920
or deliver more ideas

02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,680
that's my view thanks nicole only 60

02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:40,960
seconds

02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,160
i have enough people i think so because

02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:45,359
i uh

02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:45,920
mostly use the consistency sorry the vdg

02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:48,479
group

02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:49,840
as the consistency group kind of because

02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:52,960
that they are very

02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:54,800
related so most of the vg people also

02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:57,840
often work and for consistency

02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:57,840
so yes

02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:02,720
okay and i think we're out of time now

02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,520
thank you very much the gold champions

02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:06,880
lydia for

02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:10,080
taking your time answering questions and

02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:12,399
yeah have a good academy everyone thank

and then the next speaker will come

02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:39,840
thank you

02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:38,080

02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:47,840
in the shared notes

02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:50,000
although i don't think we'll have time

02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:52,880
for any questions we can

02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,240
send the speakers your questions after

02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:57,040
the

02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:58,479
session is over so uh andreas please

02:43:57,040 --> 02:44:01,680
take it away

02:43:58,479 --> 02:44:03,840
okay thank you for the introduction and

02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:05,359
there will be a buff on tuesday so if

02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:08,399
you have questions you can

02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:11,840
answer all of them then okay i have too

02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:15,040
many slides for this short talk i think

02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:17,840
i want to start with

02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:18,960
well what is copyright because um before

02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:22,720
we talk about lines

02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:25,920
licenses and spdx um yeah

02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:28,000
what is the right to copy it's a legal

02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:30,960
construct

02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,880
that defines that you have a right on

02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:33,200
your own work on your creative work and

02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:37,359
you

02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:40,479
simply have it by creating something and

02:44:37,359 --> 02:44:41,120
well it's owned by you you can give it

02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:43,120
away

02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:44,880
it's sometimes even reasonable to give

02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:47,920
it away you should get

02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:49,279
go to agents talk about um giving it to

02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:52,479
the kde in some

02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:55,120
situations um and you can see

02:44:52,479 --> 02:44:55,920
a lot more about copyrights at this link

02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:59,439
below

02:44:55,920 --> 02:45:02,000
they explained really really good but

02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:03,840
i don't want to talk about the things

02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,200
behind copyright and

02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:10,640
licenses but uh what you do and how to

02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:13,279
well allow somebody to use

02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:14,800
the creative work that you did for

02:45:13,279 --> 02:45:17,040
example you created

02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:18,399
a picture you could you wrote a text you

02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:20,960
wrote source code

02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:21,520
and you allow somebody else to do

02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:25,680
something

02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:27,520
with it and um the way to do it is

02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:28,960
well you grant a license to somebody

02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:32,080
else to use it under

02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:35,120
certain conditions um

02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:36,080
such a license you that you use for

02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:39,279
giving away your

02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:41,040
work um we call a free software license

02:45:39,279 --> 02:45:44,240
if it contains um

02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:46,399
for fundamental rights which is

02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:48,000
the right to use it the right to study

02:45:46,399 --> 02:45:51,920
it the right to share it

02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:55,439
and also the right to improve it

02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:56,479
then they add also to often use terms in

02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:59,439
copyright

02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:59,840
or in licenses which is um you have copy

02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:02,160
left

02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:03,520
licenses which simply means you're

02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:07,600
granting

02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:10,319
um a piece of work under a license

02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:12,319
and whoever is sharing it again with

02:46:10,319 --> 02:46:15,760
some improvements or

02:46:12,319 --> 02:46:18,080
changes has to keep the license

02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:19,279
mostly the same and we have permissive

02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:22,720
licenses where

02:46:19,279 --> 02:46:25,840
the license may vanish during the um

02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:25,840
the sharing effect

02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:33,840
um so now

02:46:30,319 --> 02:46:34,800
if we talk about um a source code piece

02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:38,080
of work

02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:40,399
so um i took um i looked at

02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:41,840
some source code files we have in kde

02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:44,319
and um

02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:46,319
this is a real work example from the

02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:48,720
rocks project

02:46:46,319 --> 02:46:50,560
um where we have a license statement

02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:52,240
also a copyright statement

02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:54,319
actually the copyright statement is not

02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:57,600
really necessary because um

02:46:54,319 --> 02:46:59,840
you have your copyright but to make it

02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:01,279
usable to the outside world you always

02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:04,479
should state your copyright

02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:06,640
that you have an ownership on this piece

02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:09,040
of work

02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:10,479
here in that file you can see there are

02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:13,840
a few contributors

02:47:10,479 --> 02:47:15,680
thomas hugo wagner and me we did some

02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:16,880
changes to the code some significant

02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:19,120
changes with

02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:20,160
which mean we have copyright over this

02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:24,000
code

02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:24,880
and we stated what are the terms to use

02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:28,240
it

02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:30,080
and this statement here is what you call

02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:31,439
a traditional license header or license

02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:34,800
statement

02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:35,120
that explains that whoever wants to use

02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:39,040
it

02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:41,040
can use this piece of code under the new

02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:43,760
general public license version 2 or any

02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,760
later version

02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:51,520
and well that's it or that

02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:55,200
was it until some time ago because um

02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:58,800
this statement has a few problems

02:47:55,200 --> 02:48:02,399
um legally it's fine but for the uh

02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:04,240
well from usability exp aspect it's

02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:05,760
not that good because uh we have a long

02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:07,840
text that's

02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:09,680
well it's hard to read for example even

02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:12,160
the cute creator

02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:14,080
well hides the complete copyright or

02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:16,319
license statement because they think

02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:17,760
well it's it's too too hard to read and

02:48:16,319 --> 02:48:21,200
nobody's interested in

02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:24,319
but well then nobody reads it and

02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:25,040
things happen that shouldn't happen for

02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:28,399
example

02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:30,960
um well there are different

02:48:28,399 --> 02:48:32,640
ways to to say that this code is under

02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:36,319
the gpa

02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:39,600
um you can even create your completely

02:48:36,319 --> 02:48:41,359
own license header and you can use a

02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,120
license header where there's an address

02:48:41,359 --> 02:48:44,960
of the free software foundation and when

02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:48,319
the freezer foundation moves

02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:48,720
the license header changes and you can

02:48:48,319 --> 02:48:51,120
use

02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:53,040
one license header and modify it by hand

02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:53,520
you create a new license header out of

02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:57,120
it

02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:59,600
and maybe you do some some

02:48:57,120 --> 02:49:00,240
copy-paste errors and then you have an

02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:02,880
ambitious

02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:05,040
statement it's not clear if it's a gpa

02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:08,640
or an lgbt license it um

02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:11,120
that is quite a big problem because um

02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:13,200
we are talking about legal texts here

02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:17,279
and just to bring an example um

02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:19,920
for the lgpl 2.0 or later usage in kde

02:49:17,279 --> 02:49:22,080
fair x5 i found about

02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:24,720
36 different license statements in all

02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:24,720
of our code

02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:30,640
um so

02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:32,319
that's not a good way because it's hard

02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:34,080
hard to read for humans it's extremely

02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:36,800
hard to read it um

02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:38,160
as a as a tool because you have to do

02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:41,120
some fuzzy checking and it's

02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:42,000
never a good idea for a tool so an

02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:45,359
improvement is

02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:48,000
to do something that's machine readable

02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:49,680
and for that we have the so called spdx

02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,720
markers

02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:56,160
there's a database actually at

02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:56,960
this link below the fpdx.org licenses

02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:59,040
list

02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:00,240
um which lists a lot of open source

02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:03,279
licenses

02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:06,560
um and well instead of

02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:08,000
just pasting and just adding such a long

02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:10,800
text you simply say

02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:11,600
this id look up this id and this

02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:14,800
explains

02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:14,800
the license of your file

02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:21,439
spdx actually does a lot more but

02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:22,560
the two most important points there are

02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:25,040
we have a

02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:27,520
standardized identifier for copyright

02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:30,560
with sbdx5 copyright text

02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:33,520
and an spdx license identifier

02:50:30,560 --> 02:50:34,000
and after that you can simply add the id

02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:37,439
or

02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:38,399
in a specific format the year the

02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:42,560
ownership

02:50:38,399 --> 02:50:45,680
and the contact to the author

02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:49,439
and well um if you look up

02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:51,840
fbx uh you will see it's um quite a big

02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:52,640
legal spec written by legal experts and

02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:55,200
you can

02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:56,399
express much more than simply the um the

02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:59,439
copyright and the

02:50:56,399 --> 02:51:01,520
license there are many many things um

02:50:59,439 --> 02:51:03,680
next to it and usually it's really hard

02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:06,560
to to apply by developer

02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:08,000
so there's um initiative by the free

02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:10,160
software foundation europe

02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,600
which is called the reuse dot software

02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:15,439
initiative

02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:18,319
and that defines a really small subset

02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:20,000
of rules that you can use to um to apply

02:51:18,319 --> 02:51:23,040
to the project to make it

02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:26,479
machine readable and compatible with

02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:29,760
the spdx specification

02:51:26,479 --> 02:51:32,960
um and well we actually apply this

02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:36,080
since sometime in kde

02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:38,399
it's done quite simple actually

02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:39,920
in a nutshell you only have to do three

02:51:38,399 --> 02:51:42,640
things you have to add the

02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:43,920
license identifier get copyright

02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:46,240
identifier

02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:47,040
for every contributor and for the

02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:49,200
license

02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:51,120
you have get the license file to a

02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:52,640
certain location in your source code

02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:55,840
repository

02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:58,479
um for details there we have a

02:51:55,840 --> 02:51:59,840
wiki page for how-to that explains how

02:51:58,479 --> 02:52:03,359
to do licensing

02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:04,240
with videos in sbdx and that also links

02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:08,640
to the license

02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:12,399
policy of kde to bring example

02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:15,040
just look at the remember the copyright

02:52:12,399 --> 02:52:18,319
header that i showed you before

02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:21,760
if you reconvert it to fptx or the

02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:25,680
reuse compatible spx usage

02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:28,319
then it's much simpler we have

02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:28,720
identifiers for the copyright holders we

02:52:28,319 --> 02:52:31,600
have

02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:32,160
one line that points to the license to

02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:35,200
use

02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:38,319
and that's it and it's machine readable

02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:40,000
and really really simple and that's a

02:52:38,319 --> 02:52:41,840
big idea

02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:43,600
and it's actually important that we do

02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:45,920
it because um

02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:47,200
if we don't care about licenses uh we

02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:49,760
can get to the

02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:51,359
situation where we have con conflicting

02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:54,080
contradicting licenses

02:52:51,359 --> 02:52:54,399
in the same application or same library

02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:56,000
and

02:52:54,399 --> 02:52:57,600
that's the problem for distributions and

02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,800
every everybody who use

02:52:57,600 --> 02:53:03,840
the compiled binaries um

02:53:00,800 --> 02:53:06,000
we try and the kda community to um

02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:07,040
use licenses that are mostly um

02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,680
compatibility

02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:11,279
each other actually there are licenses

02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:13,600
in the world that are not really

02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:14,880
not compatible and you have to be

02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:17,600
careful here

02:53:14,880 --> 02:53:19,760
so we have um only a subset of licenses

02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:24,160
that we encourage to use

02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:27,200
so mostly gpl lgpl bsdcc

02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:30,560
also for all the details we have a

02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:31,520
policy that explains when and how to use

02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:34,960
it

02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:37,359
and the big problem here is often

02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:38,319
that you really have to be careful about

02:53:37,359 --> 02:53:41,920
the certain

02:53:38,319 --> 02:53:45,760
versions of the license also in details

02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:50,800
at that page and

02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:53,120
if we do times up

02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:54,560
then we have good tooling that is just

02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:56,640
coming up

02:53:54,560 --> 02:53:57,680
and we have a really cool tool to test

02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:59,439
everything

02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:01,279
it's here on the slides and the slides

02:53:59,439 --> 02:54:04,560
are attached to the torque and

02:54:01,279 --> 02:54:06,880
on the control website and if you want

02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:08,960
to convert your project

02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:10,560
come to the buff and we explain how to

02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:14,240
do it

02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:16,399
thanks thank you so much sorry to cut

02:54:14,240 --> 02:54:20,240
you off

02:54:16,399 --> 02:54:23,200
next we have

02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:23,600
sean and he will be doing the next fast

02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:27,600
track

02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:31,359
this one is a video but sean is here

02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:35,200
uh so sean welcome and thank you

02:54:31,359 --> 02:54:38,720
thanks yo i'm just queuing up your video

02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:38,720
and we'll get right to it

02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:49,520
this is a session about editing markdown

02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:51,120
with q text document

02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:53,120
using either widgets or cute quick and

02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:55,600
one of the new features in cube 514

02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:57,760
was markdown support in q-text document

02:54:55,600 --> 02:55:00,960
and this turns out to apply as well to

02:54:57,760 --> 02:55:01,520
text and qml if a link is clicked inside

02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:03,680
this

02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:06,160
text object then i want to open the url

02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:09,040
externally so if i click this markdown

02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:10,640
then it loaded this link here the

02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:12,479
motivations for doing this

02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:14,000
there's always been historically a bit

02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:14,800
of a disconnect between wysiwyg

02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,560
applications

02:55:14,800 --> 02:55:18,399
and plain text editing and people who

02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:18,960
use plain text editors think that their

02:55:18,399 --> 02:55:20,560
way is

02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:22,399
superior you shouldn't depend on one

02:55:20,560 --> 02:55:23,920
particular tool right markdown is a

02:55:22,399 --> 02:55:25,600
really nice compromise

02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:27,120
you can use a plain text editor to write

02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:29,120
markdown but now

02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:30,560
can also write wysiwyg applications that

02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:31,760
look just like word processors but

02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:33,600
actually are writing this

02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:35,760
format which you're able to edit by hand

02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:37,439
as well i've been using to do.text

02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:39,040
format for shopping lists and

02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:40,640
to-do lists and things like that but

02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:42,000
that doesn't allow you to write

02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:44,000
any kind of notes along with your

02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,840
checklist items it's just a checklist

02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,760
i think that markdown is a better format

02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:49,200
for doing things like that

02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:51,200
i think it would also be a better format

02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:52,800
to use by default for email

02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:55,439
and as sort of a consensus convention

02:55:52,800 --> 02:55:57,200
which turned into a formalized format

02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:58,640
so i think that since people have

02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:00,000
already been writing markdown all this

02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:01,359
time for emails why don't we just go

02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,479
ahead and say that emails are usually

02:56:01,359 --> 02:56:04,319
marked down

02:56:02,479 --> 02:56:05,520
the only html emails you get would be

02:56:04,319 --> 02:56:07,279
commercial ones and then that would be a

02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:09,040
nice way to filter them out but i'm sure

02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:10,000
within the kde community you probably

02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,680
can come up with

02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,120
more ideas for what applications you'd

02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:15,200
like to use markdown

02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:17,359
another motivation is that qtex document

02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:19,520
supports a limited subset of html

02:56:17,359 --> 02:56:21,359
but it's disappointing to people how

02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:23,279
little of html that we support

02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:25,200
but it turns out that the qtex document

02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:26,640
feature set is a very close match for

02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:28,880
the markdown feature set

02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:31,279
so there was a hackathon in december

02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:31,680
2017 at the cute company and i decided

02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:33,200
to

02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:34,720
implement as much of that as i could in

02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:36,160
a couple of days

02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:37,920
and then it took several more months of

02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:39,200
refinement before we shipped so the

02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:42,160
feature set that we have

02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:43,439
a qtex document already had two html and

02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:45,279
set html

02:56:43,439 --> 02:56:46,720
and so alongside those i added set

02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:48,720
markdown and two markdown

02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:50,240
we support the github dialect by default

02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:51,840
when you call set markdown

02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:53,680
in addition to gifting the string that

02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:55,439
you want to parse you can also give

02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:56,960
these flags you can specify that you

02:56:55,439 --> 02:56:58,319
only want to use common mark without the

02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:01,439
github extensions

02:56:58,319 --> 02:57:04,479
and you can also set no html so thanks

02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:06,800
to martin for implementing md4c

02:57:04,479 --> 02:57:08,240
during the hackathon i was looking for a

02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:09,920
library that i could use

02:57:08,240 --> 02:57:12,000
for the parser because i didn't really

02:57:09,920 --> 02:57:14,319
want to try to write one myself

02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,880
so we're actually bundling it with cute

02:57:14,319 --> 02:57:20,080
and currently we ship version 0.43

02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:21,600
in 5.15 and we hope that eventually md4c

02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:23,359
is going to be popular enough that the

02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:23,920
distress will all have it and we'll be

02:57:23,359 --> 02:57:26,960
able to

02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:27,520
stop bundling it with q so here's an

02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:31,200
example

02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:33,840
using qt quick controls 2 i used xhr

02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:35,200
to load an md file which of course is

02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:37,840
not something that we're supposed to be

02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:40,319
doing in q6 for example

02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:41,279
the text area markdown you can scroll

02:57:40,319 --> 02:57:43,359
through it

02:57:41,279 --> 02:57:45,040
and if you hover a hyperlink it shows

02:57:43,359 --> 02:57:46,720
you feedback down at the bottom

02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:48,399
the next example i want to show you is

02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:50,560
netbook which is one that i'm

02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:51,920
that i've written for my personal use so

02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:54,000
my source directory i've got a version

02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:56,720
of this built

02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:58,080
so i can edit my readme text file now

02:57:56,720 --> 02:58:04,080
and

02:57:58,080 --> 02:58:06,479
um i can format it different ways

02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:08,880
and let's say i want to add some bullet

02:58:06,479 --> 02:58:08,880
items

02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:15,520
so i can convert all of these to bullet

02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:18,560
points now by selecting that style

02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:22,160
control right bracket will indent i can

02:58:18,560 --> 02:58:22,160
change to a different type of bullet

02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:27,840
so it has the the three types that cute

02:58:26,800 --> 02:58:29,600
supports

02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:31,680
another feature that i liked of course

02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:35,120
is being able to do the check boxes

02:58:31,680 --> 02:58:37,279
so you could start by writing something

02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:38,960
whether it's a bullet point or not you

02:58:37,279 --> 02:58:39,439
can convert it to a checkbox by hitting

02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:41,760
ctrl

02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:43,520
k which is another way of toggling the

02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:45,040
check mark

02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:48,399
or once i've got the checkbox i can

02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:48,399
simply click it to toggle it

02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:53,680
so now let's save this readme text file

02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:55,600
and um

02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:56,880
so there's the stuff that i added and

02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:59,279
notice that the bullets are

02:58:56,880 --> 02:59:00,640
are the different types there based on

02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:01,760
the bullets that i chose in the style

02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:03,920
check box and

02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:05,279
the check boxes are ones checked and the

02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:07,120
other is not

02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:08,800
but another thing that i discovered is

02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:10,399
that it's useful for saving snippets of

02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:11,600
information off of the web let's

02:59:10,399 --> 02:59:12,880
let's say for example i've been

02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:14,399
searching on the web and i found this

02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:15,279
recipe it sounds interesting i want to

02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:17,439
try

02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:18,960
at the top it has pictures and so forth

02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:20,399
but um

02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:22,479
i don't need to save all that but i want

02:59:20,399 --> 02:59:26,240
to save the recipe itself

02:59:22,479 --> 02:59:26,240
so i just select the text

02:59:26,319 --> 02:59:32,399
copy it to the clipboard and i'm going

02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:34,640
to create a markdown file

02:59:32,399 --> 02:59:35,920
i paste this text into there cute

02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:38,319
already had really great

02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:40,240
clipboard support now i've got my md

02:59:38,319 --> 02:59:40,640
file and this looks so good that i don't

02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:42,479
mind

02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:44,000
reading it with a plain text editor on

02:59:42,479 --> 02:59:45,520
the command line or however but of

02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:47,200
course i can also just

02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:49,359
start up netbook again in the browser

02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:51,120
mode the main control is actually a qtex

02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:52,560
browser so it gives me a nice view of

02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:53,680
this and if i was running this in the

02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:56,640
kitchen it'd be a nice

02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:58,160
way to to view the recipe and cook so

02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:00,560
another thing i wanted to be able to do

02:59:58,160 --> 03:00:04,720
is to blog with this tool

03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:06,240
and um i don't feel like writing text

03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:08,800
right now during this presentation

03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:09,680
that takes time um i'm going to write a

03:00:08,800 --> 03:00:12,240
new blog post

03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:14,240
markdown file and i'm simply going to

03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:16,160
paste in some text from the web

03:00:14,240 --> 03:00:18,080
this is another talk at academy about

03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:19,760
the input handling update which you also

03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:22,080
might want to watch it's not quite as

03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:25,040
interesting as this talk though

03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:26,399
so i save to a markdown file simply by

03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:29,359
copying and pasting

03:00:26,399 --> 03:00:31,359
notice it actually got the image as well

03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:32,880
and there's a feature

03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:34,319
that if you check this box it will try

03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:36,720
to save the resources alongside the

03:00:34,319 --> 03:00:39,760
documents and you get to specify

03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:44,800
the suffix for the resource folder

03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:44,800
and um so now if i

03:00:46,080 --> 03:00:50,479
count this markdown file you see that it

03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:52,399
actually has the

03:00:50,479 --> 03:00:54,240
the resources and it got the alt text as

03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:56,240
well from

03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:57,520
the resources and it got the alt text as

03:00:56,240 --> 03:01:01,040
well from the

03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:02,720
from the html so i have this ready to go

03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:06,160
now i have a markdown file i can

03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:08,800
read it again um i want to publish this

03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:10,800
so i was thinking about using ipfs for

03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:13,920
this purpose for publishing things

03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:16,880
so what is ipfs it's

03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:17,520
um a content addressed peer-to-peer file

03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:20,240
system

03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:22,000
for the distributed decentralized web

03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:24,479
that's kind of a mouthful

03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:26,000
what that basically means is that when

03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:28,479
you save files to ipfs

03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:31,040
it's like a file system but the files

03:01:28,479 --> 03:01:33,600
are hashed

03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:35,439
if i simply hit save to ipfs in the file

03:01:33,600 --> 03:01:38,000
menu

03:01:35,439 --> 03:01:38,800
it gets its hash and it has now been

03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,800
pinned

03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:42,399
which means that it's available it's

03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:43,600
going to be held there in my local file

03:01:42,399 --> 03:01:48,399
system

03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:51,200
and it can be served to others so

03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:52,800
if i look at my pins this one ends with

03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:55,040
r6q

03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:56,800
so there it is and now i'll show you one

03:01:55,040 --> 03:02:00,000
of the browser

03:01:56,800 --> 03:02:02,960
features of netbook um

03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:04,399
i can just look at all of my local files

03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:05,120
and there's the blog post that i just

03:02:04,399 --> 03:02:06,800
created

03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:09,120
so there's the file and it knows how to

03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:09,680
load this um so why does that work at

03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:11,439
all

03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:13,520
well it's because i wrote a kio slave

03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:16,000
for ipfs along with this project

03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:18,080
so the result is that you can use

03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:21,120
dolphin for example to view

03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:23,200
the local ipfs

03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:24,240
files as well not sure why that

03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:25,760
directory doesn't work

03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:27,840
some of these are markdown files most of

03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:29,600
them are markdown files and now i can

03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:30,160
open it with any application that's able

03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:33,520
to use

03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:35,279
kio slaves i think that this ipfs kao

03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:37,120
slave should start to ship at some point

03:02:35,279 --> 03:02:38,479
i want to try to get it into the distros

03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:39,279
but it does need a bit more work it's

03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:40,960
got some bugs

03:02:39,279 --> 03:02:42,319
i'm not sure about the future of kao in

03:02:40,960 --> 03:02:43,279
general maybe you guys could tell me

03:02:42,319 --> 03:02:44,560
more about that

03:02:43,279 --> 03:02:46,319
so eventually i want to be able to

03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:48,000
publish real blogs this way where not

03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:49,520
only i create the post but i also

03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:51,439
update an index that links to the new

03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:52,880
post um so how do we publish things on

03:02:51,439 --> 03:02:55,359
the web with ipfs

03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:57,439
you see that a file has a hash there's

03:02:55,359 --> 03:02:59,760
zuco's triangle which says that you can

03:02:57,439 --> 03:03:01,279
only have two of three of these

03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:03,200
properties at the same time it can be

03:03:01,279 --> 03:03:05,439
human meaningful like a domain name

03:03:03,200 --> 03:03:07,279
it can be decentralized like ipfs it can

03:03:05,439 --> 03:03:09,279
be secure like ipfs

03:03:07,279 --> 03:03:11,040
so they so there's this ipns the naming

03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:11,760
system which allows you to map one hash

03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:14,240
to another

03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:15,040
so ipns will allow you to publish a

03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:17,359
fixed hash

03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:18,080
and that can point to a changing hash

03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:19,359
and so

03:03:18,080 --> 03:03:22,000
they came up with this dns link

03:03:19,359 --> 03:03:23,680
mechanism there's a text record which

03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:26,800
says what the dns link is

03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:29,760
for netbook.org and that is an ips

03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:31,520
name it's using the ip naming system the

03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:34,160
result is if i go to

03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:35,760
netbook.org i still have this con loaded

03:03:34,160 --> 03:03:37,760
on a conventional web server

03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:39,439
but it contains a redirect so that if

03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:40,960
everything is working right it will use

03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:43,760
the ipfs io

03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:45,040
gateway to eventually load the ipfs

03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:47,520
version of the website

03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:48,479
so this is html but what i eventually

03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:49,840
want to do

03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:51,760
is to be able to publish markdown

03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:53,680
directly to the web and

03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:55,359
there are javascript libraries for

03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:57,359
rendering marked down into the browser

03:03:55,359 --> 03:03:58,240
like strapdown.js is the one that i was

03:03:57,359 --> 03:03:59,680
thinking of using

03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:01,439
so eventually i want to make netbook

03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:03,359
into a blogging tool which can publish a

03:04:01,439 --> 03:04:05,359
blog in markdown on ipfs

03:04:03,359 --> 03:04:06,880
rendering in the browser is basically up

03:04:05,359 --> 03:04:08,800
to your browser to do for itself by

03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:10,160
running the javascript library so that's

03:04:08,800 --> 03:04:11,439
uh that's the long-term vision but i'm

03:04:10,160 --> 03:04:14,000
not there yet

03:04:11,439 --> 03:04:15,760
so stuff left to work on by which i mean

03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:18,479
the stuff left to work on in qtex

03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:19,760
browser and then cute in general and of

03:04:18,479 --> 03:04:21,680
course i want to just keep

03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:24,000
keep fixing bugs especially in the

03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:25,279
writer because the markdown writer is

03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:27,520
something that i wrote myself

03:04:25,279 --> 03:04:29,520
so there tends to be bugs in that code

03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:31,359
um i just fixed several of those in

03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:32,640
515.1 so it's getting better

03:04:31,359 --> 03:04:34,000
whenever you're able to read a

03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:35,359
particular markdown file and then you're

03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,319
not able to write it back out or it

03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:38,399
writes it out wrong

03:04:36,319 --> 03:04:39,680
you can write a bug about that so that's

03:04:38,399 --> 03:04:42,080
the end

03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:51,840
thanks for watching and enjoy markdown

03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:51,840
and cute

03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:59,439
so that was that and i guess the next

03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:59,439
person should be up now right

03:05:00,319 --> 03:05:03,600
yes thank you so much sean that was

03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:06,399
great

03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:08,800
um do you have a bath plan for later in

03:05:06,399 --> 03:05:08,800
the week

03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:13,040
no i need to look at those and figure

03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:14,960
something out yeah

03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:17,200
okay well i guess then everyone should

03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:20,399
keep their eye out for that

03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:21,120
up next we have carl and he will be up

03:05:20,399 --> 03:05:32,640
in just

03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:35,040
a moment

03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:36,880
all right maybe carl just needs to

03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:47,840
unmute himself

03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:47,840
and we can get going

03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:01,840
okay

03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:10,800
it seems carl has been disconnected

03:06:09,920 --> 03:06:13,680
somehow

03:06:10,800 --> 03:06:14,240
so we will just take a moment to find

03:06:13,680 --> 03:06:29,840
him

03:06:14,240 --> 03:06:29,840
i am sorry for the technical glitch

03:07:35,279 --> 03:07:39,359
all right well it looks like carl's

03:07:37,439 --> 03:07:53,840
presentation is here

03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:53,840
and we are ready to go

03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:44,720
carl you need to unmute yourself you

03:08:41,359 --> 03:08:44,720
still look like you are muted

03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:48,640
just click the microphone button on the

03:08:47,120 --> 03:08:52,160
bottom of the screen

03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:55,600
okay do you hear me though

03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:59,040
loud and clear okay perfect

03:08:55,600 --> 03:09:02,880
hello everyone i will present you

03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:06,000
some tips what i learned during

03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:08,240
working on the website and how to

03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:09,500
effectively effectively promote your kd

03:09:08,240 --> 03:09:12,530
project on the web

03:09:09,500 --> 03:09:12,530
[Music]

03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:21,040
so firstly uh

03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:22,000
i have a we have a webcam for the

03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:25,439
website

03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:28,560
called either uh it

03:09:25,439 --> 03:09:28,560
provides all the

03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:35,680
kelly binding out of the box

03:09:33,930 --> 03:09:38,560
[Music]

03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:42,160
so this is the look of the website

03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:42,160
created with the eithertime

03:09:43,600 --> 03:09:47,439
and it's used by many websites so i

03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:50,080
think i listed

03:09:47,439 --> 03:09:51,040
every website here but maybe i forgot

03:09:50,080 --> 03:09:53,359
some

03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:54,640
and the advantage of the this time is

03:09:53,359 --> 03:09:57,680
what it

03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:58,720
would have put up for best so all the

03:09:57,680 --> 03:10:01,920
documentation

03:09:58,720 --> 03:10:04,239
about bootstrap is provided by the team

03:10:01,920 --> 03:10:06,000
it's all set on the kde cdn so every

03:10:04,239 --> 03:10:09,680
time i'm doing update

03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:13,120
it's propagate to the aoe web website

03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:15,520
i almost instantly here

03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:16,399
and it provides all the kd bindings or

03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:19,120
the noto sound

03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:20,399
auto sound font the mad back kiddie logo

03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:23,840
the viewers in color

03:10:20,399 --> 03:10:23,840
and many other things

03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:31,439
but it's only a css stem so you need to

03:10:28,640 --> 03:10:33,279
create all the html boilerplate yourself

03:10:31,439 --> 03:10:36,399
and for teas there is a

03:10:33,279 --> 03:10:38,479
gcal theme gqal is a

03:10:36,399 --> 03:10:39,439
static website generator used by many

03:10:38,479 --> 03:10:43,359
websites and caddy

03:10:39,439 --> 03:10:43,760
yeah and it's provide all the bullet pad

03:10:43,359 --> 03:10:47,439
for you

03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:50,399
so it's even faster to create websites

03:10:47,439 --> 03:10:50,960
and we have some documentation firstly

03:10:50,399 --> 03:10:54,000
the

03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:55,840
tutorial created by thiago sueto and

03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:58,800
many thanks to him

03:10:55,840 --> 03:11:00,800
and we have also in the wind b a many

03:10:58,800 --> 03:11:04,000
configuration options detailed

03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:05,120
on it and there is also exam folder you

03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,399
grab you can copy

03:11:05,120 --> 03:11:11,600
copy and have your website almost

03:11:08,399 --> 03:11:13,920
instantly done you don't need to fill

03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:16,800
the content

03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:18,399
and you also have a brief icon font

03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:21,520
developer for the web

03:11:18,399 --> 03:11:23,760
it's quite easy to uh to use or only

03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:26,800
need to include the um

03:11:23,760 --> 03:11:31,120
css file from the cdn and then you can

03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:33,439
just create icons by including them

03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:34,319
and you have i have a list of all the

03:11:33,439 --> 03:11:39,200
icons

03:11:34,319 --> 03:11:43,279
and website this is the cdnkd.org

03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:43,279
icons icons.email

03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:49,439
okay um the next an accepting created

03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:52,960
quite a cool

03:11:49,439 --> 03:11:55,760
good website is the content and it's

03:11:52,960 --> 03:11:57,840
quite important and for this i would

03:11:55,760 --> 03:12:00,319
recommend to not

03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:05,120
create a wall of text like in this

03:12:00,319 --> 03:12:08,239
example but instead uh

03:12:05,120 --> 03:12:11,920
add some images like in uh and

03:12:08,239 --> 03:12:12,560
colors to uh make it pleasant for the

03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:15,760
eyes

03:12:12,560 --> 03:12:18,399
and so what user what come to your

03:12:15,760 --> 03:12:22,160
website uh

03:12:18,399 --> 03:12:22,160
is attracted by the aid

03:12:25,680 --> 03:12:32,960
another helpful advice is to describe

03:12:29,359 --> 03:12:35,200
describes is to not describe the

03:12:32,960 --> 03:12:38,239
application what the application is but

03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:41,040
um explain what the application allows

03:12:38,239 --> 03:12:42,880
allows the user to do uh though um

03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:46,720
instead of saying what uh

03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:51,520
plasma is a desktop development based on

03:12:46,720 --> 03:12:54,000
widgets what is fast and efficient

03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:54,000
and

03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:58,960
you need to say what it allows to do

03:12:57,120 --> 03:13:01,200
event it's a bit of fly because it's not

03:12:58,960 --> 03:13:02,960
plasma but allow you to serve the web

03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:05,520
it's a web browser but

03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:05,520
it's um

03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:14,080
you need to explain what you can do with

03:13:08,720 --> 03:13:18,560
the application and

03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:21,840
okay and last uh thing to say is uh

03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:25,120
not everyone need a website um

03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:28,479
it's a lot of work to maintain and uh

03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:30,800
it's better to note our website from our

03:13:28,479 --> 03:13:32,160
website what is maintained and where

03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:35,439
we've screenshot with

03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:39,359
what are 10 years old so

03:13:35,439 --> 03:13:42,080
for this use case we have

03:13:39,359 --> 03:13:43,680
the caddy.org applications what is all

03:13:42,080 --> 03:13:47,040
the website and create

03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:48,560
a good looking home page for your

03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:52,479
project

03:13:48,560 --> 03:13:56,479
it's based on the upstream data

03:13:52,479 --> 03:13:59,200
so every time you

03:13:56,479 --> 03:14:00,399
doing update your app screen data what

03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:04,000
are also

03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:04,000
displayed on disk cover and

03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:10,319
application center uh

03:14:07,120 --> 03:14:13,680
it's also deployed to the website

03:14:10,319 --> 03:14:18,000
and it supports localization

03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:21,760
screenshot but also release information

03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:24,880
so you can

03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:25,920
write blog posts in it a sort of blog

03:14:24,880 --> 03:14:29,680
post with

03:14:25,920 --> 03:14:32,880
news about your application you can

03:14:29,680 --> 03:14:33,920
add link to the stores for example the

03:14:32,880 --> 03:14:36,399
microsoft store

03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:37,279
the play store have to read like what

03:14:36,399 --> 03:14:41,359
jonathan said

03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:44,640
earlier and it's quite less

03:14:41,359 --> 03:14:48,640
work to do than what in

03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:48,640
