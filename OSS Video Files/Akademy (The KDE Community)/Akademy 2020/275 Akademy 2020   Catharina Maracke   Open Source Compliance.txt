Description: 
	"While Free and Open Source Software development has tremendously benefitted from (open) technical standards, the rise of OSS usage and importance along with compliance requirements for different OSS license obligations still creates too many friction points and high costs in many organizations. This is especially true for today’s software supply chain, be in the commercial text or in the context of OSS projects. Almost all companies active in the software industry receive software packages from various different sources to be implemented in their products before sold or licensed. A very similar situation can be found when developing software in the context of OSS projects or foundations. Many different software packages are licensed under different OSS licenses leaving developers and project managers with the question of responsibility when distributing and selling OSS products.



In today's jungle of OSS license compliance, it is more important than ever to know the very basics of copyright and licensing structures as well as some of the relevant tips and tricks for the most common OSS licenses.


The proposed talk will look into copyright and licensing details and will give an overview of today’s most important challenges when working with different OSS licenses."
