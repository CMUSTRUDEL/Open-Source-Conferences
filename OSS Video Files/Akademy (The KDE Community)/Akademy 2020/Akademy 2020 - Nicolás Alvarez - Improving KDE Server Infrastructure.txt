Title: Akademy 2020 - Nicolás Alvarez - Improving KDE Server Infrastructure
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The KDE Sysadmin Team has started doing some work behind the scenes to reduce "technical debt" in the way we manage the servers. Some manual tasks are becoming scripts, we have better documentation, and more things can be tested locally before putting them in the real servers. Nicolás will give a quick overview of these changes and our progress expanding them to more services.

Nicolás will also show how these improvements should make it easier for new sysadmins and web developers to contribute!
