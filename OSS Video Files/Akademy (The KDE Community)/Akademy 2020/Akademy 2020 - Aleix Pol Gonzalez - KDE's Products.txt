Title: Akademy 2020 - Aleix Pol Gonzalez - KDE's Products
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	In KDE we create a myriad of things for different kind of people. We create frameworks, we create applications, we create environments. And we create it for different kind of people be it other people like us, high school students, 3rd party developers, distribution packagers and more than we can imagine (really!).

In this presentation I would like to offer a framework to explain how we can embrace philosophies and ultimately technologies to make sure the Free Software community and its users are best taken care of.

[Music]

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,719
all right

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,440
so this is going to be a bit of a

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,720
weird presentation for me because it's

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
kind of a bit

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,160
outside of my comfort zone but on the

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,199
other hand it's something that i've

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,599
uh missed in what we do for a while

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,880
so what i want you to get from this

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,160
presentation is a little bit of

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
ideas or inspiration

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,239
on how you could uh focus your work into

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,000
making sure

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,200
that we are caring and

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,920
doing the most for out of our work

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
overall first of all let me present

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:13,840
myself

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:13,840
anything you see something

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,799
well i guess that my presentation slide

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,400
is gone uh so let me just explain it

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,520
um my name is alesh i

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
am a kdu developer i have been for over

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
a decade right now

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,119
i'm also the ktv president uh as i was

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,280
introduced as well

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,439
i'm employed by blue systems doing

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
software uh work

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,720
on kitty and i am based in barcelona in

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,360
the lovely mediterranean coast

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:53,280
now um what i wanted to reflect on today

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,000
is that we're all consumer of things we

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
are all very used to by using consumer

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
products it's

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,719
what economy has been about in over the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,560
last century

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,759
and well it has its upsides and

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,160
they are kind of all

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,599
geared towards of being able to use

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
things and use them easily

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,599
and i think that this is something very

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
directly related to what we do

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,440
what we do as kde which is create things

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
so that

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,640
specifically software pieces of software

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
so that people can

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,400
can enjoy them and and use them as tools

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
right

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,040
not unlike other software products not

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,680
unlike um

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
i don't know a bag of chips right uh

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,319
when you

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,080
need uh to be able to get emails you

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,160
will get k-mail when you need

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:48,560
to get carbohydrates you will

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,640
buy pasta right so

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,160
we all familiarize with the concept of

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
product and

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,080
in the end it's a lot of what we create

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
we create products for people to

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,239
well check their emails and a bunch of

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,720
stuff now

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
i think that it would be interesting for

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,000
for a second to

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,040
take a step back and think about how

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,319
um a consumer somebody who's used to buy

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
a bag of tips and

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
someone who's uh used to buying cars and

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,040
tvs

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,879
well they're gonna consume our software

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
right uh because

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,120
uh while many people

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,760
use it uh thousands and

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,840
some people say millions uh use our

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,720
software

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,480
um well we we have all wonder why

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,760
it isn't billions and in the end

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,319
part of our task is to make it easy

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
not just to have our products used but

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,879
to make sure that

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,599
uh everybody can reach uh

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,120
technology hardware computation internet

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,680
etc right

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,720
so that's what uh i would like to

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,480
discuss and since i didn't really know

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,799
how to calculate this conversation i

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,040
reached out to my university

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
uh notes where they talked about

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
something that is called the marketing

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
mix

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,080
uh something that uh economists like

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,199
allowed to do is to

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,759
uh have acronyms for things so these are

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
the four p's of the marketing mix

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
which i'm gonna talk about and then i

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,600
would like to see how they match

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
what what we're doing in in kde and

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,720
actually i think that a lot of

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,280
it would uh also apply to any increase

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,320
of our project it's not like we're doing

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,400
all that worse than the rest it's uh i

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,280
really care about kde

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,199
now first of all we need to we have the

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,320
product we need to define it

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,800
when we talk about um

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,880
a bag of chips it's not only like the

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
potatoes right it's the potatoes

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,720
processed in a very specific way

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080
so that it's easy for you to consume not

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
unlike our

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
our software products right when we talk

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
about

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,639
what is um

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,240
gig important for example kig is a

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,039
geometry application for educational

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
students

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,520
well it is important not because people

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
don't have other ways to draw circles

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
and lines right

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
it's because we create a product that

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
has been thought

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
from the start so that people can can

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,600
learn can

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,880
do their geometry work over

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,080
over that piece of software what's like

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,240
plasma for example as well right

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,360
plasmas um

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,280
idea is to acknowledge that people will

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
want to have a computer some software

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,479
and they will want to make the the best

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
out of it and

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
when we try to simplify it by providing

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,240
a graphical user interface but a lot

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
more stuff right we have

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
all of the services around it everything

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,880
is geared towards

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,039
um creating this one product that

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,039
should satisfy whoever consumes it

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
and while we all know that plasma fits

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,160
in the whole community

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,039
in a well much more complex light we're

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,319
all

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,199
aware about how all of uh while linux

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,479
works

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,720
we're still something that people are

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,919
perceived directly right

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
while we're part of the big thing people

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,120
expect

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,759
us to be delivering it as a product and

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,360
actually be

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,360
as good as it is

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
from when they buy it from something

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,400
more commercial that

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,840
would be like i said a pack of chips if

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,039
a pack of chips when you're eating

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,080
explodes on your face

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,319
you'll be angry and you will start

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,319
well

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,199
insulting people uh something similar

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,240
happens

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,400
when the software explodes now

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
second aspects the second p would be

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
price so

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
we're used that when we buy something we

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,039
get uh

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
we have to pay some money in exchange

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
price goes much

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
beyond that actually something that we

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
have seen on the internet yeah something

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
uh worth

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,240
noting is that this marketing makes is

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,240
something from the 70s or 80s

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,960
well from before the internet um

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
but while they still apply it might be a

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,479
bit outdated in this regard

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,120
uh google without going much further

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,960
have shown us how uh money is not the

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
only price that you can pay when you're

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
using

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,039
uh a product you can pay with your data

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
for example

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,680
facebook actually it's been what the

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,440
internet has been about over the last

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,720
10 to 20 years at least right

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,360
but there are other prices as well uh

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,840
there is uh money there is security

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
there is

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,759
uh privacy uh it can also be

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
that you have to go through hoops

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,759
installing

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,440
harsh linux and then

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
all of that right and i think that at

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,840
the moment the price of using

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,759
well what we create is going

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
a bit along these lines that's my

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,639
opinion for sure

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,280
um we have a place

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,680
now when we buy the pack of chips the

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,560
place would be the supermarket right

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,000
uh when we talk about google services

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,080
it's probably google.com

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,560
or gmail or whatever i don't really know

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,560
for us what is it and actually uh if you

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
saw the kitty all about the abs talk if

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,719
you saw the weyland talk

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
i think that there is a lot of effort

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
that we're putting not just

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,880
kde but overall in the linux community

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,399
and free software community

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,560
to make this

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,560
place more defined and actually much

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,040
easier to reach because it has been

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,040
like i said earlier and also in my

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,240
opinion a bit complex

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,120
um especially given uh

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
the the premise has been in a lot of

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
cases

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,760
downloading weird things from websites

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
buying a com a computer with an

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,600
operating system and swapping it for

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,399
another one that is not really supported

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,760
this is a weird place to go to right

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,040
nevertheless it's there

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,399
it's working i am sure that out of the

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,600
70 many people who are in this room

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,399
a lot of us have done it uh

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
so it's not that bad and many of us

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,399
we're still

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
also well working on the alternatives

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
right for example the

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,120
kd slim book is also another way of

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,040
looking at that problem

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,080
the app stores are as well etc

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,519
and the last p is promotion now

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
we have a place we need to make sure

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,760
that people go into this place how to

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,880
make sure that this happens

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,760
for example we have the dots we have

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,120
a planet we have the talks that we go to

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,760
conferences and talk about what we do

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
we have the community the linux user

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
groups that are in every city and they

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
talk to their peers and

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,000
uh explain when our software would be

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
good for them

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
all of these are small pieces into this

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
promotion

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,600
machine that uh

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,720
that we are part of in the end podcasts

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,959
uh you we've all seen also like

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
these street signs for some projects i

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,560
remember seeing one from firefox

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,600
uh 10 years ago or so and i felt like it

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,760
was weird like

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,640
these logos are supposed to be only in

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,000
my laptop

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,120
but it wasn't the case anymore um

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,360
there's many ways of of doing this

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,399
writing books documentation can be also

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,920
part of promotion

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,760
it's also part of the product as well

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,120
everything is kind of connected and

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,120
works with with each other

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,120
now um

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,120
i've presented these four things i'm

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,560
gonna try i'm gonna do the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,200
my best effort into uh analyzing how uh

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,079
some of our software feeds in this

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,600
consumer

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,480
consumer centric centric wall and

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,640
and maybe we can see like not today i'm

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,680
not gonna tell you what to do right now

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,320
but we can see new ways where we can

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
work further like i said not like we're

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,800
doing something

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,440
terrible but we need to look into the

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,440
future right

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,839
something that uh brings

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,880
like writes my red light every time that

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,399
i see

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,600
is when i see maintainers developers

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
that don't really

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
take response responsibility of the

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,000
delivery process

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,000
this has admittedly not been

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,600
very easy to do up until recently but

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
technology has evolved a lot and

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
our infrastructure is also so much

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,079
better uh so that we can

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,320
start thinking about those things um

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,480
and someone who clearly has done this

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,839
very well is krita for example

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,440
now what do i mean by taking

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,120
responsibility of the creative to

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,760
deliver a process

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,360
well we have some people thinking about

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
how to create software what it's going

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,519
to look like

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,560
what it's going to feel like to the to

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,240
the user

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,279
um we need these people to be involved

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,839
into the well for one the

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,680
feedback that comes back from the user

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,200
uh to make sure that they can

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,200
um react when

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
something doesn't work like it should we

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,639
don't have to we cannot assume that

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,480
we're gonna do everything perfect

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:56,880
because in in this life nothing is

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
and so is in our software so

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,760
as part of this iteration uh process we

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
need to make sure that

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,200
the the people who are responsible in

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,279
the beginning can also be responsible in

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,399
the end something that has frustrated me

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,000
and i'm gonna give you an example it was

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
uh i think it was maybe 10 years ago

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,880
when

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,800
we were part of the brazilian education

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,560
um deployment we had a lot of people

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
using kde software over there

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,839
some were still scary edu apps some

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,959
others were

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,440
plasma but in the end what really

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,040
shocked me is that while we were having

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,199
like hundreds of millions of people

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,800
using the the software

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,079
the amount of feedback we got was still

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,720
quite minimal right and how was this

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,000
possible

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,040
well uh when talking to the organizers

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,040
of the deployment

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,880
they started to tell me about all of

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,600
these infrastructure that they had

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
to to get the feedback from the teachers

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
because

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,639
good reasons actually right like their

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,839
english wasn't that good

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,800
or they didn't feel like they were

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,120
technically

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,880
capable of of communicating with us

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
these are all things that we should make

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
sure

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,399
that stops being a problem over time if

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,920
you want to make sure

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
we want to be able to continue saying

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
that we care about users that we care

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,440
about

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:30,320
what people are doing and that we can

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:34,480
offer solutions for that

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,880
and the another very good example about

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,720
that

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,600
is kt connects where uh it has two sides

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
it has the

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,880
linux good side and then it has the

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
android side and when discussing the

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,199
development feature

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,560
the linux site always needs to be super

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,600
backwards compatible because

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,519
people who use debian will stay on an

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,279
old unmaintained version for many years

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,360
when android people will get an update

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,880
automatically from asdroid or google

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,120
play with the last version

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,279
which is the thing that has been uh

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,279
curated by by the maintainers

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,360
at any point so

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,760
it's really awkward that we have a

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,959
better uh

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,160
communication with our users on on

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,880
on on android and especially on google

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
play than

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,160
it is on actually the platforms that

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,560
we're comfortable with using and

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
actually we're telling people to use

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
i know that there's uh ways to improve

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,639
that

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,639
and many of us are working towards that

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
but i think that it would be very

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,279
important to make sure

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,079
that we keep this as uh

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,519
as an angle rather than that thing that

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,639
is happening

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,519
in parallel with my daily life because

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,440
in the end

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,440
if somebody has a problem they tell you

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,480
and you cannot uh well you can solve the

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
problem

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,839
but uh that person won't ever get the

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
the the fix or they will get the fix

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,639
eventually

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,399
there is a lot of uh frustration that

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,160
gets unresolved we need to make sure

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,079
that

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
frustration is not part of our daily

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,320
lives now

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,199
uh we need to make sure that we get to

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,160
do this as a team you have a lot of

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,600
people you can rely on

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,480
and but use them

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,839
talk to us talk to everyone and let's

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
make sure that

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
the issues get resolved and that you can

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,040
do what you

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,279
that you want now when thinking about

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,880
the kind of products we have we have

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,880
apps we have systems much like plasma

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,560
actually mostly plasma

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,480
and we have frameworks

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,839
which are kind of a weird product in

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,560
itself but actually it's a good

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,559
explanation of what we're talking about

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
uh an example of an app okay two

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,120
building i was talking about gig

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,039
earlier but uh

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,199
what is our our price the first pay

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,839
well the price of geared to burling is

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
mostly zero

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,240
euros and possibly

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
or you could do in a donation that's

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,079
kind of part of it you could hire

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,440
somebody if it's not doing somebody

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,559
something that you would like it to do

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,000
that's kind of it uh oh sorry

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,320
i was not the first piece still

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,320
uh

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
oh sorry i forgot the first pick was

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
this product what is the product

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,919
product is the app itself with the

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,559
whatever features it has

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
at the right moment the place well the

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,919
place actually it will

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,440
depend a lot on the platform you're on

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,720
if you're

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,880
in android it will be

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,919
either android or google play i actually

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
think that

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,679
ktuberling is in google play or at least

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,679
it was some sometime in the past

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
if you're on windows it should be the

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
windows store probably or downloading

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,280
msi files i don't know i don't really

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,720
use windows at all but if i was uh okay

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,400
turbulent maintainer

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,000
i would have to get involved in that if

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,520
i want my windows users to be

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,280
to be happy and that's a good if right

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,280
you you can decide that you don't care

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,200
about something but then you need to be

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,400
conscious about it you cannot

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,400
say i'm gonna hope that

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,000
somebody packages my application and

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,679
hope for the best because it should work

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,799
and actually probably will just work

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
but you need to know where your

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,240
application is being used that and then

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,360
on linux at the moment

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,320
well the answer is very very

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,559
diverse on debian will be apt or

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,440
probably also flat packs like snap

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,360
flat by snap should work somewhat on

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
everywhere

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
um well it depends also it's important

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
to

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,480
remember that we need to to focus on

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,360
those

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,039
because we cannot have every maintainer

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,080
supporting everything ever

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
right and then last would be promotion

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,720
which would be

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,320
well the planet everyone remember the

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,960
plan is super important

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
whatever you say there reaches a lot of

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,600
people

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,000
uh use it now

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,000
i hear i have just one minute i'm gonna

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,280
go through plasma very quickly

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
or actually i'm not i am going to leave

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,320
you uh

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
the the task of of doing it yourself you

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,080
can do the process i think that it's

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
it's an

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,559
interesting

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,000
thought process to do and

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,000
you will learn from it

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
use the team you don't need to work

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,520
alone actually if you're working alone

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,320
it's probably because you're doing

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,160
something wrong don't do it

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,320
spread your work there's people who will

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,679
be interested in some parts specifically

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,760
use that for for your uh

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,360
in your advantage do not blame if

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,640
something is not working especially

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,799
since you control

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
the process it's something that you can

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:17,120
fix we are relying only on free software

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,559
and as a team we should be able to solve

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,720
any of the problems if something is not

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,600
working on cute it's not acceptable to

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,600
tell a user

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
this is not working on cute if something

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,919
is not working on cute you send the

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
pipes to cute

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,000
and enjoy your life and when i'm talking

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,400
about cube it can be any part of our

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,720
stack

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,679
frameworks it can be linux it can be

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,880
whatever

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,760
all right and thank you sorry for being

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
a bit over time

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,159
uh thank you alesh uh you're almost

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,200
perfectly in time we still have four

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,480
minutes left or for questions

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
and if we look into the shared notes

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,960
there's actually

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
four questions so uh we have one minute

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
each

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
um the first one is uh what do you think

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,360
about

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,679
lenovo or dell selling linux laptops

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,280
i think it's great it's something

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
actually i think that it should be the

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,000
right place for

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,919
for plasma at the moment though

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
plasma is not available over there

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,240
something that

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,600
should be worked on i guess and actually

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,840
the whole conversation about

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,840
how that should happen would be really

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,280
interesting it's not straightforward but

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,200
i think that we should strive

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,039
to go in this direction it doesn't need

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
to be the big manufacturers either

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,559
i think that the important thing is to

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,960
have something

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,360
that we can tell people to use right um

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
slim book has been a good first uh case

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,039
for that there might be

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,080
others there are others yeah um

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,880
the second question is uh

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,440
what do you think about the teddy bears

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
uh

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,799
something like getting uh normal users

00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,200
from twitter to mastodon

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,960
i don't really have a strong opinion i

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,480
have to i try to be part of

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,240
of every of these networks because i

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,200
think that it's the right place to be on

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
they admittedly cannot really put all of

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,159
my effort over there

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,640
because what i care about is actually

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,520
people using free software people about

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,919
using our software enjoying our software

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
and

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,360
i am not going to put myself in the

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,400
position of going somewhere where people

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,679
are not around

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,400
ask adu though if we if

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,320
you care about the federers i would

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,480
encourage you to join the kitty promo

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,600
group i am sure that they will

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,480
embrace you with a smile and let you

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
do what you care about

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,159
okay then the next question is a bit

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
longer um

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,520
something that has worked for other

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
communities to improve their product

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,919
focus

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,760
um is to get their their is to get to

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,559
know their users by survey

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,320
surveying them with simple questions to

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,799
guide prioritization

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,440
um as a free software community we can

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,000
ask

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,919
of our users input better than a bug

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,760
tracker or reddit already

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,320
those tools fail to quantify the

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,559
tendencies i feel asking

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
what is working for you where is your

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,120
software

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,840
letting you down etc could guide us

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,600
do you think that could help us i think

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,640
that it's it's super important actually

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,600
earlier this year we worked actually

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
with volker

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,799
who's sharing key user feedback which is

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,000
actually

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,200
all about that we haven't really used

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,240
all of the potential

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,559
and actually the polling uh

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
thing you're asking about is actually

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,320
part of it

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,799
when when we do it we will do our best

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
to

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,480
ask the right questions i think that

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,559
it's it's very important especially

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
because we don't want to only work for

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,520
the people who are having problems i

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
think that it's very important to know

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,120
what

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,120
makes people happy about what we do and

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,880
not have this bias of

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,080
whatever is not working is what

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
is important because it's not always the

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,039
case and we might be losing

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,440
opportunities over there

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,840
but also again if you're interested in

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,039
working on that

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
join us and say this is gonna be my my

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,840
turf right

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,760
okay then the last question still fits

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,159
in um

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
how do you see neon fitting into the

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,440
idea of

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,640
kde taking more responsibility for

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,520
connecting directly with users

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
i think that neon has already done a lot

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,039
in this

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,880
in this direction i remember telling

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,000
years ago

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,840
jonathan and harold about how

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,840
i was getting a lot more feedback on

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,039
discover which is some software that i

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,360
have been working on since long time uh

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,880
from from neon that i was getting from

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,559
any of the other distros

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,960
and actually at that moment neon was

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,480
just starting right so people

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,760
were not well there weren't that many

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,600
people back then

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,600
as they are right now using neon

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,120
there could be more i guess the linux

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,919
ecosystem is a very complex i i am not

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,760
going to

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,120
be telling people what it should look

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,200
like i know what i want

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,960
and i think that if you've listened to

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,279
me you will

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,960
kind of get an idea i don't think that

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,840
actually neon is

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,679
the end goal uh but i think that it's

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,159
definitely a very interesting tool

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,240
right now if i want to tell people i

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,799
need you to test this feature on

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
on on plasma i think that it's probably

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,840
one of the

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,720
best ways to do so but there are others

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,039
there's

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,320
opensuse tumbleweed it's also an

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,520
interesting

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:57,840
way to do it and
