Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	In KDE we create a myriad of things for different kind of people. We create frameworks, we create applications, we create environments. And we create it for different kind of people be it other people like us, high school students, 3rd party developers, distribution packagers and more than we can imagine (really!).

In this presentation I would like to offer a framework to explain how we can embrace philosophies and ultimately technologies to make sure the Free Software community and its users are best taken care of.
