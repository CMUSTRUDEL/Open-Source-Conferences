Title: Akademy 2020 - Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen & Andrew Shoben - KDE Wags Your Tail
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	Find out how The Tail Company worked with KDE technologies to make their tails wag and ears wiggle, how they realised they already had a Free Software mindset, and see under the skin of their hardware.

In the autumn of 2018, The Tail Company decided that a simple remote control was not enough for what they wanted to do with their animatronic tails, and they launched a crowd funding campaign to build a bluetooth based app controlled one. This presentation is the tale of how this turned into an experiment of working directly with the free software community, with all of the control software based on free software and KDE's Kirigami framework. Since then, the increasingly unfortunately named Tail Company has launched their animatronic ears, EarGear, controlled by the same software. You will also be able to see underneath the skin of both, to see an overview of how the app works across different platforms, and how the tail and ear hardware is put together.
