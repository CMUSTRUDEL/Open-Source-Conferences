Title: Akademy 2020 - Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen & Andrew Shoben - KDE Wags Your Tail
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	Find out how The Tail Company worked with KDE technologies to make their tails wag and ears wiggle, how they realised they already had a Free Software mindset, and see under the skin of their hardware.

In the autumn of 2018, The Tail Company decided that a simple remote control was not enough for what they wanted to do with their animatronic tails, and they launched a crowd funding campaign to build a bluetooth based app controlled one. This presentation is the tale of how this turned into an experiment of working directly with the free software community, with all of the control software based on free software and KDE's Kirigami framework. Since then, the increasingly unfortunately named Tail Company has launched their animatronic ears, EarGear, controlled by the same software. You will also be able to see underneath the skin of both, to see an overview of how the app works across different platforms, and how the tail and ear hardware is put together.

[Music]

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,200
okay

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,119
let me click this button here okay so um

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
we haven't got very long in fact uh

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,960
we've got five minutes less than we

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,279
thought

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,640
so i'm going to um compress what i was

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,000
going to talk about really into sort of

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,920
two parts

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,359
um i'm an artist i'm a sculptor and um

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
i was part of a group of artists still

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,920
am in fact called grey world and we make

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,680
public art

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
usually in urban spaces and we've been

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,120
doing this for a very long time

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
about 25 years um it's

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,719
i'm going to whiz through that a little

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
bit because it's important just very

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,719
quickly to understand

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
why we ended up creating tails and

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
animatronic ears

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
why that might be something where it

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
comes from actually the journey very

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
very briefly the journey that we just

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,520
got in discovery really because it turns

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
out

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,879
that there are lots and lots of reasons

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,199
why people want to wear tails and ears

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,520
and i

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
i my set of reasons are are mine and

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
unique to me but there are many people

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
with very different

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,720
other kinds of uh you know interests so

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,159
very very briefly let me skip this

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,240
forward um

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,200
uh i'm professor of public art at

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
goldsmiths

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,479
uh university of london um what that

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,479
really entails is ways in which we

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,320
investigate and play with different ways

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,759
of interacting in public space

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
so i'm really interested in the

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
methodology the ways in which

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
simple interaction can create something

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
fantastic or fabulous

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
memorable um something fleeting

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
something ephemeral and these are the

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
kinds of things that

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,400
that we research um if you think about

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,680
it grey world really is the

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
is a thing that i've been spending most

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
of my time with for a long time and

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,479
the professorship was an interesting way

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
of actually sort of going a little bit

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,560
deeper

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,079
and i set up gray order in 93 the first

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
interactive artwork that i did and this

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,240
will give you

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
a start start to give you a flavor of

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
the kind of things that i'm personally

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,920
interested in

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
you know when you're a child and you

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
pick up a stick and you run it along

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,600
railings

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
and get that lovely sound we took a set

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,560
of railings and we tuned them

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
so when you ran a stick along it it

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,440
played the girl from epinema

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,239
now from my point of view what that is

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
as a public

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
work of art is important but it's just

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,280
as important as what it isn't you know

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
isn't some big bronze statue with a you

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,319
know

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,280
uh traffic cone on his head it's a

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,319
method of creating

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
interaction so um over the years we've

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,160
made lots of different projects and i'm

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
going to

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
gloss through these very quickly if

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
you're interested please go to

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
greyworld.org

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
you can see hundreds of hundreds of

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
projects but

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
let me start by showing you some some

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
quick videos

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
of some projects that we've done let's

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,400
see if this works

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,760
of course it's going to work i'm going

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
to show a video by clicking on this

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
little thing down here

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,360
actions is that right there we are

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,319
sharing external video

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,319
paste it in there and hit go

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
after two centuries of trading at the

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,239
same site in the city of london

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,640
the stock exchange is moving to a

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,640
striking new home next to st

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,400
after two of each other two centuries of

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,959
trading at the same site in the city of

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
london

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,000
the stock exchange is moving to a

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
striking new home

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
next to saint paul's cathedral the queen

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,360
opened the building today

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,519
with all eyes on the rather beguiling

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
work of art which forms the centerpiece

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,599
of the new stock exchanges june kelly

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,239
now explains

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,040
this is an eight-story home please don't

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,040
worry terrified

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
it was perhaps one of the most unusual

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,879
limitations the queen has ever received

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,040
she pressed one electronic ball and more

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,680
than 700 others suspended on metal

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
cables

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
began to move the balls are the

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,000
centerpiece and talking point of the new

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,200
stock exchange building

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
what we've tried to do with this

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,080
sculpture is create something which

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
makes physical

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,200
the ephemeral nature of the stock market

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,959
for many it's a

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
very what i'm trying to do there is to

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
make physical what is to many people a

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,239
completely mysterious thing i mean the

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
stock markets trades go up and down

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
we tried to make a 3d sculpture a

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
sculpture which you can model almost

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
anything

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,040
by sending those spheres fears to

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,319
different parts of the atrium i'm going

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,519
to whisper i could talk about just that

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,680
one for about a month but

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,799
i think you might you might all just uh

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,599
want to kill yourself so i'm going to

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,199
show you something else really quickly

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,639
apple city click on here down here

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,440
stop sharing external video sharing some

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,800
video here we go

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,759
paste it in there this is another

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
kind of interactive work uh this is a

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,040
project called paint

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,400
um let's see if it will start playing

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:42,080
[Music]

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:45,120
is it playing for you guys okay great

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
a photograph of yourself and work that

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,050
photograph into it

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,100
into a bucket and then hurl your face

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,100
[Music]

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,960
of course other people with those

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
buckets can

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,829
[Music]

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:22,209
[Music]

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:39,840
um

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:39,840
basically the brand was very very keen

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
okay

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,600
okay let me show you another one um

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,080
there's another another another one

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,520
basically

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,120
we um i've always wanted to make a

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
rainbow

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,880
and i wanted to make the biggest

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,039
brightest

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,319
gayest rainbow i could possibly make to

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
celebrate

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
and so we decided to create uh something

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,490
over the house of parliament in the

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,629
center of london

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,629
[Music]

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,840
we put the water from

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:32,550
[Music]

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:44,000
[Music]

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,520
okay sorry there's so many things that i

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
could show but really what i wanted to

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,520
get across

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,039
is the idea that our work is about play

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,240
it's about uh often gentle methods of

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,560
interaction

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
and creating situations which are

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
playful

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,280
but also give you a sense of being

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
creative in some way um

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
you've seen the the things that are

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
actually not going to show gravity after

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,319
all but

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,759
um and that leads leads me to

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,000
details you know um

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,440
it's been amazing i just wanted to have

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
a tail i've always wanted to have a tail

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,479
i think evolution has been particularly

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
cruel in that regard

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,199
you know um when i look at my cat

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
and i wonder what's going on in his mind

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
it's often his tail

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
which really gives me the sense of his

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,599
mood and for me

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
the experiments with tails really

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,599
started off as a grey world installation

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,800
they were opportunities to create really

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,479
interesting and exciting little creative

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
moments in a city

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,280
so you can imagine for example uh

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
being well dressed and going into the

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
bank but having your tail not the

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
pencils off

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
when you're applying for an overdraft or

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,520
you can imagine

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
sitting next to somebody that you you're

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,599
attracted to and whilst you're

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,319
unable to actually express yourself your

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
tale

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,599
is making it very clear that you're

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
particularly interested in the person

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,080
that you're sitting next to

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,800
for me it was a wonderful extension of

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,319
humanity really but also it was an

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,759
opportunity to create little

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
special moments that perhaps you

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,680
wouldn't be able to create without one

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,440
and so the tail company was born it

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,840
started off as an installation for

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,160
with great as i say um let me just show

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,840
you our first prototype

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,800
let's see if this works um

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,320
click the button paste the link like

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,599
that

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
so this is our first prototype this is

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,320
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,120
and you might have noticed i'm not shy

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
the original outfit idea was top hat

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,680
this is without doubt the coolest part

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
of confidence

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
is

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,680
i've just watched this guy walking apart

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:37,839
okay

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,839
that's how cool

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,360
we were very interested in that that

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,240
opportunity that creative opportunity

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
every time i showed the tale every time

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,800
i did

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,040
a talk or a speech wearing a tail

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
or in an urban space people kept saying

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
i want to tell

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,079
i i've always wanted a tale i had to

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
tell when i was a kid i made one out of

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,160
some material and i suddenly realized it

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
was a kind of universal feeling that for

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,920
many people

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,000
it was a childhood thing and for some

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,560
far more than we can probably imagine

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
it's something that that is still there

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,200
into into adulthood and i was delighted

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
to hear this

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,880
we set up the chat the tower company and

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,399
um yeah we ended up with

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,360
with um with a business um and

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,640
so let me just show you this let's see

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
which one i've chosen

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
okay so this is just a a selection of

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,839
tails

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,320
um not not that many i just kind of

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
edited it together

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
the original tails were remote

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,839
controlled

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
uh they have nine moves and you can call

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
them up on a remote

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,279
um and i was absolutely blessed

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,920
to to to meet linear who allowed us

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,720
really to

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,079
take that into a new direction and open

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,519
up all the possibilities that the

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,320
software would give us

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,760
um let me just show you what i mean by

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
that

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,560
by copying this one there's a

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
you know we can basically our tails the

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,839
digitals which are are the app

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
control tails which linear wrote um

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
can learn new tricks that at the moment

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,079
we're just adding the feature so that as

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,880
you walk

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,600
the tail can work out your speed and

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
your motion

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
and create moves based on that on the

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
fly um

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
recently we've added move alarms and

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
we've added all kinds of

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
uh new things and that's the wonderful

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,720
thing about breaking out of

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,639
of the hardware there and allowing big

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
brains to come along and solve some

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
other problems

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
and most recently of all coming of time

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,600
two minutes over

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
um most recent of all we've started

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
playing

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,399
with ears which i'm just going to show

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,839
you this

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,839
beautifully they sync with the tails

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:27,110
[Music]

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
great guitar player too so the point is

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
um

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,320
it's an ecosystem to use that cheesy

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,000
word but it really is if you've got

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,279
digital and you've got the ears

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,680
they can now sync together um they are

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,880
uh something that that is being actively

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,399
developed i mean

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,760
they're out now people are getting them

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,279
getting them and there's things that we

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
will keep adding and adding and adding

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,800
changing

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,040
things to them as as life goes on but

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,760
it's been a real um

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,560
a really exciting little journey so far

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,519
and um

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,480
as i say thanks to linear and uh their

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,720
skills

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
um and uh their understanding of kd

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
which i'm sure

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,120
and and the blockchain this system check

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
a line of software i think we're going

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,760
to

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
have a very interesting kind of future

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,880
if anybody is interested

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
in getting hold of them please put the

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,959
word kde talk

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
in the box on the checkout if you are

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
interested

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
if you do i will put some special

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
presents in there only for people who've

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,800
sat ahead

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,279
and handled me for 12 minutes okay so

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
i'm going to

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,600
i'm going to hand over to labia right

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
now

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,959
all yours mate all right let me just uh

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,519
see if i can do this

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:42,959
take presenter all right there we go

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,320
right so um

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,560
some of you will already know me but

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,519
i'll quickly run through who i am

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,480
um i have been a member of the kd

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,120
community since

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,279
as about as long as i can really

00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,240
remember doing computery things but

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:03,199
since 2002 my first academy was in 2007

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,920
which was in glasgow of all places i

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,360
have tales

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
come and talk um

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,480
and sort of my main work

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,880
has been through uh the unfortunately

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
now

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,959
defunct gluon but

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,199
many things came out of that so there's

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,480
a whole lot of stuff

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,519
which grew out of gluon which is now

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:35,199
in all sorts of places throughout

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,199
um used throughout kd's software stack

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,199
and yeah

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,240
my uh main interaction uh all my

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,800
my day job right now is with uh blue

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,199
systems and effectively i'm sponsored to

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
work

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,279
on various bits of the kde

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
uh software stack most notably that

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,120
would be

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,240
kirigami which we use for the

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,920
app that controls these things i'm

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,880
also the maintainer of peruse

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,399
which is a comic book reader and uh i

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,760
have just been told that i should take

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,800
over maintainership of k

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,800
new stuff um which is

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,839
uh the software that lets us interact

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,959
directly with the

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,920
kde store um and

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,720
uh occasionally i look like that which

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,160
is kind of how i ended up

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,279
in contact with the uh with andrew

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,560
and um and his entire thing

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,720
so uh

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:52,399
the way i found my way into this was

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,040
you know you look through kickstarter

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
and go

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,199
oh that looks kind of cool is it a thing

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,199
i don't know oh wait it is a thing it's

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,079
an actual thing that someone has made

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,160
and that it actually works so that's

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,000
neat

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,800
this thing um and

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,199
wait the people that run it are pretty

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,040
cool

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,959
you know you've just seen all of the

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,959
stuff uh

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,480
yeah that that andrew has been involved

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,480
with before and all of

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
you know you you know present yourself

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
on kickstarter that's the sort of thing

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,519
you find so

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,240
you know people with you know will and

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,480
skill

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,759
and intention and all of that so you

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,880
know perfect storm of good

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,079
good ideas um and then so i joined the

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
telegram chat and

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,440
we got to talking about so what are you

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
going to do with the software and how we

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
don't really know yet we've you know

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,600
we've heard of this thing called

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,920
electron

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,199
which if anybody here has worked with

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,199
that it's basically

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:54,320
a browser that you use to

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,360
you know you you stick it you clone

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,800
chromium

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,399
and then you stick that in and in a

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
container and you use that to write your

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,400
apps

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,079
and it can be fine for many things but

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,199
the problem is

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
the or the biggest functional problem

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
with that

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,000
is if you've got a phone and you put it

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,720
to sleep

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,079
um any electron app will also go to

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
sleep so there's no real

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,280
way of having that sort of thing run in

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,799
the background so

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,480
there would have been quite a lot of

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,679
work involved in getting

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,520
that to work in any reasonable way

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
an electron would not have helped there

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,039
and so i suggested

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,679
um well we've kind of got a software

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,120
stack that can do a lot of this stuff so

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,600
do you want some help um and then

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
uh well i guess i could help out with it

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,720
a bit

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
uh and so you know that thing where

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,960
you're building hardware

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,600
uh you're not really building software

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,320
so how about we make it a gpl

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,080
project and that took like i don't know

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,640
was it five minutes it took you to

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
realize that

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,960
something like that it was pretty fast

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,160
anyway yeah i mean obviously

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,080
uh free software being this kind of

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,280
um liberal arts sort of thing to start

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,640
with it you know it it makes

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,400
perfect sense it sort of just

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,960
fits together really well um

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,960
and so that's how you know we ended up

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,080
doing that whole thing

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
and so that's a couple of screenshots of

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,679
what the app looks like

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,039
um if you want a closer look i'll give

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,720
you one but

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,840
uh we're running through a little bit

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,200
quick here so

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,960
yeah exactly

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,640
um so just a quick list of the things

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,799
that we are already using

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
if you want to know more about how to

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,080
work with kde software on

00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,760
android and how kde

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,919
stack helps that um there is a talk

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,200
in this room immediately after hours

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
except you know a few

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,640
hours down the line i think it's at five

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,919
o'clock uh oh wait

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,120
yeah whatever the next talk uh in this

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
room

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,559
is is specifically about that so

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,840
drop by there it's really good um

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,919
and so a couple of specifics for the

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
actual things we use obviously we use

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,200
the

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,039
um the android build docker because

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,280
working with android studio is

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,720
occasionally something of a nightmare

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,720
um so we're using that one to build

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,080
all of our things the android services

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,520
are the things that

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,360
make it possible for this to be off

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,559
and still control the ears and the tail

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,360
um and that's the way you do that

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,480
is using remote objects or the easiest

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
way to do it anyway

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,520
um and

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,280
then obviously for the ui and the

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,480
workflow and all of the pretty things we

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,440
use kirigami

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,000
and the breeze i can set and it's one of

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
those

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,880
things where i am unsure

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,559
whether people realize just how much

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
power is in having a gigantic set of

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,080
icons like

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:29,120
breeze um when you're building software

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,960
it makes an enormous difference when you

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,200
don't have to go out and

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,159
get you know icons drawn and all of that

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,159
so yeah

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,440
definitely something people will need to

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,919
look at

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,880
um and it's something that we can market

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,039
to

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,720
people out there so yeah very helpful

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,320
um and then there's a couple of future

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,520
bits of work here

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,679
uh and one of the so i'm just

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,440
going to leave that on there and mention

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,640
k new stuff because of course i am i'm

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,400
not going to go through a talk but i'm

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,520
not mentioning k new stuff

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,799
so one thing that we did when we came up

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,960
with uh how to make the ears do their

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,480
thing was that we created a small domain

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,159
specific language to

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,760
describe the ways these things wiggle

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,960
um and that's just a text file

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,919
uh which is json and can be put anywhere

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,840
uh really and the sort of i the sort of

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,480
semi-midterm kind of idea for that is

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,159
that we would like to eventually

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,200
um make that make it possible to stick

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,720
to share the moves and things that these

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,440
things do

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,080
um and so okay new stuff is the obvious

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
choice for that we already have all of

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,320
uh all of the functionality there so

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,840
we've got the store for it we've you

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,960
know we've got all the server-side stuff

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,080
we've got

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
uh the um yeah yeah we've got all the

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,640
bits

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,679
that make that work so yeah

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,080
um and then it was very

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,000
short i think we might want to skip that

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,480
because we're now 22 minutes

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,280
yeah and you're doing it ably anyway

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,080
sure oh yeah i'm just holding i'm

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,520
holding this little thing here

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,159
what i'd really like to do as well is

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,919
just for one ten seconds just to say

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
uh thank you to the people who've

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,120
supported us especially

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,120
dark grew tatsui seki

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,480
a lot of this is made reflected back

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
altered changed and and put back out

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,080
there so we can't really do this at all

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,440
in a bubble uh this is the nature of

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,960
open source

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,280
yeah yeah there's a lot of

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,080
interaction although it goes in various

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,720
different directions

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,280
awesome stuff uh i think we have now two

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
minutes for

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,280
questions and you uh do feel free to

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,320
demo in the meantime i mean

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,320
just entertain them

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,039
yeah well i have i have effectively been

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,600
demoing the whole time i have not

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,720
i haven't touched the phone since we

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,080
started

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
um but

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,039
so one of the things that you'll notice

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,000
on this

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,000
is where it says

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:34,640
digital connected to uh

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,200
yeah that's a thing that we'll need to

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,320
fix it says i'm connected to your tail

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,159
this is not a tail so obviously

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,919
bugs and people notice these things so

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,320
that's you know getting fixed the

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,279
next version but one of the things that

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,159
means is that's

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,120
how android allows you to run stuff in

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
the background

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
that's right

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
fantastic mode called casual mode which

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,480
means you're not sitting there with a

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,000
phone in your hand making it do stuff

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,559
i'm feeling in this particular kind of

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,919
emotion you can collect a set of moves

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,600
stick it in your pocket and go about

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,960
your life and that was very that's

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,120
casual mode

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,120
all right the question you guys have is

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,919
actually how do you teach them new

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,440
movements

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,520
mlai new additions in the code data

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,760
well linear is actually just as a

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,919
language now which you can use to create

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,960
moves and that was a bit of a mind

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,480
blower i mean for us

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,080
it was more hardware how you move the

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,000
servos how they use

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,600
so they have now developed that into a

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,760
into a kind of a scripting language

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,799
which allows you to describe them

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,360
and let those moves live so it's very

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,320
the future technically speaking it's a

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,320
json file

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,039
uh but yeah it's a very small list of

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,919
commands that you send over bluetooth

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,120
that makes

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,919
them do things awesome

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,240
i hope many people will get one try it

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,120
so good luck you guys that's so awesome

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,440
thanks for watching us here so actually

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,120
thank you very much everybody

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,600
yeah um so we are out of time for this

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
talk

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,440
uh right now this room is empty though

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
so we are actually technically not in a

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,880
super

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,840
huge hurry uh thanks again for the fun

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,120
presentation i really enjoyed it i think

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,120
everybody else did too um yeah over at

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:29,360
the other room we have

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:31,840
something what's coming up

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,400
yeah we have uh three lightning talks

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,840
coming up

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
virtual sprints the fiduciary license

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
agreement

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,840
i can't pronounce that but something

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,360
like that and super simple enough

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,320
features after that we will have a lunch

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,240
break

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,240
which is quite a long break since we

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,120
want to accommodate different time zones

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,960
a bit

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,400
um we will have another round of

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,559
four-way track experience

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,039
so we were after the session finishes

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,960
uh try some experiments uh meet up in a

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,080
room and have casual chit chat

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,520
uh so i hope everybody will stick around

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,600
we'll have a new room for that

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,840
uh announce that after the lightning

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,159
talks

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,159
yeah thank you so much for joining here
