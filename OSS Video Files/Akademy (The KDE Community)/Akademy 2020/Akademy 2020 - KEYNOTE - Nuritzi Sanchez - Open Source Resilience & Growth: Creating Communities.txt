Title: Akademy 2020 - KEYNOTE - Nuritzi Sanchez - Open Source Resilience & Growth: Creating Communities
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	Even without the added pressure of this pandemic, established open source projects like KDE and GNOME must find ways to be resilient and continue to grow. Come learn about how to take this challenge on and help make KDE stronger with each year to come.

During this keynote, we'll talk about some of the initiatives that KDE is involved in already that are helping make it more resilient, and identify some areas of opportunity. We'll also explore topics around building more diverse and inclusive communities, like collaborative communication, and ideas for outreach, in order to facilitate future growth.

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
source resilience and

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,680
growth basically how to create

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,680

my name is naritzi sanchez and

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
i am a senior open source program

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,199
manager

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,920
at gitlab i joined there in february

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,600
and before that i was actually one of

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
the founding team members at

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
endless which is a company that created

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,039
a linux based

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,439
operating system for users with little

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,600
to no access to internet

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,960
and that's how i got introduced to free

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
and open source software

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,799
um and how i got introduced actually to

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,840
the gnome community

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,159
and i ended up contributing more to that

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
and am a former president and

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,479
chairperson

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,400
at the gnome foundation and i also

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
wanted to include a little bit about my

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
academic background since

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
i don't know if it's as common to find

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
in free and open source software

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
i studied international relations and

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,280
psychology

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,079
in undergraduate and that's the lens

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
through which i

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,360
see the world all right

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
so in this talk i'm going to be covering

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,119
a few different topics

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
the first half of this presentation is

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,960
going to be about resilience and growth

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,960
and some opportunities that i see for

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,600
the kde foundation and really all

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,680
open source software projects and then

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,360
the second half of this presentation

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
is going to be about collaborative

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,520
communication because

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
i think it's really a really important

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
skill to

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,959
build

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,360
okay so uh

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,200
resilience and growth um basically this

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,160
year has been really tough

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,239
and it's included us all our personal

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,840
lives our professional lives and

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,560
our open source communities

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
there has been a pandemic there have

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
been

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,040
wildfires there have been

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,680
issues with racial and social justice

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,760
we've had to change our perspective

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
and there's been uh through the black

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
lives matter

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
um you know fight through lots of issues

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,959
um that are being surfaced in all areas

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,879
of our personal professional life um and

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,680
there's mass unemployment

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,319
and in our open source organizations

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,400
there's

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,640
uh the lack of in-person events has

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
really changed things for us

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,080
it means that we haven't had as many

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,080
hackathons or sprints

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
that are vital to the progress of our

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
projects

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,879
and our human connection aspect has

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
somewhat suffered

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,239
and that it's been great to be part of

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
this virtual conference

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
and chatting is really fun i've seen you

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,000
know some really funny

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,599
conversations happen but it would be a

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
whole other level to meet you all in

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,080
person

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,840
and so uh what i wanted to talk about is

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,440
just

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,720
resilience and it means the ability to

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,519
bounce back

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,920
and when looking through the american

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,319
psychological association's website i

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
found

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,760
this framework that they have about

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,720
resilience

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,760
and how you have to take time and really

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,560
be intentional

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
about building each of these four focus

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
areas

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
which are meaning wellness healthy

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,200
thinking

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,560
and connection and so i wanted to

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,439
take this lens and apply it to

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,120
the kde community and open source

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
communities in general

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
so really see what kind of opportunities

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,159
we have

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,880
in each of these focus areas

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
um and before i move on i just wanted to

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,239
see

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
if you all are having problems with

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,919
latency in my talk

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
uh slides because i'm getting quite a

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,560
bit of

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,840
lag any

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,320
looking at the public chat it seems good

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,639
it seems okay okay great so i'll keep

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,639
going

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,479
all right and please forgive me if you

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
hear me pause for a little bit because i

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
see a blank slide

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,600
okay so the first focus area

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
is meaning and for that it's really

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
about

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,919
helping your community understand why it

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,720
is that we're all here

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,160
and to that effect i think the kde does

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,560
a really good job

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,759
it has a very clear and powerful vision

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,720
um clearly stated on a web page

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
it says that kde imagines a world in

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
which

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
everyone has control over their digital

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,320
life and enjoys freedom

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,039
and privacy and they also have a

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
mission statement where it provides

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,720
in-depth

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,479
information on how to actually achieve

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,440
that vision statement

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
and so i think that is a fantastic start

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,919
and i think that there's an opportunity

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,400
to keep

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
bringing that meaning to more people and

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
so i see an opportunity around

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,960
building the brand the marketing and

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,960
doing more outreach to the community

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,360
and i love this quote by robert mckee

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,000
that really says that storytelling

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
is the most powerful way to put ideas

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,720
into the world today

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,720
and i think that um you know early on

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,199
a lot of floss projects started off with

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,520
really strong developer communities

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,440
we've started to see the importance of

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,440
building out other aspects

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,479
um bringing in other skill sets and i'd

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,120
like to encourage

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,000
kde and us all to keep moving in that

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
direction

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
i think it's awesome that they've

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
employed

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,639
contractors to help with brand and

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,039
marketing and community

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,160
this event is being run by incredible

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,319
organizers some of which are paid staff

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
and i think that that's a really great

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
way to

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,199
ensure that the project is resilient and

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
continues to

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,600
to grow

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,960
the next focus area is wellness and

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
when i think of wellness in the open

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,400
source sense i think about

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,039
measuring the health of the community

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
and at the gnome foundation i know that

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,919
we haven't done

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,680
um a lot of uh data collection partly

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
because of privacy concerns

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
and i think that kde is similar where

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
it's either you know there were real

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,240
concerns to be

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,080
um and challenges that we face

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
um and then part of it is just like

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,520
maybe we don't have the skill set or

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
expertise to really

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
put this in place and so i think that

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
this is an

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,919
area where we can all grow is um because

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,520
people want to understand the projects

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
that they're engaged with

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,440
for example companies need to understand

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,599
the value of the project

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,639
and the impact that their contributions

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,680
make

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,919
and open source foundations like kde

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,520
can evaluate the impact that their

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,880
programs that their work

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,479
is is having as they

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,960
respond to their communities needs

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,400
and so the opportunity here is to start

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,880
measuring our success

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,599
and measuring our community's health we

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,919
all have

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,000
annual reports where we do but this is

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,400
taking it to the next level

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
and for that there is a project that

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,599
exists today

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,720
called the chaos project if you haven't

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,440
heard about it

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
please check it out it is focused on

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,479
developing

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
metrics and practices to help

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,599
organizations

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,080
measure their community's health and kde

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,160
and gnome are collaborating on setting

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,280
on creating a set of metrics

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,440
specifically for our foundations

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
uh i'm part of the working group it's

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,080
called the app ecosystem working group

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
it's an

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
open you know group to join so if you'd

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
like to

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,759
check us out i've included a link there

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,800
and uh if you were part of another open

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,039
source project

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,200
i encourage you again to check out chaos

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,959
because i think it's a really

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,839
great um thing to to look into as we

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,839
continue to mature our organizations

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,240
the next factor is healthy thinking and

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,279
to me this is all about

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,760
policies and programs and kind of like

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,080
how we are enabling our community from a

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,640
high level perspective

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
and i love that kde's mission statement

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,519
includes this

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
people-centric um bit it says that in

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,399
order to promote

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,279
the development of free and open source

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,640
software kde maintains a diverse

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,399
inclusive and safe community so kde is

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,360
specifically calling this out that the

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,279
people aspect is important

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,640
and i think that's that's important

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,760
because it

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,200
then enables you to fund projects or

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,399
programs that are specific

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,399
to helping make sure that that happens

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
as i mentioned before paid staff i think

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
that that's a really important thing to

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,399
consider

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
and that could be full-time or

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,760
contractors but i think that

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,800
having somebody there that sees the uh

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,600
you know organization evolve that um

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
is paid and dedicated to the project is

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
um

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,120
you know to work on the project is

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,640
really important

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,760
um we at gnome have um even hired a

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,040
full-time

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,920
developer to work on gtk and um you know

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,440
other aspects

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,880
assist admin um were look

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
we have somebody who's helping with

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,399
fundraising all that kind of stuff

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,480
um and so i think that um you know

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
we're still in the experimental phase at

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,519
gnome in terms of understanding

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,640
um you know how how many people

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
to employ and all that kind of stuff um

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,320
but i think it's a really important step

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,920
to be taking

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,440
and then sustainability in general uh

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
one of the things here is that i i'm not

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,200
sure that we

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,519
do a great job of collaborating

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
with others to the degree that we could

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,040
be collaborating

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
um i was part of this organization

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,839
called fast responders

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,120
that came into being to support

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,640
organizations

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,640
during cobit 19 because um you know

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
because of the lack of in-person events

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
we thought that they would be

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,760
that projects would be financially

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,079
impacted and i was just amazed at

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,519
how many amazing people there from like

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,600
the python foundation

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,800
and drupal association and all these

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
other ones that

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
i know you know i know that they're

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,600
there i know that ex

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,519
that they exist and we need it um events

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
but we don't do enough collaboration and

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,920
i think that there's that's a key

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
area and a healthy way of thinking is

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
like how can we continue to

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
collaborate with more open source

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,079
projects and really think about this

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,920
from the ecosystem point of view

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,360
um and i just want to in case you

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,800
haven't heard about it there's this

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,079
um group called sustain oss i have the

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
link here

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,519
and it's a lot of people from different

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,640
associations from companies that have

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,360
open source

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,800
program offices that all get together to

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
talk about sustainability

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,640
um and the opportunity here for

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,079
kde and other organizations is that we

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,240
think about also

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,320
a broader set of skills and more

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,440
diversity in open source

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,839
and with this i mean going beyond normal

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,079
non-code contributions which are usually

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,079
like documentation or translation

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,079
outreach but really challenging

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,399
ourselves to think even further

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,680
for example someone might be interested

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,839
in building skills

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
for sales or business development or

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,639
they might have that expertise

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,000
they would be great for fundraising or

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,880
partnerships teams

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,200
here at open source you know katie and

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,320
other open source projects

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,839
or people who have hr and people skills

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
or expertise

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,000
they'd be great for engagement teams

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,600
boards of board of directors or

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
newcomers initiatives

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
so again let's think even beyond just

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,160
the normal

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,120
non-code contributions and do outreach

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
into those areas

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,800
the final focus area is connection

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
and this is all about people people

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,800
focus programs

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,079
i think social events are crucial to the

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,160
health of communities and i was so happy

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,200
to see that here at academy we have a

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,440
couple of

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
social events coming up i've included

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
links here just in case you haven't

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
already

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,399
signed up i'm signed up for one of the

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
escape rooms and really excited about it

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,440
and i think it's really important to

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
have these regular

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
social interactions so that you keep

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
building

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,480
um relationships with the people that

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,959
you're working with it really helps

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,720
newcomers feel connected people who are

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,399
already part of the community to feel

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,000
motivated to continue

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,320
to contribute and i think it's it's

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
great to remember that we're a global

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
community

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,680
so time zones and uh like the way that

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,880
you connect

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,720
um is really important um some people

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
may not have great internet connections

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,160
maybe a chat based thing might be more

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,120
useful in certain

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,839
situations versus maybe video would be

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,079
better in

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,440
others so thinking about all those

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
things

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
um onboarding initiatives i think that's

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,399
really important for the connection

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,199
having a

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,760
some sort of a personal touch might be

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,160
great to incorporate into such a thing

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
um

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,760
and i love that katie's thinking about

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,000
this um

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,680
i know that the the move to get lab was

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,920
actually part of this where

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
you're thinking about the newcomers

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,199
experience

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,519
and the types of tools that'll help make

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,480
it easier for people to contribute

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,680
so i want to encourage that continuation

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,720
to think about

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,480
the people first and again

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
um i think that it's really important

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
not just to focus on the technical

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
skills

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,880
that our community has but also um the

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,399
the people skills and so having

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,480
people-oriented training

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,560
on things like implicit bias which i

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,839
know happened earlier at academy and i'm

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,680
bummed that i missed out um we at gnome

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
had this code of conduct training for

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
events teams so that they know how to

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
handle complaints

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,079
and to actually implement a code of

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,600
conduct

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,600
uh and things like collaborative

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,399
communication which is what the rest of

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,040
this presentation will be about i think

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,399
it's really important to build in these

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,320
people skills

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
into a community in order to make them

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,839
resilient and

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,160
in order to enable just collaboration in

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
general

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,880
okay so as i mentioned the rest of this

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,519
is going to be

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,440
around collaborative communication and

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,279
if you've seen some of my other talks

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,480
this year this will be

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,079
a pretty condensed version and it won't

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
have all of the topics but

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,279
i hope you'll still learn something

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,639
today for

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,000
people new to this topic i'm going to

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,320
start off with some of my

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,040
favorite hacks and these are ones that i

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,959
really

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,839
would love everybody in the world to

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,839
know

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,279
the first is that it is the writer's job

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:52,399
to be understood and for this

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,079
formatting really helps so i know that

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,440
sometimes when we're writing

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,079
um issue descriptions or anything else

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,600
we sometimes we have bullet points and

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,360
sometimes bullet points even like we

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,279
think that that's good formatting

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,160
but it can end up looking like a wall of

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,519
text so here you'll notice that i have

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,560
bullets but i've actually

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,480
bolded the first item to kind of

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,920
give you a sense of what the rest of the

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,680
bullet will be

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
and that really helps somebody be able

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
to skim through it

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,600
and understand like what they're most

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,279
interested in or be able to refer back

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,120
to it later

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,959
so that's a really handy thing doing a

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,959
skim test

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,040
also making sure that you understand

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,160
what if you have a call to action

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,160
and what that is make it really clear

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,160
make sure to state who needs to do it

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,320
and by when

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
try to avoid long sentences break them

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,440
up if at all possible

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
and then do not assume previous

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,079
knowledge

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,680
make sure that it's easy for anybody to

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
just jump right in

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,680
and this might even be thinking about

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,759
like the acronyms that you're using

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,720
or just the terminology that you're

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
using

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,560
um it might end up excluding others so

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,400
make sure that you think through it

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,679
through that lens of making sure that

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
anybody can jump right in

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,000
um as i mentioned a lot of us are

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,039
you know spending time writing things

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,959
and issues

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,480
and communicating via merge requests or

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,720
other things that are development

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
oriented and

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
i think that formatting is really

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,039
important there

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,000
here's an example of an issue that our

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,440
social team

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,080
actually created at gitlab where

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,919
when you have um this is an issue

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,799
template so whenever you have a request

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,360
for them

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,880
you can easily go through all of the

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,080
steps they need you to fill

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,760
in and be able to submit it

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,600
and here you see that they've made use

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,679
of different titles of

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,080
um of checkboxes of emoticons

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
and all of this really helps you be able

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,200
to perform the tasks that they need you

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
to

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,320
so i i want us all to keep that in mind

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,080
as we're

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,400
writing our own issue descriptions and

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
sometimes when we open feature requests

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
or file bugs

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,880
they can sit around for years and if

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,520
they're really you know

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,200
controversial they might have hundreds

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,919
of comments in them

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
and so it's important for us also to

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,360
treat

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
the description area as a living

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,880
document as a living

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,039
section where you might want to have a

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,440
summary of what the conversation has

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
been so far or what's going on

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,919
that way people don't have to read

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,080
through 752 comments

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,960
and try to understand what's going on

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,280
but they can

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,000
get a quick sense of what's happening

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,559
and then go

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
into the comments to get further detail

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,200
so again this is keeping in mind that

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,039
everybody

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,039
should just be able to jump right in

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,120
this next one is one of my personal

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,400
favorites it's

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,200
yes and and so basically it's instead of

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,559
saying no

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,440
or yes but which is a favorite of many

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,400
people

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,840
just try switching it to yes and so you

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
can say something like

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,799
yes i hear you and i disagree

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
so just by using that and it

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,880
acknowledges

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,919
what the person has just said and it

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,840
lets you still disagree and so

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,200
that makes somebody more willing to

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,720
listen to you because

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,880
they feel heard and understood

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
and then they're willing to try to hear

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
and understand you

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,840
so it's a it's a very powerful

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,840
psychological difference

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
i really encourage you to start using it

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,600
and it's so cool that just one little

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,880
word

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,720
can have such a profound uh it can make

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,360
such a profound difference to

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,080
to how we collaborate you know like that

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,480
and

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,200
can make somebody go from feeling

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,240
attacked

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,960
or like not listened to to feeling

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
heard and wanting to collaborate and so

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,919
collaborative

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,000
communication collaborative phrases are

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
so important here's a list you're

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
welcome to screenshot it

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,360
and so an example i won't go through all

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,360
of these but the very first one

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,080
how might we um another alternative of

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,559
this

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
that isn't as collaborative is we need

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,559
to solve this

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,679
challenge it's a statement it's you know

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,799
saying we so it's inclusive uh

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,919
but if you just change that to

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,960
how might we solve this challenge it

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,799
then goes from

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,000
kind of like a closed off feeling to

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,559
more of like a

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
ah i'm invited to participate i get to

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,120
give my input and my ideas

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,799
and so that one little switch again

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,200
makes a huge difference

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,919
and a lot of these phrases do the same i

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,960
encourage you

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,840
to read up on other ones that

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
might help you too

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,360
all right next section is navigating

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,039
cultural differences

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,280
and this is really important as we

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,080
continue to expand our communities

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,080
and diversify our contributor base

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,559
this section is really based off of

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,919
the culture map which is written by erin

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,039
meyer

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,080
she does research into this topic

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,799
and she's plotted out um countries along

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,600
these seven

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,039
indicators which are communicating

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,559
evaluating

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,360
leading trusting disagreeing scheduling

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,640
and persuading and while i don't have

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,799
time to go through all of these i'll

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,360
cover a few

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:46,159
the first one is communication

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,760
here we go communicating we have low

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,600
context cultures and

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,520
high context cultures low context value

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,720
communication that is precise

00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,080
simple and clear oftentimes repetition

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,480
is used to avoid misunderstandings

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,039
versus high context cultures care about

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,600
sophisticated language and nuanced

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:12,000
layered often times you have to read

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,039
between the lines

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,320
the next indicator is evaluating and

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,080
this has to do with how

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,559
people deliver negative feedback

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,280
direct negative feedback cultures

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,640
deliver

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,840
feedback frankly bluntly honestly

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,880
they don't soften them with positive uh

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,000
feedback or positive messages and they

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
oftentimes use

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,520
absolutes so things like you always do

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,280
this or

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,760
you completely failed things like that

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,320
and it's okay to be to give negative

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,280
feedback

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,360
in front of groups on the other hand

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,840
indirect negative feedback cultures

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,159
deliver the feedback softly subtly and

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,400
diplomatically

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,600
they often use positive messages to wrap

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
negative ones so

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,640
you've heard of the you might have heard

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,799
of the sandwich effect which is

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
positive thing you give your negative

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,799
feedback and then you end with a

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
positive

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,520
sandwich effect and oftentimes

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,720
qualifying descriptors are used like you

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,880
sort of do this a little bit sometimes

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,600
uh oftentimes feedback this this

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,480
negative feedback is given in private

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
and so you can see how if cultures value

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,000
giving negative feedback

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,559
in different ways this could be really

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,480
problematic in any situation

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,320
and especially online where sometimes

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,559
like other context is mixed

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,400
missed with like facial expression or

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,279
just in general like

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,360
the physical cues that you get so it's

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,080
really important to understand that this

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,279
difference

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,080
exists and as we navigate these

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,880
uh different relationships and different

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,159
scenarios

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,159
when we're working in open source

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
this last indicator is persuading and

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,159
this is

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,240
principles first cultures value the why

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,919
before anything else they've been

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,799
trained to develop the theory

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,520
or the concept first before presenting

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,720
facts

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,480
statements or opinions and applications

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,480
first cultures value the how

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,799
or the what first they're trained to

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,159
begin with the facts and the statements

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:25,120
and then back it up as necessary

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,400
um and what aaron meyers mentioned is

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,240
that

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
somebody from france might get really

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,400
frustrated if they're working with

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,400
a manager from the united states for

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,279
example that is constantly asking them

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,200
to do

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,600
something and mentioning the how and the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
what but not really the why

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,120
and so again i just think that this is a

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,000
really interesting indicator

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,400
to know about as we consider how we work

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,919
with

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,039
with others and uh lastly i kind of

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,679
wanted to show

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,279
how this actually works by choosing an

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,240
example of um

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,799
seeing where the kdev board of directors

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
is from

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,720
or what cultures they might be identify

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
with

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,919
and i didn't consult all of the board

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,640
members i'm sorry so this is just my

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,880
best guess

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
based on some information that i've been

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,919
able to gather

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,720
so this is um we have directors with

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,440
backgrounds

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
from canada germany greece netherlands

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,520
spain

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
and um as you can see there's a map of

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,200
that

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,159
visually on the right we'll just choose

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,400
the trusting

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,919
indicator which is kind of in the middle

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
of that all

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
and you can see that some of the board

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,640
members are

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,279
from cultures that are task-based um

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,360
trust building which means that the way

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,279
that they build trust is by

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,960
doing tasks with others like how well do

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,120
you perform how

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
like can i depend on you from a work

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,559
perspective

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
and versus there are some board members

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
that are more from the relationship

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,799
based

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,559
trust building which they really need

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,480
more of that personal connection and

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,159
understanding do others trust you

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
what else do you do in your life like

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,880
what's the full

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,679
person here that i'm interacting with

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,279
and so with this it would be really

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,679
great for the board to have

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,880
both to really work on building both

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,159
types of trust

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
and making sure that there are some

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,200
social events where they can get to know

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,320
each other over lunch

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,760
or you know drinks or whatever it is

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,440
and keeping in mind that others might

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
build trust more through just working

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,159
together and really like carrying out

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,640
the tasks

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,400
so um by looking at maps like this you

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,279
can start to understand the working

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
groups or the

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,440
the people that you normally interact

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,960
with and develop more empathy for

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,320
the approach of everybody

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,080
all right final tips i'm almost at time

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,600
the first is really to invest time in

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
understanding the people that you work

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,480
with

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,679
don't make assumptions i just kind of

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,120
did in the last slide

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,440
but somebody may not identify it

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,480
as the culture of the country where they

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
were born or

00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,760
someone might look like they're from a

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,840
certain culture but they may

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,679
totally identify with a different one so

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,520
don't make assumptions

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
and then i think that it's okay to set

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,919
expectations

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
um i've included a link below to check

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,799
out

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,679
gitlab's cross culture collaboration

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,919
guide which is

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
what inspired this section of my of my

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
talk

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,279
um but you know in in the cross culture

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
collaboration guide they really

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,399
mentioned you know

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,159
gitlab values this type of communication

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,279
or like this is the leadership style

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,600
that we have

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,520
um and and i think that's okay but we

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
need to also understand that as we're

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,279
building

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,520
diverse teams um and having for example

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
an

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,279
interview process that really values low

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,760
context communication

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,320
that means that you might be you know

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
not

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,159
allowing people from high context

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,799
communication cultures

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,080
to be part of your company so you really

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,080
have to understand

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
these differences and see how they're

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,640
affecting

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,360
our interviews uh our interviews and

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,360
everything else

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,880
all right and i'm going to end with this

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,679
quote which is

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
communication works for those who work

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,120
at

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,799
it uh quote by john powell and

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,720
this really is meant to just encourage

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,240
you to continue to develop your

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,399
communication skills

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,279
it's something that is quite technical

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,200
in nature in

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,960
in many ways like there's psychology

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,720
behind it and that you know it takes

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,480
research to really understand

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,760
how best to communicate um and so

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,240
i think that by having communities where

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,679
you're

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,320
able to communicate well and you build

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,880
resiliency into your program into your

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
into your

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,440
open source project because people are

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,399
able to bounce back more easily by

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,760
having that human connection

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,919
so that's it um i'm at time

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
so if you have any questions feel free

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,679
to send me a message on linkedin

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,760
twitter at me on uh gitlab

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,399
and i'll be reading the shared note

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,679
stock later and responding there

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,679
thank you very much

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,720
thank you so much naruto that was super

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,200
interesting and i hope

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
many of us will take some interesting

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,720
learnings from it

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,159
and yeah there are a bunch of questions

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,440
in the shared notes um

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,799
maybe you can answer them in the chat

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,799
later also

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,799
and that concludes our second day of
