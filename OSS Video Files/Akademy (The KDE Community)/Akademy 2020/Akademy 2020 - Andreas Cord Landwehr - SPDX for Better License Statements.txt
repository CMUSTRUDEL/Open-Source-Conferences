Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	SPDX identifiers are an important step in enable automatic tooling for checking license statements. In this talk, I want to motivate why to use them and show how simple it is to apply them. Specifically, I will give a short overview what already happened inside the KDE Frameworks and where you can help to support the conversion to SPDX.
