Title: Akademy 2020 - Bhushan Shah - Virtual Sprints
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	After COVID-19, it is becoming increasingly hard to do a in-person sprint. But is that a bad thing? What are alternatives? Let's find out.

Bhushan has organized two virtual sprints so far,

- Plasma Mobile mini sprint
- Plasma Virtual sprint

Both sprints were using the BigBlueButton instance. This talk gives insights on how to successfully organize virtual sprint, how to deal with the time-zones, and overall organization of Virtual Sprint.

Bhushan will also share the benefits of the Virtual Sprint for attendees.

[Music]

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,800
thank you

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,199
so my presentation is about

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,359
virtuous friends um

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,359
so

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,880
uh first of all uh

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,239
what are the sprints uh

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,200
so the springs are something we have

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
named our in-person events and they are

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,399
mostly

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,160
in the euro and

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,399
mostly in the europe because uh i'd say

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
most of the sprint attendees come from

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,559
europe and it

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,480
let's say it's not physical for them to

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,879
like it's not feasible for

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,559
let's say 10 people to travel to india

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,000
and

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,280
it is much cheaper and economical

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,560
uh to for traveling one person from

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
india to europe so i'd say like most of

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,720
the sprints

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,400
are happening in the euro they are

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,880
important for community building and

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,479
in specific soft general

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,400
development and advancement and also

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:34,240
they are quite fun because like

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,520
when like 12 10 to 12 or more developers

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,840
meet together

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,840
the phone is connected uh

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,960
okay this slide is not loading

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,000
okay so um this was

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,280
various virtual sprints i found

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
some really old photos uh

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479
so there is bean spring there is ronda's

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,759
brain

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
there is super cd frameworks plasma and

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
usability screen

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,879
and one of the close friends

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,520
so we have just friends where

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,560
people ranging from four to five to

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,200
let's say

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
40 people met together at one place

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,239
stayed

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
together for one weeks and uh

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,080
and worked on improving various things

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,480
specific to one

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,720
project or even just general in teddy

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,480
so uh

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,959
this spring served us much better for

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,959
um this many years but

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,800
uh but this year the main

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,200
problem which affected the whole

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,239
sprints and in-person events is kobe 13

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,080
and due to that uh in-person meetings

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,519
were no longer visible

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,159
and it was no longer possible to have

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
let's say five to ten people get

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,000
together

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,840
or like for people living outside of

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
europe it was not even possible to

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
travel to europe so

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,159
the question which comes is

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,280
we needed to adapt to the situation we

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
needed to

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
follow the social distancing rules we

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
needed to follow

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,560
the travel restrictions and in general

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
the whole

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,159
in-person sprints were impossible like

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
lots of companies also had to switch to

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,640
remote force

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,720
for during the past six to seven months

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,360
so we also had to add up to this

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
situation

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,080
so the question is is it a bad thing

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,360
that this happened in terms of for our

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,120
springs

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,920
uh in my opinion the

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
we also learned a totally new way of

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,120
getting together

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,560
and it's a virtuous brains uh instead of

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,919
being in-person events we this

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,560
this would be fully online event

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,360
and since it's fully online we don't

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
need to

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,880
travel so it's a pretty much global

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
like i don't really need visa to attend

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,240
the online conference or

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,759
online meeting uh and we also have

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,919
it is travel first and by extension also

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:47,919
reduced carbon footprint on maple

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,919
by traveling to the english springs

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,240
uh so uh that were uh

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,600
so far like three different sprints

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,479
happened which

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
fully virtual uh one of them is getting

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,479
beam sprint

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,199
another is plasma mobile ministry

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,080
and another and then there is plasma

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,560
spring

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,600
as well so get it beam spring

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,880
was for one weekend

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,440
it was fully irc meetings and

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,919
uh they had very specific topics decided

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,960
before

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,600
uh beforehand and it was a replacement

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
for

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,919
in-person and annual sprints they have

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,639
like every year uh

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
another sprint which we decided out of

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
the blue was

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
up uh was plasma while virtual sprint so

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,120
since

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
like fully fully locked down was in

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
place

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
he decided that we should host this

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,000
virtual spring

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,400
uh we had to spend on one of the first

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,759
staged instruments for academy

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,000
uh thanks to kenny for that um

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
it was uh it had single track of

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
discussion uh we decided

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
topics on first day and we also first

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,160
did

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,160
online workshops during that sprint

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
another sprint was plasma virtual sprint

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
uh

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,360
it also happened on big blue button room

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
um

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,759
also had a single track but it was

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
slightly more structured than the plasma

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
while spraying plasma waste print was

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,800
more like

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,199
the side topic as you go and uh work on

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
those topics but the plasma spring was

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,319
much more structured we had

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,840
like a schedule for the whole spring

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,840
and it was much more structured

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,759
compared to the mobile sprint because we

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,759
learned how to do this better

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
and so the question is like how to

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,120
organize this virtual

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,440
spring so from

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,319
my experience i'd say you need to decide

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
on schedule

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,120
and schedule and time slots which work

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,160
for most of the team members

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,680
like depending on where they need uh you

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,800
need to decide on clear

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,520
agenda for the discussion uh

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,319
the on spot discussions does not really

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,479
help

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,360
with the in the virtual sprints

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,560
and also we need to allocate probably

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
half an hour or

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
however for social or off-topic chat

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,199
because

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
those areas were also part of in-person

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,759
check

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,039
in-person events so it's good to have

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,160
that

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,919
uh as part of your event and also you

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,800
need to announce event in advance like

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,880
we announced plus

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
always spend like two days in advance

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,599
and that did not really

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
actually work that well but

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,680
yeah you also need to announce event in

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,960
advance

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,520
uh for technical side of the uh

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,039
for this uh we have infrastructure in

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,360
place for organizing

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:02,800
large virtual events which is meet.

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,879
we have good also to attend this you

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,360
need good audio video equipment

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
because that makes experience much

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,840
smoother

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400
and also you need reasonable internet

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,440
connections and

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,599
if you are interested in organizing some

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,759
kind of such virtual sprints or event

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,960
you need feel free to contact

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,520
me or academic team

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,120
about that and we will be happy to help

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,840
help for that

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
and that's it uh i thought i guess we

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,399
don't have

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,680
time for questions but if you have any

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,399
questions feel free to

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,399
send it to me and i will be happy to

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
answer

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
