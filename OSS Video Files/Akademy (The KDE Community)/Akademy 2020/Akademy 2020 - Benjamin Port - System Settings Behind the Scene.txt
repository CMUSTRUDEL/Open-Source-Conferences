Title: Akademy 2020 - Benjamin Port - System Settings Behind the Scene
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	System settings are a core part of Plasma highly customizable eco system. During last year almost all module were ported to KConfigXT.
We will see which benefits all modules (based on QWidget or QtQuick) got for existing feature like fixing reset/apply/default button state.
But also new features allowed by this standardization from already landed feature to ideas for the future.
Finally this talk will end with a discussion about which limitation we can encounter with KConfigXt current implementation and what to take in consideration when writing new module, porting existing one.
