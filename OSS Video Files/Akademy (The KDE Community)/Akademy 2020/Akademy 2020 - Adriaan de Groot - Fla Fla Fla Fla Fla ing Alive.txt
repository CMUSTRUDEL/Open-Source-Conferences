Title: Akademy 2020 - Adriaan de Groot - Fla Fla Fla Fla Fla ing Alive
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The FLA -- Fiduciary License Agreement -- is a tool that the KDE community has to manage licensing in the long-term. The "long-term" here means "beyond the participation of a particular person in the KDE community" and it's a useful tool in protecting KDE as a whole with Free Software principles.

Copyright lasts a long time. Rules changes. Legal frameworks change. So copyright -- and by extension, the Free Software licenses that work with copyright to ensure the four Freedomes -- can last too long: so long that circumstances change out from under it. This talk will examine the FLA used by the KDE community and describe how it is used to mitigate change in licenses and copyright, and why you should probably sign one.
