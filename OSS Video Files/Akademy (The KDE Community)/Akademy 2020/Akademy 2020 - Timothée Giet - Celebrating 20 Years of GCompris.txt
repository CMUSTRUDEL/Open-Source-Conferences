00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,639
hi everyone

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,040
thank you for joining the talk so this

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,359
year

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,119
still celebrating the 20 years of

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,640
g-compre

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,359
so i will explain you what we've been

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,480
working on

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,480
and what to expect this year what so

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,840
let's start

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,360
and for those who don't know gcm3 is a

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,399
educational suite for

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,680
children from 2 to 10 with it you can

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,559
well children can learn not everything

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
but almost

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,719
like from learning how to use a keyboard

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,559
and mouse

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,920
but also reading writing

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,320
mathematics physics all kinds of science

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
and

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,559
discover a lot of different things

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
and it's used in primary schools all

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,600
over the world

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,520
we've seen it used in schools in france

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,960
in germany spain

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
india brazil and so on

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,400
we also saw it uh deployed by

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,439
associations in

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,840
poor remote villages in africa

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:29,600
in asia and other places

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,759
so it i we don't do anything to track

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,840
the user so i cannot tell exactly the

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
number of users we have but from the few

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
metrics i have i

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,880
can say for sure we can count it as

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,280
million a few million users

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,280
for sure

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,799
this year started the change started in

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,799
february february

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
i decided to make the full version

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,280
binaries of the company completely

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,240
free of cost for all platforms it was a

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,360
change i had in mind for a lot of time i

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,400
wanted to do that change but

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,040
it was a big jump to do

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,640
so in the beginning of the year i

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,599
as i saw the situation starting to get

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,120
bad with the

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,760
coronavirus i so

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
anticipated that it would be very good

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
time to

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,920
give this tool for every child in the

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,200
world who

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,640
can learn at home so

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,080
yeah this was

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,840
one day i wake up and say okay today

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,560
let's do the switch and i discussed with

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,160
johnny the other commentator and

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,160
within one two days it was done

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,280
so but then the question was

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,480
by making it at no cost how could i keep

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,400
working and found my work on it so i

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
decided to go back on patreon

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,080
i already had a patreon page that i

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,080
started when i

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,400
started to work on the graphics project

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,959
country in 2015 but

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,599
because it didn't work good i left it

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
alone and

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,760
abandoned it a bit but it was good time

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,720
to try again

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,440
and hopefully it does work

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,040
good enough for now we don't have i

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,080
don't have yet that many

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,400
patrons but hopefully

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,120
there's a one company who deploys

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,480
decompre

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,519
on pre-installed and hardware and they

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,640
agreed to support me on patreon

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,879
so it helps to

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,959
for now keep the same amount of work

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,599
the same amount of time i can dedicate

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,599
for that work

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,439
and then there was the lockdown effect

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
in march when

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,640
the lockdown was starting to be

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,239
effective everywhere

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,320
almost in the world we could see a

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,960
lot of blog posts from teachers all

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,680
around recommending

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,720
to parents to use decompre at home for

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,560
homeschooling for the kids and we even

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
have some mails from

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,960
teachers who previously bought the full

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
version and they were asking if

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,840
they didn't see the news that we made it

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,120
free and they were asking if we could

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,479
allow somehow the there are

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,160
pupils to use it at home and we say yeah

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,160
that's already done they can download

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,440
the full version now and

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,479
yeah let them enjoy it we also

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,880
saw lots of youtube videos posted

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,600
uh by different random people who

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,960
wanted to show g compre as a good

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,440
alternative for homeschooling

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,000
you can just searching on youtube and

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,720
you will find

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
a lot of funny and interesting results

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:24,080
yeah so what to expect

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,440
very soon next release will finally be

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,199
the 1.0

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,720
release that was weighted by many people

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,080
the 1.0 because we restarted

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
as you know the rewrote the project from

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
scratch

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,320
which started in 2014 and since then it

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,560
took

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,960
some time to board all the activities

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
we don't have yet all the activities

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,280
from the

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
old version but we actually have more

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
activities

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,240
in number and we have the most important

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,120
ones

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
we had we wanted to achieve a few

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,560
milestones before

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
doing that 1.0 release but

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,319
we don't have all of them yet but we

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,440
have enough changes

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,400
uh significant changes to

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
decide to make it this year and well for

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,680
the 20 years it was also

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,319
a good time to celebrate

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,280
so for the improvement that we'll have

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
in the next release

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,919
i will say after but the release

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,400
planning

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,120
we want to do string freeze in

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
about a week so for september 14th we

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
plan to do the string freeze

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
and i will provide better packages for

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
the

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,199
translators to test or to check the

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,400
context

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,280
we will do string freeze for

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
we think two months which is a bit big

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,199
but

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,240
uh we have a lot of new strings

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:04,000
to work on and we also i

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,440
did review all the existing strings

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,120
recently so a lot of

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
translators will find a lot of fuzzy

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,639
strings they will have to adapt or

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
re-translate so it's not a lot of work

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,160
so we will

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,280
give them lot enough time to process

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,440
and during that time we also

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
it would be also a good time for

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,960
everyone who want to provide

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,800
missing voices for the language

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,000
so if you your language is me still

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
missing some voices

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,919
and and you feel like recording your

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,840
voice

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,840
you're welcome to contribute please do

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,879
also just before the string freeze if

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,319
some native english speakers

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,440
want to make a another round of review

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
on the strings

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,759
you're welcome there's still one week

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,759
for that

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,639
so the main big big feature for

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,039
next release will be the multiple data

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,479
set i already talked about it in

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,280
previous talks it's been a long ongoing

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,039
effort we started more than a year ago

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,720
almost two years ago and the future

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,520
is to allow split the content of an

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,120
activity

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,519
into several parts of different

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,039
difficulty levels to make the activities

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,200
more modular

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,320
and more accessible for different ages

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,080
i will explain how it works so here's

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
the main menu of gcom3

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,279
before we had just this tool icon for

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,320
the main configuration

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,279
and we had the same icon in

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
some activities for their activity

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,080
configuration

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
now we have this new icon purple with

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
three lines

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,279
which is for the activity settings it

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,720
contains both

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:23,839
the activity options but also the

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:23,839
multiple dataset options for

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
uh

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,680
is it better now worse is better

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,200
okay good yeah so good i'll

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,320
continue so in the main menu

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,120
what i was saying the we have a

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,560
star icons on each activity to represent

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
its difficulty level

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,160
but now with multiple data sets some

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,680
activities can have

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,399
two icons one the first one showing the

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
minimum

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,040
difficulty of the activated data set

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
and the second one the maximum

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
difficulty so you can have an idea of

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,720
the range

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,920
so when taking on an activity settings

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,360
you will find this menu

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,720
with the dataset panel option

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,480
open by default showing the

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,800
available dataset that you can enable or

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
disable by clicking on the respective

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,839
icon

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,079
and there's a

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,200
second tab with the options if there are

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,480
some options

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,519
and you can click cancel to just

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,279
close without saving your changes save

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,160
to save your changes and go back to the

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,240
menu

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,360
or save and start to save your changes

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
and start the activity

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,600
here you started the activity and you

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,920
find again the same

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
activity settings icon inside the

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
activity

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,839
if you click on it from the activity

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,720
then it will open

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,240
directly on the options tab not the data

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,760
set one because

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,000
usually we expect users to want to

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
set up the data set before starting the

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
activity

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
and changing the options is more

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,399
something they would change

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,399
while using the activity typically

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
so here you can just close without

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,800
saving or save and return to the

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
activity

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,519
another change that was needed to

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,440
implement the multiple data set feature

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,959
in the main configuration of the

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,560
software there's this

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,320
difficulty filter option

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,600
it was used to filter activities

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,480
according to the level of difficulty but

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
now

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
it also filters that asset so if for

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,279
example i select

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,079
one and two start difficulty it will

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,079
filter

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:25,279
activities which has no content for

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,639
this level

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,320
and it will also automatically filter

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,880
the data sets

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,480
and enable the corresponding ones so now

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
you see numbers with dice that's only

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
one and two stars well before it has

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,800
it had one and three and if you go in

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
the menu

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,519
you see all those other datasets are

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,519
hidden

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
we also have new activities for the next

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,160
release the first one is

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
gravity this one i decided to work on

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,839
because

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,720
i wanted to replace an existing activity

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,240
we had called introgravity

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,920
which had several issues which was not

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
really flexible

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,279
the main issue is that the concept of

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
the activity was to

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
change the size of the planet to move a

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,959
spaceship which

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,440
by itself is a bit wide concept and it

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,120
was

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,320
very hard to use and it did not

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,200
scale at all to phone screens

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,279
so i scrapped it and restarted the

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
different one from scratch

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,079
for gravity in this one it's more simple

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,199
and easy to use without just

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,839
random planets in both sides of the

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,120
screen

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,680
going up down and you have to move the

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,000
spaceship and it will be attracted to

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,959
the planet according to gravity force

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,440
and the arrows on the top the lengths

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,560
change

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,079
depending on the gravity so it's

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
more easy and fun to use than the

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,920
previous one and it gives

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,160
good sense of gravity for the kids the

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,199
next new activity is baby keyboard

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,600
this one was request requested by a user

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
who wanted something very simple for his

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,240
baby to

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:18,959
get started using a keyboard

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,519
now it's the simplest activity possible

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,920
just type

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,519
any key on the keyboard and it will type

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
the corresponding character and play the

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,560
voice if there's one

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,040
the next activity is learn digits this

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,680
one was requested by

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,680
emmanuel one of our contributors he

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,560
it's based on an exercise this

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
contributor is a teacher

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,199
for primary school so it's based on an

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,399
exercise he's using

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,040
in his school to teach digits so we

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,399
display

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,440
a number here we play the voice and the

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,880
kid has to

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,040
just click the number of dots and

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,959
press ok to validate the answer and

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
there's also options to instead of

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,560
display digit display some

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,360
dots or display hand to count

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,639
to learn the value of each number and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,639
associate it with the voice

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,120
next new activities are learn addition

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,240
and learn subtraction which are

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,720
derivative of learner digits it's the

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
same

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,759
but just we show a simple additional

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,320
subtraction to

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,399
just to learn the concept of those

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,519
operations

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,000
and i kept the best for the end the new

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
last new activity is analog electricity

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,959
which was the most

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,199
missing one we had from the old

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
version of gcompre that was not pointed

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
yet and

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
now we have it thanks to my wife

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,600
aishwarya who

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,800
decided to work on it this summer since

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,079
she has a

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,040
electronics degree electronics engineer

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,160
degree and she

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,079
wants to work on software development

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
now it was a good exercise to practice

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,000
her skills

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
so we have a future parity

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
exact picture parity with the old

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,240
activity with first level

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,079
with those three components battery

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,880
build and switch

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,199
a second level with a bit more

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,680
components like real start

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,560
another kind of switch three point

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,880
switch

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:32,079
and the connection point and

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,639
third level with again more components

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,320
like

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,320
resistor red lead and

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,320
yeah we have same features but we also

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,959
have a few improvements compared to dual

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,720
version

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,040
like you can see all the wires

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
share the same color if they share the

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,199
same connection point

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,839
which helps to understand the circuit

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
how it works

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,799
now another improvement

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,970
is that we have

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,240
we can rotate components we can

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,079
[Music]

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,520
zoom in them out and turn the canvas

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,559
these features we

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,079
come from the digital electricity

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,280
activity we had which we can we could

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,120
copy some of the code but

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,520
it was not modular enough we can reuse

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,679
it we had to have copy

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,400
another good improvement is we have the

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,400
information

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,799
of each component if you click on the

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,080
component and click on the information

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,919
icon you have a text explaining

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
what this component does and how it's

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,320
used

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,480
and another improvement is if you do a

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,799
very well circuit which should not work

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,400
or

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,480
is called illegal as it's called in the

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
engine we're using well then we will

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,559
display a warning message

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,360
explaining that there's a voltage loop

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,240
or

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,960
source shorted by wire and then that you

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,280
should

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,760
fix your circuit to make the simulation

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,760
work good

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,840
and of course the belt will break if

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,600
there's too much current in it

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,520
and same for the red lead

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,480
if you use it without the resistor you

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,480
have that surprise

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,640
the next improvement is keyboard support

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:31,200
we fixed all the focus issues

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,200
and we added the new keyboard controls

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,280
and i added new images for several

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
activities

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,000
and made layout improvements again for

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,360
several activities

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,559
and made countless bug pieces but

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,559
bug fixes and usability improvements all

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,760
around so

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,559
that's it uh thank you i want to thank

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
everyone

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
all the contributors all my patrons

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,960
supporting my work

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,360
and yeah if you have any questions i'm

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,799
not sure we'll have time but

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,360
let's see yeah i'm so sorry about that

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,200
we are out of time so you're quite

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,840
nervous at the moment if you

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
have any questions please contact miloti

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
directly

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,120
thank you to moti that was a great talk

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
yeah thank you too

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,919
and yeah don't hesitate to give

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,919
