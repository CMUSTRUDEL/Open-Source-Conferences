	00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,240
hello

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,680

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,720
i hope everyone had a great day um

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,439
let's go through uh from

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,880
the first room to the fourth

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,320
um okay yeah so room one

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,680
in session one of the day

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:43,520
started with the 25th anniversary

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,440
um which is useful because i was there

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
if anyone else wants to chime in please

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,640
do

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,600
so we talked about having

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
ideas for how to celebrate kde's 25th

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,199
anniversary that anniversary is coming

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,680
up

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,879
next year on october 14 2021

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,760
we talked about different uh

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
ways to celebrate on social media and in

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
person

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,280
and with hybrid events uh keeping in

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
mind that covet isn't completely over

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,520
yet

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,960
so yes we had some great ideas flowing

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,799
um some of which uh were videos to

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,119
redo something like the welcome video

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,680
from this year's academy

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,520
uh saying happy birthday to kde in

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
different languages

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,119
we had some in-person ideas like 25

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,000
small events in different cities

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,920
around the world we had the idea of

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,920
um let's see

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,840
doing uh different

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,680
group events in 25 different cities and

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,360
being able to live stream them

00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,159
all to big blue buttons so everyone can

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,159
be together

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,920
and there was a bunch more that i cannot

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,360
think of off the top of my head

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,959
so let's move on to the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,840
next which was with albert

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,480
with i18 and albert would you mind

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
giving us

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
a brief overview

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,120
i'm coming slowly coming

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,080
hello so yes we did the translation both

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,280
uh we uh overextended ourselves a bit

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
because we

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
were lucky and was somebody after us so

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,959
we talked about lots of things

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,440
one of the pressing matters we have

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
in the translation world is that there

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,920
is

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
people that would like to be using a web

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,599
translation

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
based system which we don't have we

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,440
discussed a bit

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
how we could move forward with that

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,400
unfortunately

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
none of the people that really want that

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
showed up for the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
both so it was it was okay but we would

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,239
have

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
benefited from more people but i mean we

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,720
can't force people to enjoy meetings all

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,840
the time

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
uh besides that we we spoke about lots

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
of things there's like

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,680
plans to rewrite a part of our uh

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
infrastructure that we use for

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
uh creating the translation so that

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,599
people can start actually translating

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,799
uh the webpage we have right now is very

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,000
old

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,599
we are just plainly hoping to replace it

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
with someone else something else and we

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,560
don't have to care about it because we

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,840
just kill it

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,480
uh there is a need of

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,159
working a bit on the documentation we

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,400
have lots of documentation

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,080
but it's in lots of different places and

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
it's if you try to start

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,440
it's not so easy to figure out

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,840
what to do what to read and where to go

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,159
so there's a plan to move forward with

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,159
that

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,080
yeah we talk about more things but i

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
think those were the basics and i don't

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,040
really want to bore people with

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,480
translation it's a very important thing

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,920
we need to make it better

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
uh that's the plan

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,400
sounds like a good plan thank you

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
well we had a quiet morning besides the

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,919
25th anniversary so let's move

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,199
into room two uh which

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,840
had a buff on k-runner with alexander is

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,840
alexander here to give us a little

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
update

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,720
hey there hello

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,520
we had a meeting about cameron

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,440
and we especially wanted to focus on the

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,040
debuff support

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,400
because this way it is far easier

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,400
for other developers to write plugins

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,479
because they can use their language of

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,000
choice for example python

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,039
or worst or go or whatever

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
and there are currently some features

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,039
missing

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,280
like some life cycle methods of the

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,639
carrana objects and also

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,840
we can't dynamically specify the actions

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,320
for each match and we had discussed

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,000
solutions for that

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,759
and also the usage help for k runner is

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,039
currently in progress

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,680
so we had to make sure that the dbus

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,639
runners will work for that too

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
and we also settled for making another

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,919
library

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,759
which will make it easier to write

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,479
k-runner plugins in c

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
plus so that you don't actually need a

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,720
lot of boilerplate

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,680
and you have a lot of good documentation

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,240
where you can

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
just start writing your application and

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
don't have to worry about all that

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
awesome thank you

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
okay well that was all for room two

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
today

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,800
let's see what room three brought us

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,360
with next generation

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,360
styling is anyone there from that buff

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,160
uh yes except that my camera doesn't

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,520
seem to work unfortunately

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,919
um so

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,319
we have a long-term issue

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,720
where in that we have three different

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,280
styling systems currently within kde

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
that we would really like to unify in

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,759
the long term

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,479
and i've been working on a prototype

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,440
for a unifi or at least a style that

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,880
unifies cute widgets and kid quick

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,120
uh during academy and

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
so the boss started with me presenting

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,240
that

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,039
and then we discussed what

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,520
whether this would be a good approach to

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,199
take

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,639
you know going forward uh there were

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,919
several suggestions

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,919
uh about what we could do with it uh but

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,560
generally the

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,840
uh the style seems to be we have have

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,199
been received quite

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,319
well um and

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,840
yeah we had a bit of discussion about

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,960
q palette changes in uh

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,960
q6 unfortunately we ran out of time

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,919
before we could

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,319
really get into the depths of that so

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,440
yeah

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,280
that was it awesome do you think you'll

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,319
have any follow-up off tomorrow to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,360
finish up what you missed today

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
uh i think we managed to

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
conclude that we didn't really need much

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,520
more talking for now

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
uh since apparently the palette changes

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,039
in q6 are

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,240
postponed anyway so

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,000
all right okay

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,280
let's go on to the next uh room three

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,639
buff which was the eevee office hour

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:18,240
uh do we have alice or lydia or ika

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,240
nufitos anyone want to jump in here

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,960
i can explain a bit for a second what we

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,960
said

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,479
so basically the idea was to have a

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,240
space where we could discuss uh some of

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,800
the topics that people who attended

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
were interested in which is what we did

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,000
uh

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,560
we went through uh some questions that

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
uh

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,719
came from other bulbs that wanted some

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,279
input from

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,080
from the board and basically that needed

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,200
money

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,000
uh also we discussed the different uh

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,000
strategies that we could do to engage

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
with other organizations for

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,760
largely funding and development we went

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,920
over the

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,040
goals that we set for the av

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,839
on the last atm and on the talk on

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,360
saturday

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,600
and it was all fun we also cleared up

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
all the doubts everybody had about the

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,839
favorite ice cream of

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,720
every member of the board with uh very

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:23,680
clear conclusions in my opinion but

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:27,200
i will leave you all to draw your own

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,880
okay thank you um all right

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,440
well that sums it up for room three

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,880
let's go to room four which is probably

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,040
a very interesting

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:42,399
uh buff contributors of the future

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,399
let's see the littles

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
maybe

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
this is august and august was one of our
