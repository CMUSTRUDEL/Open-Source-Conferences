	00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,880
more of our computing world

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
moved to phones and other handheld

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,320
devices

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,799
and the classical pc

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,640
form factor gets less and less important

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
and that trend is only expected to

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,799
continue

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,200
and to see why this is important for kde

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,400
we actually need to take a look at kde's

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,919
mission

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,120
katie's mission is stated as we envision

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,559
a world in which everyone has control

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,240
over their digital life

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,440
and enjoys freedom and privacy and

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,320
in a world where our digital life

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,919
to an increasing degree takes place on

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,120
mobile devices

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,400
if we as a community don't provide

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,279
solutions for the people to gain control

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
over their

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,120
life and enjoy this freedom and this

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
privacy

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,600
then we as a community are failing our

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,200
very mission

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,000
and i hope most of you know about plasma

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,360
mobile

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,720
that it is the the overarching goal of

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,320
bringing kde software onto a completely

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,400
free phone operating system stack

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,840
but bringing our software to existing

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,080
android devices

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,520
is an important stepping stone in that

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,159
mission

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,480
so today i want to talk about first why

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,320
do we actually care about android

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,799
because after all it's a competing

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,039
product to plasma mobile

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,400
where are we now on the road to

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,600
supporting it

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
how hard is it to do how is it done at

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
all

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,200
and can we improve the process of doing

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,200
it

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,039
so first of all why do we care about

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,559
android

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,279
android right now has over 1 billion

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,760
users

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,480
i do not need to tell you how much more

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,720
this is than we have at this point

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,200
anything also includes a very lot of us

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,200
and by bringing our own software that we

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,520
like and we want to use

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
to the devices we actually use in our

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,240
daily lives

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,480
we enable the eager on dog food testing

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
that is so important for our way of

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,039
development

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
and by bringing our software to this

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,000
very

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,480
very very large user base we actually

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,840
automatically increase our number of

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
potential contributors

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,960
so first of all where are we now in

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
supporting android

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,320
if you look at binaryfactory.kd.org

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,120
you will see that we have nightly bills

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,720
for 30 different kde applications

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,600
on android and those

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,120
nightly builds are uploaded to a kde

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,919
owned

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,600
afterwards repository which you can add

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,720
on your phone and then you can

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,000
install all of them but it's mostly for

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
testing purposes

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
so those things are not meant to be

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
production ready

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,520
seven of our apps are actually featured

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,960
on google play which is

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,440
the main way of getting apps on android

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,039
the most prominent one being kd connect

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
with

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,559
users in the realms of hundreds of

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,799
thousands

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,919
the other apps sadly don't really come

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,640
to that

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,320
and three of our apps are on afro which

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,200
is the go to

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
store for free and open source software

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,960
on android

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,240
which includes kd connect shaken pre and

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,279
ktrip

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,159
and as you see we have way fewer apps in

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,440
the stores than we actually could have

00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,640
and bridging that gap is

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,159
an important thing in light of

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,880
are all about the app's goals

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,159
so the next question is how hard is it

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,279
to do

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,480
the answer is of course it depends but

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,720
let's talk about on what it depends on

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,080
so thanks to the cross platform nature

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,679
of cute

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,240
it can be very easy to get an uh

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,080
get get a cute app working on android

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,159
but there are some things that make it

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,880
hard to do

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,279
the major thing that makes it hard is of

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
course

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,360
mobile unfriendly design if your

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,640
application relies on

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,039
a large screen and keyboard and mouse

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,760
input and isn't responsive or touch

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,000
friendly

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
then you won't have fun using it on

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,080
android

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,279
even though you can compile it and

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,480
cute widgets perform particularly bad in

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,559
this regard

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,120
unless you really take care of it

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,000
quick tends to perform a lot better with

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,120
regards to

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,679
touch input and these kind of stuff

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,240
but of course you still need to think

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,039
about the layout of your application

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,559
to make it properly work on a mobile

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,799
screen

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,640
another thing that makes it hard is

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,799
using deepers because

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,559
keyboards as a concept does not really

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,240
exist on android

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,760
the ipc's mechanism that android has are

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,159
quite different

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,440
so using divas and android just doesn't

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,440
make sense the binary factory builds

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,039
have a hack to get

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,240
qdbas working on and or building on

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,399
android but

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,760
just forget it exists it's not useful

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:49,279
another plot problem can be applications

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,799
assuming behaviors of glypsy

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:55,120
because android uses bionic which is a

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,159
different lipsy implementation

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,080
and if your app tries to use features

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,120
that are specific to glib c

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,919
that's not going to work fortunately

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,919
at least in our software that's not

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,159
really of an issue

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,600
but it can be in lower level components

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,480
also tricky is exotic build systems

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,760
like hand rolled bash scripts or make

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,240
files

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,360
that have no proper support for tool

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,640
chains or cross compiling

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,919
in general things that you see make

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,440
tend to work quite well so again

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,000
our stuff is usually quite fine

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,960
and something else that can make it hard

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,679
is

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,440
apps that use complex multi-process

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,720
architectures like we see

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,840
for example in kio or in akanadi

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,679
and the way multi-processing works for

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,640
android applications is again very

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,640
different

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,080
so the concepts we see on the linux

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,279
desktop do not match

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,679
there so

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,880
how is it actually done it's actually

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,880
quite easy

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,080
you just take cmake and call it with the

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,520
right arguments

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,880
done thanks for coming to my talk

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,440
well okay in if you get into the details

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
it

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,840
is not that simple so the rough overall

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,440
steps

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,679
are first of all you need an android sdk

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,679
and

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,240
mdk the sdk contains stuff like the

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,200
basic

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,000
android system libraries and the tools

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,440
you need to create applications

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,840
the ndk the native development kit

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,640
contains stuff like dc plus plus

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,600
compiler and tool chains and all of that

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,399
so you need that when using c plus plus

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,480
code for android

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,399
then what you also need is a build of qt

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,559
for android you can even build that

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,960
yourself if you have a lot of time

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,000
if you don't then you can just use the

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,039
officially provided binaries

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,039
then what you need to do is build all of

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,440
your apps dependencies

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,320
for android using the tool chain

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,720
provided by the android ndk

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,840
unfortunately there's not really a

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,799
concept of

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,320
package management here so you actually

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,640
need to do this

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,720
sometimes tedious work of building all

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
of your dependencies

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,760
then of course you need to actually

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,600
build your application

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,840
using the android 2 chain and finally

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
there's a tool called android deploy

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
cued

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,760
which you use to take your application

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,799
your dependencies your assets and

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,039
everything and create a final apk out of

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,039
that

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,039
kde does provide some tools to help here

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,760
for example

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,200
extra cmake modules contains a cmak

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,279
toolchain file

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,840
that you can use to build things for

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,919
android which takes care of all the

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,840
compilers set up so you don't need to

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,720
worry about that

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,480
and it also provides some wrapper around

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,000
android deploy cute

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,960
so in the end all you need to do is call

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,159
make create dash apk and if everything

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,640
goes fine

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,200
you have an apk in the end that you can

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,600
install on your phone

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,640
setting the whole thing up to work

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
properly

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,640
can be quite tedious an error prone so

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,200
kde provides a ready-made environment to

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
do that in the form of a docker

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,399
container

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,279
it's what powers the binary factory

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,039
builds

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,039
and you can also use it for local

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,760
development which is nice

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,279
because you can one to one replicate the

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,360
environment you see on the binary

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,480
factory

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,279
then code wise cute and the kde

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,360
frameworks abstract a lot of things so

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,399
you don't need to worry about them

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,440
for example k notifications provides

00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:00,000
a backend for android so you can have

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,279
notifications on linux and on android

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,240
without writing

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,640
any platform-specific code and if you

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,519
want to learn more about kde frameworks

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,600
on android

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,799
i can only recommend forecast talk from

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,799
last year's academy

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,880
so let's say we have an application

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,480
that already works on linux and we want

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,720
to bring it to android

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,840
the first step is we need an

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,399
androidmanifest.xml file

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,679
you can kind of think of it like a

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,279
desktop file

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,440
in the sense that it contains

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,440
application metadata like

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,919
the name a description an icon

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,640
and these kind of things so what i

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,039
usually do

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,080
is i go to some other kde android

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,440
project

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,519
copy the file replace the names and put

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,399
it in my project

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,080
i usually put it into an android

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,720
subfolder

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,559
because quite often you will need extra

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,320
files that are specific for android and

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,320
it's nice to have them all in one place

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,879
next in order for the system to be

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,159
able to find the entry point to your

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,040
application

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,000
you need to declare your main method as

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,560
exported

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,280
which you can do by putting qrdeckle

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,679
export in front of it

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:26,720
and as a final first step

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,800
if you want your app to have a nice icon

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,040
in the launcher you need to put one

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,839
in your android subfolder slash

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,599
resources

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:39,520
drawable

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,320
so now your your simple app hopefully

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,119
will start up on android but you will

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,359
see

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,879
there are no icons anywhere where did

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,520
they go

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,560
so the way we usually load icons on

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,480
linux is

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,760
we load them from the icon theme with

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,040
like q

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,800
i can colon colon from theme but on

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,839
android that doesn't work because press

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,000
icons isn't installed on your android

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,480
system

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,119
the solution here is we need to bundle

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,480
all of the icons that we want to use

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,520
in our apk which we can do with the

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,640
kirigami package breeze icons macro

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,400
where you pass all the names of the

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,440
icons you want to use in your

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,720
application

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,680
and it takes care of including them

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,480
in order to be able to render them you

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,599
will need to

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,640
include qt svg which

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:37,440
you can do by linking your application

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,440
against the qt5 colon colon svg target

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,880
so what else might need to be done

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,079
in kde we really love to use plugin

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,800
systems for

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,520
everything and they need some special

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,160
care

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,400
because android deployed queued needs to

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,800
know which plugins should be included

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,920
inside the apk

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,480
and there is a solution for this

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,000
which you can see in the two code

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,200
examples i have

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,400
linked you here another thing that can

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,680
go wrong is

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,359
on the desktop we sometimes rely on

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,560
finding assets at run

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,760
time somewhere on our disk which

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,680
usually won't work on android because

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,160
they don't get installed or we don't

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,200
have access to the file system

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,359
and to work around this

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,320
you should consider shipping all your

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,040
assets in your resources and access them

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,560
from there

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,440
then it will work another tiny gotcha

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,800
is that q standard cost generic data

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,839
location

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,119
is usually not writable for your

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,599
application

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,560
unless you request the user for

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,800
permission to access the file system

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,160
so in that case consider using hue

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,920
standard paths

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
app data location instead

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,440
so cute and kde frameworks provide a lot

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,240
of abstraction for common cases

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,960
but sometimes you don't get around to

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,160
writing android specific code

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,520
in cmake you can do checks for this

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,320
with if android or if not android and

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,440
then

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,079
add your android specific or android

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,839
exclusive

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,760
code in there in c plus plus you can

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,119
achieve this by using

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:35,280
preprocessor directives with if qos

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,280
android or the equivalents

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,560
and cute android extras

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,640
provide some nice classes for

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,920
some common things that you will

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,839
encounter in

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,160
when dealing with android for example

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,640
permission management

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,640
or things like launching new activities

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,400
but sometimes you don't get around

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,040
to actually call into the android system

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,079
api

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,040
to do some things where no

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,760
wrapper for qt exists you can do this

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,720
using the

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,160
java native interface because the energy

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,000
system apis

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,040
are all meant to be used from java

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,599
and this can be quite painful

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,280
fortunately cute android extras provide

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,320
some wrapper classes

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,000
that make the overall process slightly

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,200
less painful

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,400
but it's still quite ugly

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,960
so if you find yourself

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
in the position of having a nice

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,040
solution for

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
a potentially recurring problem

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,400
in calling into the android system api

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,720
then

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,800
please consider upstreaming your

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,720
solutions to kf5

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,720
many people will thank you for that

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,599
unfortunately my talk is about to end

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,000
and there's a lot of topics that i don't

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,640
have covered yet

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,200
so where can you learn more about this

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,400
of course

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,200
the code is documentation enough

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,960
well i am obviously joking but there's

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,440
some proof to it

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,880
i learned a lot of this by simply

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,920
studying

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,920
how our binary factory image works and

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,839
how everything is set up and

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,079
i recommend you to do the same

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,160
itself obviously provides some

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,040
documentation on writing cued

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,040
applications for android we also have a

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,320
page on the community wiki that has some

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,200
information

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
but it it really needs some love and

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,720
attention to

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,400
be really good and if you want to

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,720
contact me or anyone

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,520
working on bringing kde software to

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,320
android

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,359
you can join us in the kde-android

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,359
channel on matrix

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,960
the last question i want to raise for

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,079
today is can we improve this process

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,359
because it's it's simple in theory

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,920
but it can be tricky in the details so

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,880
what we need is better documentation for

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,400
it and the better tooling for it

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,119
also the the aspect of distributing the

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,119
apps

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,160
getting them into google play and into

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,240
asteroid

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,680
at scale is still a thing that needs to

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,800
be discussed

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,400
so i invite everything who is interested

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,640
in that to have above sometime this week

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,040
i don't have a date or time yet

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,760
so if you're interested in this hit me

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,040
up and

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,520
we will find a slot thank you for your

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
attention

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,200
thanks nicolas yeah uploads in the chat

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,200
and i think we have some questions

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,480
so i'll start going for them

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,359
okay are all of the apps on the binary

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,319
factory

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,319
in a releasable state or have releases

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,720
unfortunately not some of them

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,079
don't even build at this point on the

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,480
binary factory

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,160
they just need someone to to give them

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,240
some care

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,280
some are very proof of concept so

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,000
there's

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,200
some obvious things missing like missing

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,599
icons that are really easy to fix

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,640
some of them are quite okay

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,079
and there are some candidates that

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,760
definitely are

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,440
a potential candidates for bringing them

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,079
into these stores now

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,119
for example kde itinerary is one of the

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,319
candidates

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,960
where i think a proper store release

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,079
should happen soon i'm actually in the

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,280
process of bringing

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,680
it to afroit right now but unfortunately

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,680
not all of them are in this good state

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,640
okay the next person is

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,079
thinking that maybe the solution is to

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,200
have another app like a

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,760
kde app store so you need only to get

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,560
to people you get two people installed

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,079
one app

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,880
right um i

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,599
don't think this is a solution because

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,200
in like

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,520
our circle afterward is the go-to place

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,280
for this kind of software and

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,640
we should stick to that and i don't

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,720
think having our own app store would

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,200
improve the user experience in this

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
regard

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,200
okay next question how would you

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,599
recommend

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,350
handling background tasks like what a

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,560
music player needs

00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,040
[Music]

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,000
i don't think there's a way around

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,880
dealing with

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,200
the proper android api for that which is

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,720
like

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,480
background task things

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,680
uh this might be a thing where we could

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,680
have something in frameworks now

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,640
there is not yet but i would be

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,560
interested in exploring that because we

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,359
probably are going to end up needing

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,440
similar concepts on plasma mobile

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,839
so if you're interested in the talk to

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,839
me

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,599
yeah and then would you recommend

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,640
any in-depth guide or resource in

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,240
statica

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,960
an android tool chain in qt creator or

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,960
okay develop

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,119
not really as i mentioned i learned most

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,839
of the things by just

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
looking at how the binary factory works

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,200
and

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,680
i was meaning to make a good write-up of

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
that

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,000
but i haven't gotten around to do that

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,000
unfortunately

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,000
okay is there

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:58,160
documentation for the simplest test case

00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,640
what's the link on the community wiki

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,599
there is some instructions on how to get

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,119
that done

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,800
i think it's community.kd.org android

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,760
there you should find something

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,200
okay next question should we try to

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,720
incubate

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,200
free open source software native java

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,240
apps

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:26,000
into kde i'm not sure

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:29,359
i would say if there wasn't an app

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,440
like that coming to us and asking to

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,400
join kde i think we should welcome

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,800
it but from a technical point of view a

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,920
lot of the merits that kde

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,640
provides are because our

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,760
our apps share a lot with regarding to

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,400
their tech stack

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,319
and having an app that is completely

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,560
different this regard

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,920
cancels out some of the benefits that

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,920
the kde community brings

00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,319
okay um now

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,680
this is a longer one is is the slash

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:10,240
output path refactoring for apks

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,240
in the android sdk still going forward

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,640
and then we have using ecm to generate

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,960
apks

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,000
directly instead of doing make and make

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,839
create apk

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,400
and potentially rebuilding stuff twice

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,200
so the refactoring i was doing this

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,079
regard is

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,720
done i believe i don't really understand

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,359
the

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:36,640
second part of the question

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,680
because all that make create apk does

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,839
is essentially uh calling android deploy

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,480
cued with the red arguments so i'm not

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,720
sure what to do different there

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,760
there is some upstream cute stuff

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,400
happening

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,960
in the last releases with regards to the

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,000
cmake support of their android stuff

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,440
which is worth exploring but i haven't

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,440
had a time to do that properly

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,640
okay we also had some questions about

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,839
the correct

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,160
room in irc and matrix but someone

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,240
is helpful with that and already

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,520
answered in the shared notes

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,560
um we have some time so um

00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,560
there was a question i skipped um

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,760
someone is asking about showing your

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,920
brother

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,920
well come here to be us

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,280
okay

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,960
um i think it's it's a native matrix

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,440
room

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,079
and i'm not sure it's even possible to

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,680
access

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,800
that from irc as of right now

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,800
but i'm not sure on that

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,800
okay thanks and we got got the brother

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,640
so

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,920
yeah i think we answered all of the

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,920
questions

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,359
and we still have a few minutes so if

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,640
you want to

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,720
um either

00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,920
say something more about this topic or

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,000
maybe we can fetch

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,560
some questions from that chat then yeah

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
go ahead

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,440
yeah i think everyone is just happy that

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,079
they saw

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,079
the brother

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,400
okay i think that's it for the questions

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,119
then

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,480
thank you very much nicolas uploads in

00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:38,079
really a technical talk um

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,960
we're actually kind of newcomers in the

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,000
um

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,440
kde event but

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,200
thanks to alex paul and the other

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,040
friends who

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,040
asked me to work on this

00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,880
framework i decided to do the mobile

00:55:54,319 --> 00:56:01,440
application and desktop application

00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:04,960
on kde and kirigami

00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,280
so let me start

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,720
just by saying what is genu health new

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,680
health is

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,240
first and foremost a social project okay

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,400
with really really cool technology

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,280
but our idea is to deliver social

00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,599
medicine

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,720
freedom and equity in healthcare all

00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,319
around the world

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:27,680
so that's our project um

00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:31,599
we started displaying 2008 so it's

00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,880
more than 12 years now than we win

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:38,480
working with technology

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,440
toward developing and and and delivering

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,440
health

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,079
no matter where you live no matter how

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,319
rich or poor you are

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,319
so

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:54,160
just to give you an idea

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:58,480
is an official new package

00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:01,599
we relied everything on open technology

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,760
and we pride ourselves to have a really

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,640
nice friendly community for all these

00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,160
years

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,960
these are some of the uh environments

00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,920
where you will

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,160
find new health and some of the tools

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,839
and

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,040
frameworks that we use operating system

00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:22,480
freebsd

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:26,559
linux databases postgresql mainly

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:29,599
both relational and document oriented

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,000
functionality programming language

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,920
is not c plus plus in this case we are

00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,319
actually using python

00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,680
and we'll see later when we talk about

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:42,559
specific

00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:47,599
magma tool wikibooks for documentation

00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:51,280
triton for the erp part gnupg4

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:55,040
uh encryption and vgs for

00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,720
the portal there are way many more but

00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,270
this is just a quick

00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,200
review of the most relevant

00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:05,520
[Music]

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,880
tools so new health itself is an

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:11,280
ecosystem

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:15,119
um it basically

00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:19,119
tries to deal with this concept of

00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:22,319
public health and social medicine

00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,640
and collective health at the end of the

00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,839
day

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:29,520
so if if we look at these

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:31,760
four major areas and we start from the

00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,599
bottom the very first part that we do in

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,640
an implementation is work

00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,280
with those social

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,200
determinants of health all those things

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,520
that will make you healthy or will make

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,599
you

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,920
sick so we we work with people

00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,280
before patients we work for on

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,319
demographics

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:56,640
on behalf how you eat where

00:58:52,319 --> 00:59:00,960
you live etc the second layer

00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:03,760
has to do more with additional

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,040
doctor-patient relationship okay that's

00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,440
the

00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,280
ehr the electronic and medical record

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,839
that's where you do

00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:17,359
clinical history that's where you

00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:20,880
make prescriptions order lab tests

00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:24,079
do hospitalizations and so on

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,880
now the third layer has to do with

00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,599
taking care of your health institution

00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,640
itself

00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,480
and that has to do with

00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:38,640
human resources financial accounting

00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,640
stock management then assist

00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,400
the lab itself the lab information

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,520
system

00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,440
um digital imaging and all the things

00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,359
that had to do with

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:54,799
dealing with your resources in your

00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,799
health institution itself

00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,000
and the very last one to this point had

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:03,200
to do with

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,960
making sense of all the data that is has

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,480
been collected

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,559
through the three first ledgers that we

01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,599
just talked okay so the first three ones

01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:16,799
are more transactional type of

01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,799
components and the very last one it's

01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:22,960
more of an analytical statistics

01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:26,319
epidemiology and so on so

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,040
so now we have these four big layers

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:31,040
and there is one more that had to do

01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,720
with the personal health record and

01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,319
that's the the thing that we will be

01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,160
talking today

01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:41,839
and that's where my new health and the

01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,559
and kirigami um and all this really cool

01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:45,200
stuff

01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,200
will show up

01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:52,720
so here you have

01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:55,599
the six main components of

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,520
the ecosystem that makes the new health

01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,880
but the very first one is what we just

01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,400
stopped right the uh health and hospital

01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,440
information system

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,400
but then we also have projects that deal

01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,000
with

01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:13,200
embedding genuine health in

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,200
this is the callus

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:21,040
and we also have the olimex

01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:24,400
here and we have the raspberry pi

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:29,440
images where we can actually

01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:32,960
embed in health on these very small

01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:36,640
single board computers they are

01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,200
very very useful not only in low

01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,839
resource settings but

01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,040
you can actually do very good public

01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,680
health

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,280
promotion campaigns by giving any of

01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,480
these

01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,920
computers to any household any to

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,240
any domiciliary units to be used with

01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,280
my new health we will talk about it

01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,319
later

01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,160
then we have a limbs a large information

01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:06,000
management system

01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:09,480
we also have a set of

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,640
packages or modules that deal with

01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,319
bioinformatics

01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:16,319
with genomics and clinical genetics and

01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,359
medical genetics

01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:24,000
and finally we have the concept of

01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:26,960
my new health federation

01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,160
that's to build large or very large

01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,240
public health

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:32,839
networks distributed networks that we

01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,839
will also talk a little bit more

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,839
afterwards

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:45,079
this is just some snapshots

01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,559
where you can see different uses from

01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:50,400
histopathology

01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:53,440
to calendaring system to some charts

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:57,920
in in global charts

01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:02,880
for pediatrics wristbands for newborns

01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:06,079
digital imaging population pyramid

01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,559
different really different it it's a

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,079
set of functionalities the new health is

01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,760
modular so you can

01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:18,319
choose whatever packages you need to um

01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,319
adapt to your health institution

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,799
this is just another example how we can

01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,079
also work

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:32,319
with our libre

01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:35,440
software projects like oursank for pax

01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:39,119
and daikon so we can actually import

01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,440
those studies into gnu health in real

01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,440
time

01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:49,760
but the reality is and that was what

01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:53,680
took me or led me to write this uh

01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:58,000
this ecosystem this this set of

01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,680
programs because we live in a world

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,960
of injustice and

01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:08,720
what do i mean by that is that

01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,119
as who said nobody should get sick and

01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,640
die

01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,200
because they are poor or because they

01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,039
cannot

01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:20,079
access the health service they need

01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,680
but reality is something completely

01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,200
different of what we wish

01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,240
right and as we would see

01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:31,520
and as we see every single day

01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:34,960
20 000 children around the world die

01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:38,559
from social diseases when i talk about

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:42,160
social diseases i talk about

01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:45,359
illnesses that can be prevented or

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,599
those illnesses that strike

01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,640
the uh undernourished the

01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,079
underprivileged

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:56,640
the poor and we

01:04:52,079 --> 01:05:01,280
as a community have to make sure that

01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:04,720
we lower that number we cannot have

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:08,079
every single day a football stadium

01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:11,599
filled of dead children

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,880
and so some of those social diseases i

01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,720
have put them there

01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,119
are chagas disease prostitution

01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,680
uh human trafficking domestic violence

01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:27,039
hiv aids malaria

01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:30,079
all of those are diseases

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,359
that can be prevented and

01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,160
part of the guinea health social media

01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:37,920
approaches

01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:41,200
work on these to minimize the impact of

01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,200
this type of burden

01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,400
the other problem of course that we deal

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:52,319
with every single day

01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:55,599
is the brutality and animal abuse

01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:59,119
that is not only extremely

01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,200
cruel and but it's also very bad

01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,440
very bad for the environment and for

01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,559
your health so

01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:10,079
it would be great if we stop

01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,880
eating animals just leave them alone

01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:18,319
and we will all be doing much better as

01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:22,799
a society

01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:26,240
now going more into the technical things

01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:28,319
one of the problems we deal today with

01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,599
with our current health information

01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:32,640
system

01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,760
is that information resides

01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:38,240
in silos so i

01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,559
as a physician don't have the

01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,880
information in the canary islands

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,240
from a patient that comes from barcelona

01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,440
or from madrid

01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,839
yes we are from spain but

01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,559
each community has its own databases

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:54,720
their own set of software and so on

01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,559
so one of the things that we need to do

01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:01,359
is to break those silos

01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:03,440
and that's where the federation comes in

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,960
in the concept of collective freedom

01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,200
right that's that's

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,240
as we talk about social media as a

01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,440
collective

01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:15,599
health we talk about libra software

01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:19,039
as collective freedom

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,039
we talk already about this

01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,920
and yeah we'll we will see this concept

01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,440
of

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,880
collaboration based that we

01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:37,200
we see pretty much every day

01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:40,319
in uh i mean of our liver software

01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,319
communities right

01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,319
so this is what we need to do right so

01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,839
if we want to break those silos

01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:49,760
we'll set up this sort of federated

01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,119
distributed

01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:56,880
schema where you can be independent

01:07:53,119 --> 01:08:01,119
at all the epidemiology information

01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:04,240
can be seen in demographical information

01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:07,440
in clinical information at any time

01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:10,240
in any of those

01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,520
health institutions across your region

01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,160
your country

01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,039
or even if we talk about the european

01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,000
union right

01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,679
that should be the way to go and of

01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,920
course and of course use liberty

01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,359
software it makes no sense

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,600
to have proprietary software

01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,400
in the public health system or actually

01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,880
in the

01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,880
public health administration in general

01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,839
for these

01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,440
these are part of the things that are

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:49,040
are already doing new health so you can

01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,359
do real time observatory for example on

01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,880
the

01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,880
on the context of the kobit

01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:57,440
don't need to wait until monday to

01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,759
collect all the data you will have it

01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,480
and that will prevent an outbreak to

01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,600
become

01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,279
an epidemic with the new health

01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,080
federation

01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,719
in place and we also like to

01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,159
contextualize

01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,839
the information so it's we're not just

01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:18,960
talking about

01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:20,000
the immigrant basis of the disease but

01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,600
we are also taking

01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,679
in consideration all these um

01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,759
socio-economic determinants that will

01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,400
actually make a difference on your

01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,920
well-being

01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,920
in your health in general

01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,480
now let's go to the part that you guys

01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,679
might be

01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,679
most interested in that's the

01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,600
latest application part of that

01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,080
ecosystem that we're seeing

01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,120
that we should be able to release the

01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,839
beta on

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:54,880
december so why do we do this well we do

01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:58,320
this because we want the person to be

01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:01,199
in charge of that health okay and that

01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,679
means empowering them to be part of the

01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:06,560
health

01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:09,600
system that will make a huge difference

01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:12,719
so main components

01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,840
are again for the development python we

01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,760
are using

01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:21,360
pi site 2 that's the queue for python

01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:24,880
libraries and tiny db

01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:29,120
to store the information

01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:33,360
ade and kirigami

01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:36,719
to make it um beautiful balls

01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:40,000
on the desktop side as in the

01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:43,600
pine phone that's the um

01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,280
that's the mobile uh are

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:50,960
what we are using at this point to test

01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:54,159
um here we have one and the

01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,679
matplotlib to do all the charting

01:10:54,159 --> 01:11:00,000
new pg as in the main

01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:03,199
her health and hospital information to

01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,480
encrypt and to sign

01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,480
documents or actions

01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,360
these are some of the screenshots

01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:21,520
uh that are taken

01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:25,360
from the um from the desktop itself

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:28,480
okay so as you see

01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:32,000
we have the bio psycho

01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,719
social components that might be always

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,760
present

01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:37,199
in a person's well-being and then if you

01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,400
click on the bio

01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:43,120
it will take you to the um

01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:46,719
you know in this case we are we're

01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:50,080
dealing with things such as

01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:53,199
blood pressure or glucose level

01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,730
or your weight anthropometrics oxygen

01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,560
saturation

01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:59,600
[Music]

01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,480
and then for each of these

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:06,320
you will have your history and this is

01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:09,760
where matplotlib comes into

01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:13,280
there are really cool uh libraries uh

01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,880
for charting in kde

01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:19,840
uh i just chose smartplugly because i

01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,480
knew it and i felt comfortable using it

01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,600
and

01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:28,400
it just plugged in very well so

01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,400
it works it was very well

01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,120
and this is uh

01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,640
this is not a screenshot this is an

01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,679
actual picture

01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:44,250
of the pine phone

01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:46,000
running uh mikey new health

01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:50,220
[Music]

01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,600
on kde neon

01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,320
[Music]

01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,400
and again it's the same exactly the same

01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,159
environment that we use

01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,280
on the desktop it hirigami makes it very

01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,320
very easy

01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:08,880
to just port it to a

01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,880
hardware like the pine the pine pond

01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,159
so when we were talking about the

01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,520
new health federation and if we look on

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,880
the left side

01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:26,159
we will see um

01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,880
that we have in this case we it's

01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:30,560
it's made of of nodes right always you

01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,280
will have nodes and the node can be

01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:37,120
something very large

01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:40,480
like a hospital or can be something

01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:43,760
very personal as it would be

01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,840
the uh the new health

01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,199
personal health record right the good

01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,080
thing about this again is

01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:52,159
it allows the person to be in contact

01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,400
whether it's with your psychologist or

01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:58,080
your doctor or your nurse

01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:00,000
or your social services friends

01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,679
in real time without the need to

01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,120
actually go to the

01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:07,120
to the health institution especially in

01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:10,480
this context of the pandemics it's

01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,480
really really helpful

01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,159
and of course all that information can

01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,159
be actually sent

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,199
to the ministry of health and the

01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,960
information will be

01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:28,480
there in real time so yeah i mean

01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,920
it's one of the reasons we use

01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,719
pine phone is partly because of

01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,920
privacy we want to make sure that every

01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:40,239
single component

01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:43,360
of this personal health record

01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:46,400
it's it's private it's secure respect

01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,000
the privacy and in his liver software

01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,280
and leave the hardware right

01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,640
um we don't use android of course

01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,960
you can compile it for android the same

01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,159
way that we don't use microsoft windows

01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,080
but you can actually

01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:02,880
it's python at the end of the day so you

01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:06,320
could compile the client for the

01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:09,280
new health um client

01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,480
but i always work on on on library

01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,239
software and library

01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,920
hardware i think that is also part of

01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,960
sending out the message

01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:20,239
of the importance of embracing

01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,080
both libra software and libre hardware

01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:26,239
in the public health care i see alice on

01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,840
there so i guess we are running out of

01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,080
time alison

01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,960
now you have five minutes but if you

01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,520
want to answer

01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,800
any q a we can start doing that whenever

01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,080
you're ready

01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:41,199
oh wonderful so let me just

01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:42,719
i will just you will see the the the

01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,760
slides later

01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:49,440
but uh these are some of the

01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:52,800
uh miscellaneous so where is the

01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,800
development environment

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,520
where can you download it where can you

01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,679
reach us

01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,920
and things to do are like you know

01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:06,159
working on a good packaging

01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:09,440
modeling localization of course security

01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,440
and documentation

01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,960
very quickly just

01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,120
[Music]

01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,360
show you some of the projects that we

01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,640
are around the world these are

01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:23,840
from clinic in the rain forest

01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:28,159
very large hospitals in

01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:31,920
india we work with the

01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:34,320
organizations like who

01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,840
we train we have trained them with the

01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,840
united nations university

01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,400
countries like jamaica has adopted the

01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,159
new health

01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,679
in the public health system the red

01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:50,880
cross

01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,880
allows ministry of health 2

01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:58,719
we work with academia and research

01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,719
institutions on the new health alliance

01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,640
and basically that's that's

01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,080
all so we have a couple of minutes now

01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,239
to talk about

01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,800
and and and to answer a couple of

01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:14,080
questions if you have and then

01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:16,320
um of course you can reach me

01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,520
but don't forget that you know this is a

01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,840
medicine is

01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,280
a social science and politics is nothing

01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,320
else but medicine

01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:28,719
on a large scale so

01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:32,080
thank you very much and

01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,719
i'm all ready for your questions if

01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,760
there is

01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,280
or there are any great okay

01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,199
so we have two questions for you the

01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:42,400
first one

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:45,840
says are there any plans or work on

01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:50,440
integrating medical devices and hardware

01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:53,520
to my gnu health anything from the mri

01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:57,440
cbct accusation or

01:17:53,520 --> 01:18:00,640
direct vital monitoring in parentheses

01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,040
like does the bp come directly from the

01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,920
cuff

01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,920
slash monitor

01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,920
right that's that's one of the things we

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,840
want to do

01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,159
with open hardware or or delivery

01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,239
hardware

01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:18,719
and actually the guys that develop

01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:20,800
the pine phone are working now on the

01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:23,199
pine time which is a smart watch

01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,199
that is

01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,159
going to be integrated with new health

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,400
in things like

01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:32,640
your heart rate and things like that but

01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:35,679
we have to make sure that

01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,440
we deal with liver hardware on the other

01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,719
side but absolutely i mean that will

01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,480
reduce

01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:45,520
a lot of human error by typing

01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,520
yes the answer is yes

01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,960
all right next question how does the gnu

01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:56,480
health ecosystem

01:18:50,960 --> 01:19:00,960
deal with gdpr slash hip hop regulations

01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:04,320
well um every country of every region

01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,719
has to do their own localization okay

01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,440
so when it was installed in argentina

01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,520
they deal

01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,360
with their own gdpr for for argentina

01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,800
or anything that has to do with the

01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,600
obvious data

01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,760
hipaa it's for the united states and

01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:23,040
that's something that

01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,560
whoever wants to use it in the united

01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,239
states in the public health i mean you

01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,760
can use it in your private

01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,520
consultation that's no problem but if

01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,560
you want to use it on your

01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:35,040
uh your public health system then you

01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,920
will have to go through the hipaa

01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,960
certification and if they want to pay

01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,840
for it and do it

01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,840
i'll be very happy

01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,960
okay we have two more questions that

01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,640
maybe we can squeeze in

01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,320
i'll start reading the next proprietary

01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,840
hardware is a highly embedded and

01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,880
unavoidable segment

01:19:53,840 --> 01:20:00,080
of the health ecosystem is an

01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,640
all-libris solution really a practical

01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,920
way

01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,280
or advancing the project's goals

01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:09,280
imperfect improvement

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,280
being better than none at all

01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,280
yeah i mean we in in a perfect world

01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:17,520
we we would love everything to be

01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:21,280
liberating

01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:23,440
i am i know that there are many

01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,639
pieces of hardware that are still

01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:29,280
non-libra

01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:32,560
but as long as they can send information

01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,480
in a livery protocol that new health can

01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,960
read it

01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,960
then is on our side to make sure that

01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,760
that information is kept

01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,840
safely and private so we could actually

01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:48,320
interact and interface with them

01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,560
okay well our last question is actually

01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,520
from a fellow academy speaker who had

01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,159
his

01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,040
uh session yesterday his name is ted

01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:58,159
shaw

01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,000
and he is from clear dental

01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:04,000
he asked have you heard of claire dental

01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
a project that we talked about yesterday

01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,520
yes actually i think that i i saw those

01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,639
guys

01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:13,679
in the last um

01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:16,800
new health conference in in

01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:19,360
brussels english but yes i have heard

01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,880
about it and i'm so happy that

01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,600
clear dental is actually using also this

01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,280
sort of

01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,440
similar uh development environment and

01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,040
yeah i mean we should definitely join

01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,480
forces

01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,159
well he did put his linkedin in the

01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,800
shared notes and we'll keep those

01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,880
questions

01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,800
for you on the shared notes if you want

01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:44,239
to stick around and save them

01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,239
uh or save um the linkedin profile

01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:49,040
we are out of time and i would like to

01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,520
thank you very much

and up next we have anika kokar talking

01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:25,840
about change management

01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,840
all right we are coming back with anika

01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,840

so i'm super excited i don't know it's

01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,840
very different topic

01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,840
i'll just check the schedule and i don't

01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,600
know if everybody would like it or not

01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:03,679
wow i think it's good

01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:07,280
i think it's gonna be great i hope so

01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:08,880
no worries that's really dark over here

01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,760
to be honest

01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,480
yeah all right well i think it's time to

01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,320
get going

01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,719
everybody okay with a big round of

01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,960
applause and a nice one welcome to anika

01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:27,840
talking about change management

01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:27,840
thank you

01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,920
all right everyone it looks like we have

01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:09,840
a little technical difficulty

01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:09,840
we will be right back

01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:35,120
all right welcome back and hika can you

01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,120
hear us okay

01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,120
um daniel yummy we can hear you about it

01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,440
clear you're good to go

01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,440
okay

01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,800
so um i'm going to try if my webcam can

01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,840
work but yes it is

01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,239
apologies for the internet connection

01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,639
okay

01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,480
so i want everyone to cross their arms

01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,520
not because it's going to be a lecture

01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,440
or something

01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,040
but it's an experiment that we want to

01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,679
try so

01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,960
please cross your arms and this

01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,080
presentation is going to be really

01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,639
interactive so i

01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,199
really want you guys to do what i'm

01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:21,120
going to

01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:23,360
ask you to do it and before going

01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:25,760
uh to the next slide i want you to tell

01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,080
me what do you think change means

01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:31,360
i know everybody knows the definition

01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:33,520
but if you can just

01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:36,159
write the definition in the chat it will

01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,159
be perfect

01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:43,840
so i really want everyone to write what

01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,840
do they think change means

01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:57,840
yes with arms crossed

01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,360
okay so there are very interesting

01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,800
definitions an opportunity for things to

01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,080
get either better

01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,360
or worse so let's see what the next

01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,520
slide says

01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,560
according to oxford dictionary an actor

01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,960
process through which

01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,880
something becomes different so basically

01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:21,120
it's an actor process

01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:23,840
i am not trying to say that

01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,040
it's something that you guys don't know

01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,159
obviously you know it

01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,840
but it's just that we really want to

01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:32,880
redefine the definition

01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,880
of what change is

01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:39,199
so now again i'm going to ask you to

01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,920
change your arms if you right like to

01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,719
put your

01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,360
arms on your right right hand on your

01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,000
left arm

01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:48,480
so do the opposite so that we can see

01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,840
how do you feel

01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:53,840
so change the direction of your arms

01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:02,000
i'm going to ask you in a while how are

01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,679
you going to feel because then we're

01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,239
going to do another experiment

01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,120
so before change management i would like

01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:09,360
to ask you

01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,400
actually to recall when you were in

01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,719
school

01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,480
in fact i'm sure your parents must have

01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,719
shared these kind of stories that when

01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,480
you were in preschool how did you feel

01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,400
when you were going to the school

01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,000
did you cry on your first day or were

01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,360
you happy

01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,199
i am definitely sure that

01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,960
a lot of people were not happy and they

01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,719
were crying

01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,480
that's the same scenario when you move

01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:34,080
from school to high school some people

01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,760
are really excited for the change

01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,920
some people are sad because they are

01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,480
going to lose their friends

01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,400
and um when you move from your college

01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,880
to professional life

01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,560
how was it your first day in the office

01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,239
just think your first day

01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,480
i'm sure a lot of people have not

01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:55,280
started their professional lives

01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:55,280
but if anyone can just relate to it

01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:01,440
okay so how about changing your phone

01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,080
have you guys change your phone recently

01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,960
or in your

01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,239
life what was the feeling were you

01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,199
excited

01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:10,159
of course if you were moved to a little

01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:12,880
uh

01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:15,040
i would say degraded one or a lower uh

01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,440
phone then you must have felt awkward

01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:19,120
but if you upgraded your phone you must

01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:21,360
have felt really nice

01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:23,040
changing your house changing your cities

01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,480
if you would ask me right now i've

01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,040
changed my house and my

01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,040
city country everything so it's a very

01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:32,320
different change for me

01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:35,679
so another change which i felt right now

01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:39,440
is that i've moved too fast and

01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:41,760
how did i feel about first topic but

01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,719
just imagine that when you come to a new

01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,679
organization

01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:47,280
it's very different right so if a new

01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,360
cover comes to kde

01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,719
try to imagine how that person feel try

01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,199
to be me

01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,560
that how was the feeling to be part of

01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:57,600
boss community

01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,400
particularly when i joined i heard about

01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,080
gitlab

01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,719
and git lab when it was migrating to

01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,639
gitlab

01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:05,920
a lot of people loved fabricator and

01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,719
they really didn't want to move to

01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,040
gitlab

01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,639
and i'm sure that it was an awkward

01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:15,040
feeling and it took

01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:15,040
really long for you to accept this fact

01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:23,440
so why do we hate change um i would

01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,000
really want you to write that why do you

01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,239
want to

01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,239
why do you hate change so start typing

01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:29,920
why do you hate change

01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:31,520
a lot of people these are not something

01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,679
which i am saying

01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,800
but a lot of theories have said that

01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,880
people hate change

01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,960
because they believe that they are going

01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,960
to give up on their beliefs

01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,440
because they are really loyal to their

01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,080
beliefs do you remember your mother if

01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,800
she bought

01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,080
some brand and even your wife or

01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,679
yourself

01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:53,920
and all the females or all the

01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,800
gentlemen who have bought new brands of

01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,760
i would say

01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:59,760
food or clothes you were a little

01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,280
nervous about it because you were used

01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,760
to your old brands

01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,400
because you were loyal to it sometimes

01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,960
you feel

01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:09,280
surrender to someone you really don't

01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,600
want to uh go for it

01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,639
so there are mixed feelings you feel

01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:16,400
feared you feel

01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:16,400
guilty you are in doubt

01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:21,120
i know the world hates change but this

01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,239
is the only way

01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:26,320
you can progress so you really need to

01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:28,639
start thinking how can you actually

01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,639
change

01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,480
okay right now i'm asking you guys if

01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,920
you want to just

01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,920
don't want to cross your arms it's fine

01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,880
but i'm sure it must have been super

01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,760
awkward

01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,159
because change is here trust me it's

01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,800
your mind how you actually train it

01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:48,400
so what are the benefits of change now

01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,120
we are going to move towards it

01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,199
if we were talking about hate now we are

01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:56,320
going to talk about change

01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:58,159
so basically if you think

01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,719
this is a very nice picture if you see

01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:04,159
that change is basically a chance

01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:06,480
so it can help you promoting new skills

01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,840
i'm sure a lot of people can relate here

01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,960
when we moved from

01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,880
um fabricator to get that learned a new

01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,920
skill you learned a new software you

01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:19,360
learned a new environment

01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:22,239
it helps innovation and it also allows

01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,239
you to progress

01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:31,280
so before you are in such a situation

01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:33,760
think about uh how do you feel yourself

01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:35,120
when you are in such circumstances do

01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,600
you think that you are doing

01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,280
a right thing according to this picture

01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,159
these people are thinking that maybe

01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,239
something

01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:43,920
will happen and they don't have to

01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:46,960
change but trust me

01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:49,760
without change you cannot move in life

01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,880
this is a cycle of change if something

01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,360
is constant

01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,800
and you need you will feel a dip and a

01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,880
transition and you will feel

01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,400
really bad about it but then there is a

01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:02,000
new beginning always

01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:04,239
and again because change is not constant

01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,760
every time everything has to change and

01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,760
that's how the world is moving

01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,840
so now we'll come back to the main point

01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:16,159
that how

01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:19,360
i'm going to actually accept change

01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:21,920
accepting change is uh

01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:23,040
as i've just read the comments that

01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,760
somebody has read

01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:27,840
written that you cannot actually think

01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,520
that changes are always better i agree

01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,960
totally and i'm going to talk about that

01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,600
as well right now

01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,920
so you need to acknowledge the change it

01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:38,800
did not mean that you have to like

01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,199
choose or support just try to understand

01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,719
what

01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:43,920
is the change why is it and why do you

01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,600
need to change

01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:50,159
try to be flexible try to embrace it

01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,840
as i said changes consider it's going to

01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:55,840
come again and again in your life

01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:58,159
you are going to change

01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:00,239
think that you are not changing trust me

01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:01,920
you as i told you that how your school

01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,639
life changed how your professional life

01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,239
changed

01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:07,040
everything is changed so if you feel

01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:09,040
that

01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,040
you're not going to change express it

01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:13,040
express your fears and the feelings

01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,119
communication is the key of success so

01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:18,080
you really need to communicate

01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:18,400
and the i would say the best thing is to

01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,560
be

01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,320
optimistic about it if from the

01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,080
beginning you're thinking that it's not

01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:26,880
going to work out it will not work

01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:28,719
out so you really really need to have a

01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,800
positive feeling about it you need to

01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:33,199
have a positive attitude

01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,639
also you really need to understand that

01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,480
it's an active process

01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:37,840
it's not something which we are going to

01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,000
just discuss right now in

01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,840
20 minutes and you will start doing it

01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,400
and you will learn change management

01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,520
not at all because it's actually a long

01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,760
long process

01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,080
it will go on and on so you need to

01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:54,239
start changing your attitude towards

01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:54,239
experience people ideas

01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,800
okay so that was a side where we talked

01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,800
about accepting the change

01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,520
what if you are on the opposite side and

01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:06,239
you are implementing the change

01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,159
so what are you going to do first of all

01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:09,679
you need to start with the end in mind

01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,800
you need to think that okay this is

01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:13,840
something which we

01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,199
are going to do now currently we are

01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,679
talking about kde

01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:18,239
so if you are thinking to start a new

01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:21,600
project

01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:22,639
or if you have a new task understand

01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,480
kd's culture

01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,400
understand the organization's culture

01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,280
where you're going to implement it

01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,920
how people are going to react to it

01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,400
again

01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,360
in this way in this method also you need

01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,600
to communicate

01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,280
communicate communicate if you are not

01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,400
going to communicate the benefits to the

01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,760
people they would never

01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,840
understand i don't know if um

01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,639
in your school it happened or not but i

01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,159
remember my teacher she appointed most

01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,560
naughtiest scared in the class as

01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:52,159
monitor because she thought that if he

01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,440
will be in control the whole class will

01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:55,520
be in control

01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:57,280
so if you think that somebody is there

01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,159
who is going to be the most resistant

01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,920
person

01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:02,159
try to talk to him first so that he

01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:05,440
doesn't take the same attitude

01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:06,880
to others so you need to uh take in

01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,280
in confidence take him or her in

01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,159
confidence and if you have some

01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,639
supporters

01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:14,400
you need to understand their values as

01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:17,920
well and you need to

01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:20,159
uh i would say embrace them try to walk

01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,679
in their shoes understand why they are

01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:24,000
hating change

01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,760
create a win-win situation if i'm

01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,840
implementing something in kte and i'm

01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,000
just talking about kg's progress

01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,520
i need to talk about kt communities

01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,280
progress as well

01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,840
just can't say that okay if you're going

01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:37,679
to bring this change we will be

01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:40,080
shown over there or somewhere but we

01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,679
need to understand how the community can

01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,760
also benefit from it

01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,719
so the best thing i'm sure the project

01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,560
managers

01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,000
with us right now would understand this

01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,800
that any project

01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,080
is actually divided into small steps and

01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,920
it's measurable

01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:56,480
so if you're implementing a change you

01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:59,920
really need to do that

01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:02,719
now i'm going to um

01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,600
see a share something really interesting

01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:05,760
with you

01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,840
so what are you going to do right now is

01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,639
if you have a paper and pen

01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:13,199
just start writing the changes in your

01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,760
life you have seen if not now

01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,400
then what you can do is that whenever

01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,760
after

01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,080
and you think someday or maybe in your

01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,880
life

01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:24,320
you are going to face a change and you

01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,400
don't know how to react

01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,360
so you are going to use that candy jar

01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,480
and you're going to put

01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,960
all these in that jar and whenever you

01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,040
feel

01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,840
that you are not able to accept that

01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:39,040
change you can just read it out

01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:41,440
and trust me this will help you

01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,400
and always remember that without

01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,440
accepted

01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:47,360
opportunities sleep slip away so

01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,800
um i don't know if you guys have heard

01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:52,719
about kodak film

01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:55,760
uh case kodak was a top-notch company

01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:58,239
when we had film cameras but

01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,920
when there was an industry revolution

01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:01,760
all the cameras

01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,280
moved to digital cameras and what

01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,840
happened kodak

01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,719
didn't react at that time and they said

01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,840
that

01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:13,600
film cameras will be the one in the

01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:15,840
world and it didn't happen completely

01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,520
gone from the market they could have

01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,280
reacted in a different way

01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,639
they could have launched memory cards

01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,119
they could have launched anything

01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:24,960
else but they didn't so you could see

01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:28,239
what has happened with kodak

01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:30,719
similarly same thing happened with nokia

01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:32,159
you have seen that android has changed

01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:35,920
the world right now

01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:38,639
and nokia didn't implement needs

01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,159
and nokia has manokia's market share has

01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:43,119
gone

01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:44,320
so i think if you really want to

01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:46,480
understand

01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:48,800
why change management is important you

01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:51,280
really need to understand

01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,920
i would say that you really need to

01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,639
understand

01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,280
the critical role of change management

01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:57,040
so

01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,320
if you think that you really want to

01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,520
implement something

01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:05,679
you can plan you can control and adjust

01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:08,239
do it so create a stronger working

01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:10,719
relationship with newcomers i know that

01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:12,719
including me i would say paul and yokos

01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:13,280
were really supportive and because of

01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,880
them

01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:19,600
i was able to otherwise

01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,199
be initially when i joined as a newcomer

01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,719
in the fast community it wouldn't have

01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:25,679
been easier for me

01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:27,199
so whenever a newcomer comes try to

01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,679
understand they are coming from a

01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,760
different

01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,760
operating system environment it will

01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,920
take time for them to adjust

01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,119
it's easy for everyone to come to the

01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,760
force environment

01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:39,760
because as i said change is here and we

01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,920
have been using certain systems or

01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,800
certain processes for a very very long

01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,520
time

01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,000
and moving shifting to the process is

01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,760
not that

01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,880
easy secondly to think

01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:55,040
that something which is coming and it's

01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,639
not good or beneficial for kte or

01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:59,119
community express

01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,159
it's okay you really don't have to say

01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:03,760
that that

01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:06,239
okay you don't have to

01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,960
uh implement this right now just try to

01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,560
understand

01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,840
that why this person is not reacting the

01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,719
way you want it

01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,920
so remember that the success factors of

01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,159
change

01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,679
the person i would say is you and the

01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,800
person who's implementing so the

01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:23,360
accepted

01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,320
element both have to understand why

01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,600
change management

01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:29,760
is important so

01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,119
in the end i would say accept the things

01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,600
you cannot change

01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:34,159
and change the things you can because

01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,159
it's

01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,520
you the one who would decide either you

01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:40,719
want to go for a new way

01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:43,280
or an overview i think i have

01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:44,960
done my presentation pretty earlier so

01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:50,320
if you have any questions

01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:50,320
alison do you want to join absolutely

01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,880
thank you so much for that that was

01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,840
really

01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,840
mind opening

01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,719
thank you just trying to get my camera

01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:07,280
back on

01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,280
okay all right

01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,320
okay so we have a question and it says

01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,760
as new to kde

01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,760
10.1

01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:21,119
yeah can you point one thing you believe

01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:25,840
we should change in order to improve

01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:25,840
oh my god that's a debatable topic

01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:31,440
i think whatever changes i feel i have

01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,880
been sharing that

01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:36,719
now and then publicly whatever i've felt

01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,159
i have shared that in the promo groups

01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,560
i've shared that

01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:42,159
uh with everyone so that's not something

01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,520
i can say one thing or

01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:46,239
something i think as a community katie

01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,480
is

01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:49,280
impressed that we work all along

01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,960
together

01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,840
so i really don't think that there's one

01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:57,920
thing i could say

01:43:53,840 --> 01:44:01,119
i'd have to agree as all and also

01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,119
kitty but

01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:07,840
uh i just said how diplomatic i know

01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,320
we're just gonna start calling anika the

01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:16,800
diplomat

01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:21,840
yeah it's okay that's who i am

01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:21,840
well if there's no more questions

01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:30,000
maybe there are some in the public chat

01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,880
yeah we've got lots of great comments

01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,719
though

01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,000
yes because i really wanted to keep it

01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,600
interactive because

01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,040
change management is not something which

01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,040
i can teach as a lecturer

01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,199
what change would you make to kde

01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,280
what i think yeah that's a question in

01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:52,639
the comments from jonathan i

01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:56,000
see yeah so i think

01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:59,600
right now we are working on kde and

01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:03,840
i really want that to work out and

01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,840
that's for you as well alison

01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:11,600
paul just said that i didn't say

01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:16,159
anything he's just written good question

01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:17,920
for alison too

01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:19,840
we have another question maybe some

01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:23,679
quick poll about the gitlab

01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:23,679
change that me too

01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,080
up to you if you would like to host yes

01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,960
yes

01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:33,440
so how are you excited or not excited

01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,440
let's see

01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:40,480
okay adam says how to change when it

01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,320
affects

01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:47,360
a lot of people like a community

01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:50,400
okay so as i said that you really

01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:51,360
can't change something overnight you

01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,920
really need to

01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:55,440
understand the dynamics of the community

01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,719
and you need to

01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:02,000
show them how beneficial it is for them

01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:04,400
not the way uh you pursue it

01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,360
right if you think that your perception

01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,119
is the same way

01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,639
it's not because trust me the other

01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:10,639
person who's going to

01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:12,000
receive the change will not take it so

01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:13,679
you really need to do

01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,199
it in a way that the whole community and

01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,560
if you think that whole community can be

01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:18,400
happy it cannot be

01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,159
you really need to go with authority and

01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,560
you have to try to show them the

01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:25,600
positivity

01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,560
i hope i have answered adam's question i

01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,639
think so

01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,719
he can always answer a follow-up he says

01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:33,040
yes okay

01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,440
has a question for you too he says would

01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:38,400
you say kde is accepting to change

01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,440
based on your experience so far and the

01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,119
suggestions

01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:46,080
you made what was your experience

01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:46,719
okay that's a long question so i would

01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:50,000
say that

01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:50,400
yes i have seen a lot of changes um like

01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,719
for

01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,000
instagram i have started posting a lot

01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:56,880
there was i think the first

01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,920
change which i tried to implement yes

01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,880
and i said that

01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,840
always uh you cannot be right like in my

01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,239
case as well

01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,920
if i am um saying that okay this is

01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:06,800
something which should be changed maybe

01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,719
i'm wrong

01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,320
so i need to even understand that

01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:12,639
whether i'm right or wrong

01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:14,800
so the other thing which i said is about

01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:16,560
kde network and i was very happy that

01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,000
everybody was really receptive and

01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,239
supportive about it

01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,159
so i would say my experience experience

01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:24,960
has been really good up till now

01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:25,199
and trust me it shows on my face it even

01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,280
though

01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:29,360
i'm diplomatic my show's on my face if

01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:31,280
i'm not happy

01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,480
all right adam asks anika what is your

01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:37,600
hardest change how did you handle it

01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:38,880
okay so right now is my hardest change

01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:42,239
to be honest because

01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,520
i have um i'm living here all alone my

01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:46,560
family's in pakistan

01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,600
and i've changed my country i've moved

01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,639
from my family

01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:53,119
so yes it's the hardest change right now

01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:55,760
and there was corona so i was all alone

01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:58,719
in this house

01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,719
i feel your pain

01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:07,600
um miyakito says as a follow-up i think

01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,920
so we should be accepting to proposals

01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,960
for

01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,000
change as well and adam is sending

01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:18,480
virtual hugs

01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:21,600
and so is paul thank you so much

01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,040
uh we do have time or are we done we

01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,080
have a couple more minutes

01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:28,400
so we can answer more questions

01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,600
i think that's like really interactive

01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:31,679
such and trust me

01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,440
because i really didn't think that it

01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:36,480
will end so soon

01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:38,639
although i had an internet touch as well

01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:41,360
well i think that's okay because

01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:44,560
everyone more time to interact with you

01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,840
what do you miss from windows i never

01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,040
work for windows so

01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:50,560
yes windows operating system i miss it

01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:53,920
of course because

01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:56,080
um as i said james is here right so

01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,520
uh it's very difficult for me i am in

01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:00,560
the transition pace right now

01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,440
from windows to plasma so the only thing

01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,440
which i miss

01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:06,000
paul you know is that the mic thing

01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:09,119
because whenever i turn the mic

01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,800
on my plasma it just disturbs me

01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:13,119
so that's the only thing which i miss in

01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,639
the windows

01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:16,239
we have a comment that says you've been

01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:18,639
doing great on promo and that is

01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:19,840
something i absolutely agree a thousand

01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,159
percent

01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,560
thank you so much we have another

01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:26,800
question maybe our last question

01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,000
how do you gather quality feedback from

01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:31,280
those who are being asked

01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:35,119
to undergo a change i.e polls

01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:36,639
focus groups etc okay so it totally

01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:39,920
depends on the community

01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:42,880
if you think that your community is uh

01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:44,719
to be honest receptive or intellectual

01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,320
enough to go for a focus group

01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,159
um you can go for a focus group and if

01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,880
you think that polls will be much easier

01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:50,719
for them

01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:53,040
so you can go for polls because see it

01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:54,480
depends if you are from a technical side

01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,599
or a non-technical side

01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,719
and if you are going to ask a

01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:01,119
non-technical person about technical

01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:03,280
in the focus group it will not be easy

01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:05,440
so you really need to understand

01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,719
uh i wouldn't say that there will be one

01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,360
exact measure for

01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:11,840
community you need to have you have to

01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,840
see what

01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,320
i hope that answers i don't know let's

01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:20,480
see if

01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,480
hudson sends anything

01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:28,320
yes maybe

01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:29,520
i said believe so and thank you thank

01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,159
you

01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,440
and i repeat adam's comment thanks for

01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:36,480
the awesome talk

01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:39,679
yes absolutely thank you anika

01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:42,159
thank you i hope uh

01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:44,159
we will try to make a change in our life

01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:47,760

01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:49,119

01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,679
only time

01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:56,719

uh thanks everyone for having me um

01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:35,199
i'd like to talk a little bit about

01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:38,080
copyright and licenses

01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:39,520
and then open source science and

01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:42,320
responsibilities

01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,800
and finally about open change we do that

01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,880
maybe

01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,880
a very background i'm a lawyer by

01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:50,239
training i started my career in

01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:51,440
licensing and especially open content

01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:55,760
and open source

01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:58,880
licenses a long long time ago when i was

01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:01,760
an international actor at commons

01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:04,480
today i'm a strategic adventurer at

01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:07,760
emerson which is a diamond subsidiary

01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,239
working on software for the car i run a

01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,159
company

01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:12,800
in the site called the software science

01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:14,080
academy and i'm a strategic advisor to

01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,719
the open chain project

01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:19,119
um which is one of the reasons that i'd

01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:22,000
like to introduce the tft

01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:22,880
for a disclaimer i'm not speaking of

01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,760
ambition

01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,800
because ambition decides sponsor this

01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,679
event

01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:31,119
after my class proposed and accepted so

01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:34,239
i'm i'm grateful for

01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:37,599
um being part of this today but

01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:40,719
everything presented is my own thanks

01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:42,800
um so when we talk about copyright um

01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:45,119
probably almost every roast that

01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:46,400
software is protected by copyright so

01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:49,199
that means that

01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:50,239
the create the author basically the

01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:52,880
developer

01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:54,320
all the exclusive right to decide what

01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:56,480
to do with the software

01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,000
you may all be very familiar with this

01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:01,520
little icon the c

01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,360
in a circle which is originated from the

01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,080
us and it basically means all rights

01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,440
reserved

01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:11,119
so you want to use the software

01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:14,400
you need to negotiate and agree

01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:15,040
a license that gives you the rights to

01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,239
use

01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:20,960
software um you read that

01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:21,760
with many projects that are out there

01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,920
and available

01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,760
somewhere on the web whenever there's no

01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,520
license attached to the software

01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,440
basically the default is that you are

01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:30,480
not allowed to use it so you need a

01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,159
license

01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:35,360
and then see what you can do with the

01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:37,119
software um the particularities for open

01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:39,920
source

01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:41,520
they sizes standardized and therefore

01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:43,760
they should be easy to read and to

01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:46,800
memorize even if that's not the case for

01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,920
today's licenses they are a direct

01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,719
license

01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:52,000
meaning the rights are always granted

01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:55,280
from the developer

01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,040
directly even if you may receive the

01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:00,000
software itself

01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:03,280
from third party which could be a vendor

01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:06,480
so you can receive the software from

01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:09,599
any kind of but that's um

01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:12,800
come always from the developer from the

01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:14,719
creator author of this software in the

01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,719
european context

01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:19,520
um based on the continental european

01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:20,719
cost an open source license is also a

01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,480
contract

01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:25,199
that means that you know by offering the

01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:28,560
software

01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:31,360
under a license you basically

01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,480
give someone the offer to use it and

01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:36,159
that person can

01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:36,639
accept the offer by using the software

01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:40,400
which

01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:40,800
can be um done confidently right so you

01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:43,520
don't

01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,280
need to sign anything you don't need to

01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:47,599
officially accept anything that's

01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,400
that's being done just by using the

01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:50,719
software

01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:52,400
this is the concept of open source

01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:53,520
license and this is officially

01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,520
recognized

01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,639
by many different german courts i think

01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,639
the first

01:58:56,639 --> 01:59:00,239
court decision to deal with this kind of

01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:02,480
analysis was

01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:05,280
the district court of munich back in

01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:07,040
2004. so this is a very old concept and

01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:09,760
there's no doubt about

01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:12,080
what um open source licenses mean in the

01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:12,639
german context and the european context

01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,560
and

01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:17,040
especially also in the u.s context

01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:20,800
around the world

01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:24,480
so most of the open source licenses

01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:25,040
grant very similar even almost the same

01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,880
rights

01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:28,080
and that's defined by the four freedoms

01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,679
according to the free software

01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,679
foundation or if you look up the open

01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:34,080
source definition you will find that

01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:35,520
almost all open source licenses give you

01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:38,719
the right to use

01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:41,440
copy distribute and modify the software

01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:43,040
however most of them come with different

01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:45,520
obligations

01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:47,679
and some of the very familiar

01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:49,360
obligations are the copyright notices

01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:50,159
that you have to provide or you can

01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:52,320
provide this

01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:54,159
code to make the source code available

01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,840
one of the more complicated ones is the

01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:58,239
so-called copy left

01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,800
but there are different um license

01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:02,880
obligations depending on which license

02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:06,320
you are looking at and that makes it

02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,880
somewhat difficult um most

02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:10,639
context or most companies i've been

02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:12,800
working with is

02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:15,040
saying that oh yeah we understand most

02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,880
of the open source licenses we know what

02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,800
we can do with it but they forgot

02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:20,560
that you know they also have to fulfill

02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:23,199
the license obligations

02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,920
and here's just one example um from the

02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:26,960
gpl

02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:27,840
which sounds very easy in the first

02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,599
right but

02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:31,599
when you look into the details and you

02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:32,719
start thinking about how to do this in

02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:35,199
practice

02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:37,199
um then it gets quite complicated right

02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:38,960
so the sense that you may copy and

02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:40,960
distribute beverage copies of the

02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,920
program source code as you receive it in

02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,960
any medium

02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:47,280
provided that you consciously and

02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:49,599
appropriately publish on each copy

02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:51,119
and appropriate copyright notice and

02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:53,520
disclaimer of warranty

02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:55,040
keep intact all the notices that refer

02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,679
to this license

02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,080
and to the absence of any warranty and

02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:00,719
give

02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:02,639
any other recipients of the program a

02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:03,520
copy of this license along with the

02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:05,840
program

02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,880
so you are allowed to use the software

02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,920
but there are some

02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:10,480
obligations and the same is true for

02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,239
something

02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:14,239
a little more complicated which is the

02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:17,280
copy left right so

02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:19,440
um in the gpl again gpl2 it says

02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:20,800
you must cause any work that you

02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:23,679
distribute or publish

02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,080
that and whole or impart contains or is

02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:26,960
derived from the program or any part

02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:30,239
thereof

02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:31,440
to be licensed as a whole at no charge

02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:34,400
to all parties

02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:36,639
under the terms of this license now what

02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:39,840
exactly does this mean

02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:41,599
and how do you handle this in reality

02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,320
well when we talk about software

02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:46,400
compliance in a corporate context

02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:48,800
that means that you have to look at many

02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:50,320
different software licenses right so you

02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:53,360
have a bunch of proprietary

02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:56,000
licenses there you tend to negotiate

02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,639
individual license fees and volumes and

02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,880
you have

02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:01,679
a big chunk of open source licenses

02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:05,119
where you need to understand and comply

02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:06,639
with the respective license obligations

02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:08,880
when you look at the open source

02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:10,719
licenses individually

02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:12,080
you need to make sure that you also

02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:14,239
understand if they are

02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,760
interoperable right so different

02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:18,880
copyleft licenses

02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:22,159
may not be interoperable with each other

02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:25,520
so it's always important to look into

02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:29,280
all the details of the respective

02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:31,440
copyleft license for example gpl3

02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:33,599
and eclipse and so on and so forth to

02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:35,360
understand if you can use components

02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:37,280
coming from different sources under

02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:38,800
different licenses together in one

02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:42,560
project

02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:45,599
so what happens if you forget or maybe

02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:49,119
intentionally neglect some of these

02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:51,840
licensed obligations that

02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:52,960
means that you are not only in breach

02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,159
the license

02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:58,960
and the contract it also means that you

02:02:56,159 --> 02:03:01,840
end up in a copyright violation

02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:03,280
and this is because most of the licenses

02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,440
or i should say almost

02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,119
all licenses are designed that way but

02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:10,679
some of the licenses

02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:11,840
explicitly stated for example in the

02:03:10,679 --> 02:03:14,560
gpl3

02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,119
you have explicitly said that you may

02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:18,880
not

02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:22,800
propagate or modify a covered work

02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:23,520
except as expressly provided under this

02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,480
license

02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,599
any attempt otherwise to proper guide or

02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:30,480
modify it

02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:31,280
is void and will automatically terminate

02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:34,000
your rights

02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:34,880
under this license so that means the

02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,599
moment

02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,480
you are not observing the license

02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:41,040
obligations

02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:42,719
the license itself is gone and that

02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,840
means that you are using a piece of

02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:45,679
software

02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:47,119
where you don't have the rights to use

02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:50,880
it right

02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:52,960
so in a legal analysis and the legal

02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:56,000
construction this means that rights

02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:58,880
are granted only under the you can call

02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,800
it resolutive condition that the license

02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,320
obligations are met and when the license

02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,280
obligations are not met

02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:06,480
then the license is void and is gone and

02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:08,800
the consequences

02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:11,040
um you can find in the civil law and in

02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:14,000
the criminal law and

02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:16,320
this is something more heavy i would say

02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,599
in layman's speech

02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:22,639
than just a breach of contract

02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:25,280
as a legal consequences we can find

02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:28,400
possible claims by the rights orders so

02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:31,440
for example injunctive relief

02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:34,239
the right to information

02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:36,320
compensation of course reimbursement of

02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:38,239
costs

02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:41,280
perhaps you have to disclose some of

02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:43,360
your own source code if you have not

02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:45,440
worked with the gpr correctly or any

02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:49,440
other copyleft

02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:52,239
license and these details have all been

02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:54,159
enforced by german courts right so i

02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:56,239
put the the district court of munich

02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:57,840
above but there are also other decisions

02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,880
by the district court of balloon for

02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:02,239
example

02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:05,280
and in other courts in germany

02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:07,199
now who is responsible for license

02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:08,320
compliance and for open source

02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:11,440
compliance

02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:13,760
this is a tricky question of course

02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:15,199
every individual developer who's working

02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:18,079
with open source should

02:05:15,199 --> 02:05:20,639
you know understand the licenses and

02:05:18,079 --> 02:05:23,199
comply with the license obligations

02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:25,199
in a corporate context it is also

02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:28,480
important to understand that

02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:30,400
it's usually the management who's

02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:34,000
responsible for

02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:36,880
open source compliance and we can find

02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,360
that in the german context again on the

02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,400
act

02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:43,199
in the act on regulatory offenses

02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:44,480
um which is in german the otnom sweeter

02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:46,560
gazettes

02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:48,000
but we can also find it in other laws

02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,960
like the action gazettes

02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,920
the the legal acts on corporations in

02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:55,199
germany

02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,520
and they all stay the same meaning that

02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:58,719
the

02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:02,239
owner of an operation or undertaking

02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:05,360
or any company has to take

02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:06,320
the supervisionary measures required to

02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:09,199
prevent

02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:11,760
any breach of law let me just put it in

02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:13,599
close with you because the german law

02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:17,040
um and the language used there is

02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:20,880
usually a little complicated

02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:24,079
so um it's not only the authentic

02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:26,079
gazettes or the the act i quoted before

02:06:24,079 --> 02:06:26,960
it's only the stock corporation act

02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:30,800
which says it

02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:33,280
more um explicitly the management board

02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:37,679
has to take suitable measures

02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:40,880
um and it's responsible and it's

02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:44,079
one of the duties is to be liable

02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:46,800
for any damage resulting from not

02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:48,400
working on specific measures so again

02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,480
the legal language is a little

02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:51,280
complicated i give you the full language

02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:54,639
here

02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:56,880
for your own studies but

02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:58,320
what you need to take away from this

02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,199
talk is that

02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:03,199
you know all of these laws have also

02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:05,119
been enforced by

02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:07,280
another court decision and in this case

02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:11,440
it's the district code of munich again

02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:14,079
who ordered a former zimas management

02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:16,320
a member to pay for 15 million in

02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:18,320
damages for the breach of duty with

02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:19,280
regards to an inadequate compliance

02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:22,079
system

02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:22,719
so this was the first court decision in

02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:26,719
germany

02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:29,199
that really detailed out

02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:30,480
the requirements for a compliance system

02:07:29,199 --> 02:07:32,480
in that case

02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:34,639
compliance was not about license

02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:37,760
compliance in the open source context

02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:38,840
it was in the general context of what

02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:42,480
are the duties

02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:46,000
of proper management but you can take

02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:46,800
all of these requirements and apply it

02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,560
to

02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,239
license compliance in the open source

02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,719
context

02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:54,000
it means that basically whenever you

02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:56,560
talk about open

02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:59,280
source compliance compliance as a

02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:01,920
general fact is a matter for the boss

02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:04,239
the management is responsible for a

02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:06,560
functioning compliance system

02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:09,040
and details and specific form of the

02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:11,040
compliance system depend on the type the

02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:13,760
size and the organization of the company

02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:17,599
so for example a company like siemens

02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:19,520
may have to fulfill with a different

02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:22,079
type of compliance management system

02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:25,040
than a smaller organization or a startup

02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:26,480
it also depends on the type of relevant

02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:29,040
laws and regulations

02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:30,960
and here i would say that copyright law

02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:32,880
is a very important

02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:35,280
law and intellectual property plays a

02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:38,560
big role

02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:41,679
in today's business um it also

02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:44,400
uh gives one another

02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:46,079
another very important aspect of a

02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:48,960
compliance management system

02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:51,760
is the grounds for suspicion and the

02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:54,560
cases for non-compliance in the past

02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:56,560
and in germany we all know that we have

02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,239
a lot of compliance cases

02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:00,639
in the in the context of open source

02:08:58,239 --> 02:09:03,199
going on so any court would say well

02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:04,079
you know um in in the context of open

02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:06,159
source compliance

02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:09,199
there has actually been some grounds for

02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:12,400
suspicions in the past

02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:12,719
um of course delegation is possible so

02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,560
the

02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:16,320
the management does not have to do

02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,599
everything by themselves they can

02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:20,639
delegate

02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:21,599
but they are responsible for monitoring

02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:23,280
and

02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:24,960
making sure that you know the the

02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:28,159
compliance processes

02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:31,360
work and that can again be

02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:32,079
justified through periodic internal or

02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:34,800
external

02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:35,840
audits and readjustments of specific

02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:40,480
management

02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:43,520
processes now in reality

02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:46,560
i like to show this slide which i

02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:48,320
use it's originally from the linux

02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:49,760
foundation and i think it shows quite

02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:53,199
nicely what today's

02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:56,480
status of the supply chain is basically

02:09:53,199 --> 02:09:59,760
suppliers are not really giving

02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:00,480
complete licensing information and this

02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:04,639
information

02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:07,119
by no way in any standardized

02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:07,679
um and when you have to deal with open

02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:11,199
source

02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:11,920
uh packages then the basic problem is

02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:14,320
that

02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:16,320
um you kind of tried to ask everybody

02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:18,400
that has really been already analyzed by

02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:21,199
one of your suppliers before so it's

02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,159
a double effort and then depending on

02:10:21,199 --> 02:10:24,719
your customers

02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:25,760
um they want uh some kind of uh

02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,719
information

02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,800
a bill of materials and then usually

02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:32,800
most customers have their own way of

02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:35,440
asking for a bill of materials so

02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:39,199
there's no center this way again

02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:42,079
and this was the starting point

02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:42,480
for a small group thinking about how can

02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:45,199
we

02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:48,960
how can we reduce friction and

02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:48,960
transaction costs in this

02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:54,480
current status and this is exactly when

02:10:52,159 --> 02:10:56,560
the open chain project was born

02:10:54,480 --> 02:11:00,239
you can find all the necessary

02:10:56,560 --> 02:11:03,679
information at openchainproject.org

02:11:00,239 --> 02:11:08,239
basically open chain is an iso 9000

02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:11,760
9001 like conformity assessment standard

02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:15,119
so it provides a specification that

02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:16,760
um asks you or asked you to

02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:18,320
know your own open source

02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:21,040
responsibilities

02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:22,480
to assign responsibility for it in

02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:25,599
compliance

02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:28,719
to review and approve

02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:29,199
the relevant open source content and

02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:32,000
then

02:11:29,199 --> 02:11:34,000
to deliver open source documentation and

02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,480
artifacts this is the important part

02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,040
that i mentioned earlier right so

02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:42,880
even if the license gives you the right

02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:44,880
to use software in any way you want to

02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:46,880
you also have to comply with the

02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:48,079
obligations and that usually means that

02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,599
you have to provide

02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:54,000
accompanying documentation and

02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:55,280
then finally this application also talks

02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,159
about contributions

02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:59,599
um they call it uh community engagement

02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:01,679
so you need to have a certain

02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,840
measurement in place that you

02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:05,520
um that shows that you understand how

02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:08,639
the community works

02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:10,480
so in in short what open chain really

02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:11,520
gives you is a minimum set of

02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:15,360
requirements

02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:20,639
for quality consistency and completeness

02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:23,920
in the open source supply chain

02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:25,040
today uh the open chain project is very

02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:27,520
close to becoming an

02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:29,679
official iso standard so we expect that

02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,440
to be announced later in september or

02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:34,480
october i think

02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:36,639
um before that happens right now

02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:38,480
um there's a self-certification

02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:38,960
questionnaire available that you can

02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:42,000
find

02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:45,119
on the open chain project website

02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:47,199
that helps you as an individual project

02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:48,960
as a company as someone who's just

02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:50,400
interested in learning more about open

02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,440
source compliance

02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:55,119
to work with this specification and it

02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:58,320
works like a survey

02:12:55,119 --> 02:12:58,880
so you can go on the website register

02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,960
yourself

02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:02,800
and then you will be guided through a

02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:04,239
survey that asks you different questions

02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:06,800
and here you can see

02:13:04,239 --> 02:13:08,880
all the different sections of questions

02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,239
that match to the specification that

02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:12,079
i've mentioned earlier

02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:13,360
and once you have answered all the

02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:17,400
questions with yes

02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:19,920
you can you know um and qualify as

02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:21,679
self-certified um against the open chain

02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:23,840
requirements

02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:25,440
before we go to the final slide which

02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,599
basically just gives you the

02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:30,560
um opportunity to ask some questions i

02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:33,280
wanted to close with some general

02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,480
thoughts on compliance from my

02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:37,920
experience

02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:39,360
being responsible for compliance in any

02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:42,840
context

02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:46,480
is a very tough job it's

02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:48,079
usually um basically it's run under the

02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:51,040
radar let me put it like this

02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:51,760
so if everything goes well it's hardly

02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:55,119
noticed

02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:57,920
right because if everything goes well um

02:13:55,119 --> 02:13:59,520
there's nothing to celebrate but if

02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:03,040
things go wrong

02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:05,599
then you know the big fire is uh

02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:07,440
has started and then it's usually the

02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:08,639
compliance officer or someone in charge

02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:11,679
of compliance who gets

02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:13,920
all the the the blaming for that

02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:15,840
so being responsible for compliance is a

02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:16,719
tricky beast i would say these people

02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:19,760
really deserve

02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:22,159
our attention and our support in general

02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:24,000
i would say compliance is not an option

02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:26,079
anymore it's a necessity

02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,840
and that's especially true for the open

02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:29,760
source ecosystem

02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:33,360
compliance gives you a competitive

02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:36,079
advantage especially on the context of

02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:38,000
corporations because it saves you time

02:14:36,079 --> 02:14:41,040
and resources once you have

02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:44,079
the compliance process set up properly

02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:45,199
and then compliance nowadays is also a

02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:47,599
key requirement

02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:49,920
for um most of the software vendors if

02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:52,800
not all software vendors right so

02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:53,440
who would buy software or you know

02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,760
receive

02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:57,840
software including open source uh

02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:58,639
components from a vendor who is not

02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:00,400
compliant

02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:01,679
then that basically means that you have

02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:04,079
to do all the

02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,280
analysis and the compliance work in in

02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:07,360
the company

02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:09,599
and finally i would say compliance is a

02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:11,599
key requirement for the entire open

02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:13,280
source ecosystem so if we

02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:15,440
as part of the ecosystem don't

02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:16,880
understand the license details and the

02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,960
obligations and

02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:20,320
are not in a position to handle them

02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:23,199
appropriately

02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:24,719
then i think the whole system is um

02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:27,199
basically

02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:27,840
yeah at risk and that's where i want to

02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:30,880
um

02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:33,280
close and hopefully we have some um

02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:35,119
some minutes for questions left and if

02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:37,679
there are any questions later on

02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:39,920
feel free to reach me at this email

02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:41,840
address thank you very much

02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:43,119
thank you it looks like we have a

02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:45,520
question coming in so

02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:47,840
i will wait for that to finish typing

02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,840
out

02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:51,840
um

02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:59,360
okay so first question

02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:00,880
is what are your thoughts on running

02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:04,239
libreoffice software

02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:06,719
in non-libre office library operating

02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,719
systems

02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:12,560
oh yeah that's a that's a tricky one

02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:16,159
right so i usually use

02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:17,599
i i'm i'm not happy to um offer that but

02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:19,440
working with different clients

02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:21,360
i'm forced to work with most of the

02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:23,520
proprietary stuff as well

02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:24,800
in order to be compatible and exchange

02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:27,520
data

02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:29,760
so only on my private time i run

02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:31,920
libreoffice and these kind of

02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,280
things so it's very hard to convince

02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:36,399
people to move

02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:39,439
from um proprietary products

02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:41,760
to open source alternatives

02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:43,760
i think that's my that's my thought it's

02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:46,319
very hard and

02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:49,200
i include myself in that so it's a long

02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:49,200
way to go still

02:16:52,319 --> 02:16:56,319
all right well i guess we can go in

02:16:54,319 --> 02:17:00,880
another moment see if anyone has any

02:16:56,319 --> 02:17:02,880
comments or questions coming in

02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:05,280
yeah i have to admit that talking about

02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:09,679
and probably thinking about compliance

02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:09,679
on a sunday evening at eight

02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:16,639
is something that really only very uh

02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:20,399
enthusiastic people probably go into

02:17:16,639 --> 02:17:23,519
it's okay okay so

02:17:20,399 --> 02:17:25,280
the from the first question it was

02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:27,120
uh there is a comment saying sorry was

02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:29,840
not libreoffice but libra

02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,840
software

02:17:30,479 --> 02:17:36,719
so i misspoke on that one okay

02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:39,280
so what's the question then

02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:41,040
something different like you wanted me

02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:43,519
to talk about what

02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,639
free and open source and libra software

02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:49,439
and the differences

02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:50,800
and all these kind of you know political

02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:52,559
talks going on in the background

02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:57,120
probably not

02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:59,040
so i could say hi hi ikea that's nice

02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,960
okay so we have another question coming

02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:04,559
in

02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:04,559
i'll let them finish typing it out

02:18:08,399 --> 02:18:12,080
and it looks like our second question is

02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:15,040
is compliance

02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:17,280
hard to enforce in educational settings

02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:19,599
such as schools and universities

02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:24,160
any suggestions on regulations that

02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:27,920
would lead to a greater adoption year

02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:31,439
that's a good question so i have seen

02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:34,399
many universities uh really

02:18:31,439 --> 02:18:35,359
trying to be compliant on all sorts of

02:18:34,399 --> 02:18:37,679
levels so

02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:40,240
talk about open source and software and

02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:41,840
especially in the context of open access

02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:45,040
right and content

02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:48,160
so my experience is that universities

02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:52,000
and educational institutions in general

02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:55,599
are really the let me say good guys

02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:58,399
um trying to get everything right

02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:58,880
the only problem that they sometimes

02:18:58,399 --> 02:19:02,080
have

02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:03,840
is that there's not enough expertise so

02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:04,319
what i've done in the past for example

02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,519
is to

02:19:04,319 --> 02:19:09,599
you know just provide pro bono um

02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:10,719
advice here and there on how to get

02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:13,920
things right the bad

02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:15,840
guys in this game are the publishers

02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:17,519
let's put it like that especially in the

02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:20,240
university context when it comes to

02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:23,679
publishing and

02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:26,719
you know not making really relevant

02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:29,920
content and papers available under

02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:31,040
an open access license and some of the

02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,359
corporations

02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,240
that want to basically squeeze out

02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,000
technology

02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:37,439
from university in the technology

02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,160
transfer project

02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:40,639
and then you have to negotiate and argue

02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:44,160
about

02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:46,559
you know open source um licenses

02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:48,319
and and also patents for example how to

02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:49,920
deal with patents in that context of

02:19:48,319 --> 02:19:52,399
technology transfer so

02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,280
my experience is that universities and

02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:56,160
and

02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:58,000
basically the background in education

02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:58,960
they are really trying to get it right

02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,840
and there's a huge

02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:02,319
interest in using open source licenses

02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:04,160
and

02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:05,840
making stuff available and finding

02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:09,520
partners in that context

02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:09,520
but we have to support them

02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:18,399
absolutely well it looks like we

02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:19,280
are out of time and there are no more

02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:21,439
questions coming in

02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,319
but really great positive comments for

02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:24,319

02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:18,080
it's not actually so difficult maybe i

02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:21,359
don't know accurately because

02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:22,960
to me it's natural of course but exactly

02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:24,720
it's possible to take another language

02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:26,160
mind is not perfect the way i take the

02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:31,359
english but i'm taking

02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:42,960
is model and for this point

02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:46,000
after why i do that and um

02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:47,280
so when they asked me to arrange this

02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,960
meeting they asked me to

02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:51,040
talk about what scheduling life is where

02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:54,720
it comes from how it is

02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:55,200
that he has 200 000 um downloading for

02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:58,479
one

02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:01,359
reason for it

02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:02,479
so uh i was uh checking with live stuff

02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:03,920
like that and certainly

02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:06,560
but i have to talk about the video

02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:10,720
editor so what's the best with it

02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:21,840
is doing what a video that i showed you

02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:21,840
now if i can control it

02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:29,720
[Music]

02:26:29,090 --> 02:26:32,870
[Applause]

02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:32,870
[Music]

02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:37,920
which aims to deliver a free and open

02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:40,080
video editing software application

02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:42,000
to allow everybody to produce quality

02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:45,520
content in order in order to increase

02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:47,840
the democratization of the media

02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:48,560
the application is a graphic interface

02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:51,600
written in c

02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:54,319
plus plus with qt and kde libraries for

02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:57,280
the mlt framework written by dandenity

02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:59,200
which relies on ffmpeg to decode and

02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:00,800
encode almost all the video and audio

02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:02,560
formats that are out today

02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:04,319
and which host effects libraries like

02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:07,439
freyor and move it for video

02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:09,200
and last spot and socks for audio by

02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:10,399
following the official documents that we

02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:12,240
can find on the internet

02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:14,880
the project was launched by jason wood

02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:18,240
who released version 0.2.3

02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:18,240
in october 2003

02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:25,200
soon katie and live 0.2.4 followed

02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:26,640
but the community did not yet exist and

02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:30,160
the group was very small

02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:32,800
the project stopped for two years

02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:33,439
before the end of 2005 john baptiste

02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,800
mardell

02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:36,560
who heard that the project would be

02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:39,040
reactivated offered his help

02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:39,760
and in 2006 he signed the post of the

02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,800
new release

02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:44,640
0.3 of the program from this moment on

02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:47,200
he became the main reference point for

02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:47,200
the project

02:27:48,319 --> 02:27:53,680
version 0.4 and 0.5 are soon distributed

02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:55,600
but there is an issue a refactoring of

02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:57,920
the code is needed to go forward

02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:59,920
the program has to be moved from kde 3

02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:03,040
which is not compatible with mlt

02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:04,880
to kde 4. the rewriting ends in 2008

02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:07,920
followed by several new releases

02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:09,760
but in 2011 a further migration from kde

02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:13,840
4 to kde 5 was needed

02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:13,840
to allow the program to grow

02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,080
in 2012 a crowdfunding campaign is

02:28:16,399 --> 02:28:20,560
launched to fund the operation

02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:21,359
and before the end of 2014 the goal is

02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:24,800
reached

02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:25,840
then finally in 2015 kdenlive becomes an

02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:28,720
official kde

02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:29,280
application john baptiste was invited to

02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:32,319
academy

02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:33,760
to present 10 years of activity

02:28:32,319 --> 02:28:34,860
the new perspective is to make the

02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:36,399
project even bigger

02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:38,080
[Music]

02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:39,920
before the end of the year the first

02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:42,000
canadian live cafe is announced with the

02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:43,600
aim of getting more people involved

02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,359
during this virtual meeting it

02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:46,080
immediately became clear that in order

02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:47,200
to grow

02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:49,760
kitty and live needed to be

02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:50,319
cross-platform the windows version was

02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:52,800
announced

02:28:50,319 --> 02:28:54,080
and 2016 began with a sprint meeting

02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,160
followed by the new logo

02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:57,920
and the new site but as soon as the

02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:59,600
development of new features started

02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:01,359
it was evident that the code for the

02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:03,840
timeline had to be rewritten

02:29:01,359 --> 02:29:05,439
because it was too old and no longer fit

02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:07,280
everybody knew that the refactoring

02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:08,640
could take several months or years

02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:11,040
but the community did not lose

02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:14,080
enthusiasm

02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:15,280
in 2018 a new roadmap was written and in

02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:17,520
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:19,040
the refactored code was distributed

02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,319
although some fine tuning was still

02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:22,000
needed

02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:23,680
to overcome this the focus of the

02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,600
community in 2020

02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:27,840
has revolved around fixing and improving

02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:28,680
the program the result of this is the

02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,760
latest version

02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:32,479
20.08 which delivers stability several

02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:37,290
new features

02:29:32,479 --> 02:29:38,860
and a new interface with five workspaces

02:29:37,290 --> 02:29:43,280
[Applause]

02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:45,680
[Music]

02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:46,399
okay so this is the video i want to

02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:48,720
present

02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:50,000
you so i guess that is now i have

02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:52,720
nothing more to say about

02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,200
the predator the software i want to show

02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:56,080
you

02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:56,960
the software itself it's where the

02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:00,080
moment

02:29:56,960 --> 02:30:04,000
is duck

02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:06,080
okay allow so i'm in the circle i would

02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,560
like to check if you see the same stuff

02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:10,880
i'm just

02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:13,920
watching okay this is the project

02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:15,200
we i realized to show you the video we

02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:17,600
just

02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:19,040
as you can see it's pretty easy we have

02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:21,200
our been arranged but we

02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:22,960
start from i want to show you but the

02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,960
application this was my intent

02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:26,800
actually to show you a little bit

02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:28,240
application when i'm waiting for

02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:30,800
questions etc so we

02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:32,880
start a new project and we try to show

02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:35,920
you this fantastic five workspace

02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:38,160
we speaking about at the end of the

02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:39,200
video i thank you sean ranci for the

02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:41,680
fantastic voice

02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:43,280
he put on the video so this is a you can

02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:46,800
see in this corner up

02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:50,640
corner on the left right we set these

02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:53,439
um these workspace

02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:54,720
that are usable for the different step

02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:58,000
of the

02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:58,640
work you can of course change there you

02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,600
can

02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:02,399
overwrite or save the layout i can see

02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:05,439
and you create

02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:07,040
also new slot and reset what is the

02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:10,000
default set

02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:12,560
so we choose to use this kind of space

02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:15,760
for some reason for example the login

02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:18,960
i hope i'm not going too far

02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:21,280
your camera microphone and big oh

02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:24,560
shared okay yes it's just an announcer

02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:27,040
check my situation because okay

02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:27,920
i go back on the program so um this is

02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:30,720
the bean

02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:32,080
i am informing you that the interface is

02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:35,120
actually made by

02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:37,439
um by widget

02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:38,319
so this is the list of the widget we can

02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:39,840
have the bar

02:31:38,319 --> 02:31:41,680
so as you can see there are actually

02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:43,840
window we can move

02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:44,880
vertically horizontally i remove this

02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:46,720
and so

02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:48,240
actually the widgets of this object

02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:51,120
appears in a different

02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:51,920
situation in different positions for the

02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:54,880
reason i

02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:55,439
want to explain itself so in the to

02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:57,280
ingest

02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:59,280
our material in the bin we have

02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:01,600
different ways with for example we can

02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:04,240
open from here we can right click on the

02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:07,520
b in here we can we can even

02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:10,240
import thing for example dragging

02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:11,520
straight from you asked me to switch a

02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:14,240
project because it's

02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:14,880
interlaced materials it's correct to do

02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:17,600
um

02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:19,520
or in if you are in advanced uh for

02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:22,160
example anything we can even drop a

02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:23,200
i show you after drop straight away in

02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:25,040
the timeline and

02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,640
the the clip is added to the project

02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:29,120
automatically

02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:30,319
what is interesting here we have for

02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:33,439
example here

02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:37,200
um a clip with two different

02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:39,040
audio streams one is you can see the

02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:40,880
environment having monophonic the other

02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,840
was the microphone there was turned off

02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:43,920
at the moment

02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:45,439
what's interesting in a new for example

02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:47,920
feature about the

02:32:45,439 --> 02:32:48,720
the waveform is that you can see when

02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:50,800
you go here

02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:52,479
you can even scrub the audio you can

02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:54,720
even with controller or

02:32:52,479 --> 02:32:56,080
mouse roll you can even go in this is

02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:58,000
maybe not the best clip

02:32:56,080 --> 02:33:00,160
to show because it's not so long enough

02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:02,399
after when we talk about audio

02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:03,760
i'll show you better anyway in the video

02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:05,760
clip we have the

02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:07,120
the audi visualization with if with the

02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:09,680
clip is more

02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:11,600
audio we can in the properties select

02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:14,160
without you want to use

02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:15,359
or merge the two together we have the

02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:18,319
same

02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:20,000
um option here and i remind you that the

02:33:18,319 --> 02:33:22,240
recently getting live has a chance to

02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:25,120
drive adjust the video the audio on

02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:26,479
the timeline while i show you this later

02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:28,399
but interesting here that

02:33:26,479 --> 02:33:29,920
for example if we have a specific

02:33:28,399 --> 02:33:32,800
indication this movie is not

02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:34,399
the most interesting feature maybe

02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:35,680
someone is talking and i ingest

02:33:34,399 --> 02:33:37,840
something else

02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:39,520
we have a reference point here we can

02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:44,479
add for example a market

02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:44,479
put a note for example interesting stuff

02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:48,479
at this point when we need to go back in

02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:50,640
this point in the clip

02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:52,880
if we are just to click on the point and

02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:53,760
ever because of course we can we go back

02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:56,319
in the part

02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:58,240
we can of course add remove etc in the

02:33:56,319 --> 02:34:00,479
second space

02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:01,439
we have i can ingest more we can go back

02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:03,920
and we ingest

02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:04,880
more for example i prepare a folder with

02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:07,520
some stuff

02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:09,680
with just this six audio so six three

02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:13,439
mile just some audio

02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:15,359
uh this is pretty heavy so i don't know

02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:16,800
we have to wait okay ingest everything

02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:19,760
and when i waiting

02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:21,600
that the machine do that i stay back in

02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:23,680
camera because they told me that

02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:25,439
this light could be if everything is

02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:28,080
working i have no feedback

02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:28,960
it's okay now when everything is ready

02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:30,960
okay

02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:32,399
um i wait a little bit of time because

02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:35,439
here there is some also 4k

02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:41,359
footage that uh person helped me

02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:41,359
to do um okay i go back to the editing

02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:46,399
i can show you some interesting stuff

02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:48,160
for example for example about the audio

02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:51,200
in the monitor we have just not

02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:53,520
improved i can show you with other for

02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:57,600
example this one is

02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:58,000
that we have the audio as i show you it

02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:00,720
is

02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,200
easier to understand what i mean before

02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:03,040
now

02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:04,399
i go to every audio clip this is

02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:07,280
actually the music for example

02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:10,800
i used i used for the clip what is

02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:12,399
interesting now we can scrub the audio

02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:14,319
we can scrap the audio we have this

02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:16,560
ruler this rule is in live

02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:18,160
because we want to drag and drop people

02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:21,040
we can handle the clip

02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:24,000
from the space like you can see but if

02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:27,280
we want we want to scroll we can scroll

02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,000
all with the control uh roll up raw we

02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:32,240
can also

02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:35,010
navigate the audio and then

02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:38,080
if we play of course or if we play

02:35:35,010 --> 02:35:40,160
[Music]

02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:41,680
the waveform follow us what is

02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:44,000
interesting about

02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:45,200
i'm not editing anything about it for

02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,240
example i'll show you

02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:51,359
like bring sign

02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:54,080
some footage that has six out of six

02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:56,080
eight of the stream sorry this is eight

02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:57,520
audio stream is because the camera is

02:35:56,080 --> 02:36:01,439
doing this way

02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:03,680
and i can show you the properties

02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:04,800
so this is a for example because camera

02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:07,120
that use

02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:09,200
two channels for any proposal but for

02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:12,319
example we can see that we have three

02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:14,640
full channel e3 empty channels so we

02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:17,520
can for example deselect the channel we

02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:17,520
don't need

02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:20,800
at this point for example we drag now i

02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:23,680
prefer to

02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:24,080
throw the audio we can draft drag that

02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:27,840
to

02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:30,960
audio just we want

02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:31,840
if someone inside is a three point edit

02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:34,560
i would i would

02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:34,880
do that here that i remind you that this

02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:37,840
is

02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:40,000
the source of all so it is listed what

02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:41,600
we have one video source in this case

02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,760
two audio source because it's one we

02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:45,439
selected but if you want more track

02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:48,240
we're much better and more are you

02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:50,720
selected with all the sources

02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:53,120
for example we implement this stuff that

02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:56,080
allow you to just allow us to select

02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:57,520
the audio that is the track so when we

02:36:56,080 --> 02:37:00,479
decide for example

02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:02,000
to put the audio sorry to don't put

02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:05,520
audio here for example

02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:09,439
but put just here with

02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:12,479
so we can select where things go

02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:13,520
then to be simple this is the out

02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:16,640
improvement that

02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:18,560
it's actually it's uh allow us to select

02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:19,760
the stream we want it was a feature that

02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:23,280
people ask about

02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:25,680
if we are in the audio modality next

02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:26,319
i want to show you we have this mixer

02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,720
but if

02:37:26,319 --> 02:37:29,840
we for example the number of tracks just

02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:32,960
to show you

02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:34,430
what happened if i for example

02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:36,160
insert

02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:39,200
[Music]

02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:42,720
six five all your tracks

02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:43,760
this our mixer is uh grow with the

02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:46,560
tracks we need

02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,880
in the mixer we have the way to call the

02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:50,000
as

02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:51,359
here the filter for the track if you

02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,560
want to oh sorry

02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:57,600
if you want to insert

02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:59,120
some audio filter for example here we

02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:02,160
have just for example to

02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:03,120
drag and drop on the clip and we can add

02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:06,240
here of course

02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:07,359
the volume can be applied also to the

02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,840
track

02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:11,200
and so we have also keyframe for the

02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,000
track

02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:14,800
in this way we have a video monitor for

02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,240
our

02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:19,359
and so we have also um this is not super

02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:21,760
volume audio but

02:38:19,359 --> 02:38:23,520
in the in case that we have i take

02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:26,240
something

02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:26,720
more interesting in my voice speaking

02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:30,479
that

02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:34,560
we have before i don't find it anymore

02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:39,120
here so we have

02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:39,120
for example the representation here not

02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:43,840
working

02:38:48,399 --> 02:38:54,479
enough i put the music probably so

02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:56,319
but it's supposed to work regularly

02:38:54,479 --> 02:38:59,600
because it's always worked

02:38:56,319 --> 02:39:02,240
we have a monitor in this moment

02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,880
this is maybe a true this is not the

02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:05,680
best

02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:06,880
doing live anyway next step is the

02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:09,280
effect

02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:10,960
that allow us for example if you want to

02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:14,800
call or

02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:18,240
a clip we can use for example we are in

02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:19,920
video filter here for example transform

02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:23,120
you can use that also we can

02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:25,280
have on the right click from here so

02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:25,680
when we use the transform we have a very

02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,080
big

02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:29,520
panel with our keyframes here for

02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:33,200
example we can

02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:35,920
use to stop like rotating a clip

02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:36,640
so we see that from point to point we

02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:39,680
rotate

02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:40,640
oh okay we rotate the clip from point to

02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:43,520
point

02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,520
as you suppose

02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:51,600
there are space if the color space

02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:54,160
that allows us to this for example the i

02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:55,359
want this moment this moment as a audio

02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:58,080
clip but actually

02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:59,520
the idea to put this here is for example

02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:01,920
we have to match

02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:03,520
two different scene this could be used

02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:06,160
as a reference monitor because

02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:07,280
tell us which is the imaging we have to

02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:10,399
match

02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:13,040
if the clip for example is already

02:40:10,399 --> 02:40:14,240
on the timeline and is treated with some

02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:16,479
filters

02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:18,720
we can i remember you that we can select

02:40:16,479 --> 02:40:21,200
the clip with the filters if we need the

02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:24,240
create with the library

02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:27,200
um copyright

02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:28,080
test to make a color correction then we

02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:31,760
can

02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:35,600
add the test to our bean and

02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:37,760
then one is in the in the project we can

02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:39,520
use i hope is the correct clip because i

02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:42,560
do a test before

02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:46,000
and so maybe i rename with the same name

02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:48,319
and so so this is what i want to say

02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,200
about the workspace coming back so i

02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:52,720
have to close

02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:57,040
here okay

02:40:52,720 --> 02:41:00,560
now this is what it is i have to

02:40:57,040 --> 02:41:03,840
load back so my

02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:03,840
video something

02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:15,279
and sorry for inter so interruption

02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:17,600
um what i want to say that this is the

02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:19,279
explanation of the new stuff in canadian

02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:20,800
live i showed you the mixer i show you

02:41:19,279 --> 02:41:21,600
the fact that we have the monitor or the

02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:23,439
audio on the

02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:26,160
way without the the workspace that

02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:28,640
arranged that to authorize a better

02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:30,800
workflow and a lot of new stuff i'll

02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:32,560
show you the project when i created this

02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:33,840
video so to show you that it's possible

02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:35,439
to create professional video with the

02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:36,160
tool because it's very advanced at this

02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:39,200
point

02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:41,120
someone asked me about what is the

02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:42,960
the future of the of the problem the

02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:45,040
future of the programming we have a very

02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:46,720
interesting roadmap for example we are

02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:49,200
developing this moment

02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:49,920
the same track transition that is to

02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:52,560
save so

02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:54,399
space on the track run we need to fade

02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,840
the crossfade although the transition

02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:57,760
between clip

02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:59,279
in the plan there is also an improved

02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:00,960
nesting for the future with

02:41:59,279 --> 02:42:03,279
multiple timelines it will be possible

02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:05,279
as soon as possible and the advancing

02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:06,080
trimming tools then probably we try to

02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:08,080
finish

02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:10,160
the audio that we already in going

02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:12,319
directional multi-channels also

02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:13,359
routing and mapping of the channels in

02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:16,560
the future to make

02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:17,600
complete the out environment and after

02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:20,000
that i guess that

02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:21,279
we go deep in the filters of secondary

02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,760
correction and reset

02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:25,840
and readjust the of the filter

02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:28,080
incorporate probably also isn't a road

02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:29,120
map is possible some ai tool like frame

02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:32,319
boosting like

02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:33,439
uh super resolution maybe speech to tax

02:42:32,319 --> 02:42:35,840
and what else

02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:37,200
on the long long future that this is on

02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:38,960
the short future because with these

02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:40,880
three tools i told you we probably

02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:44,880
reached the state of the main

02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:47,920
main um we can find in the industry

02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:49,840
then in the future maybe also we can see

02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:54,000
also there is a guy before

02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:56,160
sorry for they talk about incorporate

02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,600
kda in android maybe a mobile

02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:58,479
application maybe a server application

02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:01,680
maybe introduce

02:42:58,479 --> 02:43:03,600
vr360 or stereoscopy we'll see but now

02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:04,479
we have the urgency to reach a level to

02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:07,279
move from

02:43:04,479 --> 02:43:08,640
we are already to me adapt for youtubers

02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:11,520
maybe to evolve to

02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:12,240
even better you know needs to mean for

02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:14,160
example

02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:16,000
next step to me is television production

02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:17,680
for example because uh

02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:19,200
it need to be very reliable and very

02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:23,040
fast the software

02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:26,319
and the we are to me we are almost there

02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:27,600
uh to say about the other software

02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:29,359
actually the competitor means

02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:30,640
that not competitor the the software

02:43:29,359 --> 02:43:33,120
they ask money

02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:34,000
and their property they are not too far

02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:36,319
in my opinion

02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:38,399
and they have not new implementation

02:43:36,319 --> 02:43:41,200
except they are checking just to ai

02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:42,240
to make automatic editing that for the

02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:44,960
moment google and

02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:46,880
adobe mostly are pretty still pretty

02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:49,920
amatorial stuff is not

02:43:46,880 --> 02:43:52,319
not so promising promising and we'll see

02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:53,840
what happens the steps so is short to me

02:43:52,319 --> 02:43:55,920
to reach

02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:56,960
to be there to be totally professional

02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:59,840
so i really

02:43:56,960 --> 02:44:00,880
believe that we are on the right way and

02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:04,399
what i can say about

02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:05,040
the open source in general open source

02:44:04,399 --> 02:44:06,800
uh

02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:08,240
software in the in the industry of the

02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:09,680
media i must say that there are

02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:10,479
interesting very interesting projects

02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:12,000
that

02:44:10,479 --> 02:44:13,279
some in national television already

02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,720
incorporate for example norway

02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:16,000
television or religion television and

02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:18,720
sweden television

02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:19,760
as a workforce completely for uh talk

02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:22,240
shows news and

02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:23,200
broadcasting now mostly of information

02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:25,600
based on uh

02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:27,359
open software the win in the center is

02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:29,600
frequently mlt

02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:30,479
by kidney lab you know it's better and

02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:33,040
on the video

02:44:30,479 --> 02:44:33,600
and um and they see for example in

02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:36,560
norway

02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:37,200
and sweden television they have all

02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:40,319
complete

02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:42,160
line of workflow on open software except

02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:44,319
for the video editor so we

02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:46,479
aim to go there as soon as possible to

02:44:44,319 --> 02:44:47,600
become the video it is a reference for

02:44:46,479 --> 02:44:49,359
these

02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:51,520
people that choose already open software

02:44:49,359 --> 02:44:54,880
to implement their own

02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:56,080
their own services so if you i guess i

02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:58,479
don't know i'm

02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:59,520
always so fast and if i consume all the

02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:01,279
time so i

02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:03,680
if it's there is sometimes i'm ready for

02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:05,840
a question i'll listen next to that

02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:05,840
yep

02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:11,680
okay it was i was too short too long

02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:14,800
towards too much

02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:17,760
it was okay perfect thank you

02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:19,200
okay i'm gonna be progressing if not

02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:21,920
questions

02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:23,680
no you're on perfect time so let's get

02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:27,120
going with the first question you have

02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:31,200
five oh good all right

02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:35,200
first one what is your perspective on

02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:38,080
titling and title transitions

02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:39,680
in editor has come a long way in the

02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:43,040
past few years

02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:46,319
but it seems preferable to import

02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:49,279
titles as svgs

02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:49,600
are there any discussions on advancing

02:45:49,279 --> 02:45:52,319
how

02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:53,120
caden live handles these titles okay

02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:57,840
there is a

02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:57,840
national attack so i know

02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:02,720
thank you for the question and you know

02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:05,760
this makes a big awkward actually

02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:09,359
because there is a conversation uh

02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:11,840
to me the title has to be a very um

02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:13,920
compositing compositional static object

02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:16,000
that you animate in timeline to be

02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:18,479
about the music on the all the time like

02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:21,040
i do already i animate all the time and

02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:23,120
ever actually i start with slides so i

02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:26,479
put the object like to check the story

02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:28,240
then i choose the music after so anyway

02:46:26,479 --> 02:46:29,760
the synchronization between the sound

02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:32,080
for example

02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:34,800
i i use the title for example the role

02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:37,520
that comes up in front inside of fm peg

02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:38,160
i make a roller crawl title on the title

02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:40,960
then i

02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:43,120
with the with dropping i cut the bottom

02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:43,680
actually scroll naturally in position

02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:45,760
inside it

02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:47,840
the title they probably found that for

02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:48,399
example i prefer another software when

02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:50,160
you

02:46:48,399 --> 02:46:52,160
when your animation you extend the time

02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:53,359
of the title animation fit exactly

02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:55,040
for example you have a crawler three

02:46:53,359 --> 02:46:56,000
seconds but you need five seconds

02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:58,479
extended the crawl

02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,680
automatically adapt to the side and the

02:46:58,479 --> 02:47:01,520
an animation inside

02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:02,880
the title there sometimes create problem

02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:05,680
to adapt into my opinion

02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:06,160
but zipper now is done the title we have

02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:08,080
now

02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:10,479
is a little bit rigid you missed some

02:47:08,080 --> 02:47:13,439
undo some features that are important

02:47:10,479 --> 02:47:14,160
and to align the text is no bad in my

02:47:13,439 --> 02:47:16,160
opinion

02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:18,399
it creates problem because for example i

02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:21,920
use the title created with that with

02:47:18,399 --> 02:47:23,520
a composition to change to deform it and

02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:25,920
then use another way

02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:27,520
and they render me green so the title

02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:29,920
has has to be

02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:33,760
refined absolutely but to me is not the

02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:36,240
biggest problem in the moment so i guess

02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:38,319
anyway we have a project a kill that

02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:39,040
entered to work on uh i guess it was

02:47:38,319 --> 02:47:40,800
opengl

02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:42,640
to make an animation software and not

02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:43,840
against the animation title because

02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:47,120
animated title can

02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:48,000
import um preset the other people

02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:50,640
community can create

02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:52,160
so we can an animation to share also 3d

02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:54,960
it's maybe a simple uh

02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:56,399
default setup to have but we've seen the

02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:58,479
time achilles actually

02:47:56,399 --> 02:47:59,520
say goodbye because it has to go i know

02:47:58,479 --> 02:48:02,160
that is

02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:04,080
it's important for him i let a lot of

02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:05,040
job if someone will collect a deal a

02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:06,800
legacy

02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:08,800
we can go forward the sooner with the

02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:10,080
title if possible the community is a

02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:13,359
secret so more we are

02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:15,760
better we can do faster as possible

02:48:13,359 --> 02:48:17,359
absolutely okay all right shall we move

02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:20,240
to the next question

02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:21,439
sure of course all right it says do you

02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:24,800
have statistics

02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:26,880
on the number of installs okay

02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:28,160
i i'm not the one who checked this stuff

02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:31,359
with oregon

02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:33,760
that give also the number two thousand

02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:34,560
hundred two hundred thousand come from a

02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:36,160
chart in the

02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:37,920
in the group that they communicate the

02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:42,720
numbers so i refer to that

02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:46,160
it's not even uh it's a from 16

02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:49,200
april to 16 august so what there is uh

02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:50,399
2004 was but i know that linux is the

02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:52,000
minority still

02:48:50,399 --> 02:48:54,319
and the fact that the community have

02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:56,160
this number because we are

02:48:54,319 --> 02:48:57,600
windows absolutely now windows services

02:48:56,160 --> 02:49:00,080
start to be stable

02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:01,439
i was very favorable i don't use windows

02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:04,240
absolutely

02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:04,960
but the fact i moved to linux probably

02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:06,880
more than five

02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:08,240
six years or completely except for the

02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:10,560
editing that

02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:11,520
on on the spot when i have to produce

02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:13,520
very fast i

02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:15,600
need to for the moment to be super

02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:16,160
edible kidney lab is the next step i

02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:18,319
guess in

02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:19,840
during the next 12 months we will go

02:49:18,319 --> 02:49:21,520
forward this way i will adopt in

02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:24,000
reproduction for

02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:26,560
for television on the spot that means

02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,399
fast available stable and

02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:30,640
and because sometimes you have to edit

02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:32,800
really a piece of news in 30 minutes

02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:34,640
so two minutes and a half of the finish

02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:38,000
that they broadcast for maybe

02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:39,840
a main television like ryan italy or

02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,520
switzerland television german television

02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:44,640
french television so

02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:45,600
this is the so i will do i will do soon

02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:48,640
so this is what

02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:50,880
uh it's my next to test it and so

02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:52,800
when it will be ready for real i want to

02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:54,720
spread the more possible

02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:56,000
because this is the goal the goal of the

02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:58,960
open source is to

02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:00,960
spread and enter everywhere is possible

02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:02,800
so this is the idea uh

02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:04,399
this is the statistic i don't know i

02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:07,680
know that 20 20

02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:10,240
000 i guess is uh linux and 180

02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:12,560
000 in the windows uh download i hope

02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:14,800
that we go cross platform soon with

02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:16,319
mac os because they can make a

02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:20,160
difference in spreading because

02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:24,000
windows in big companies mostly but

02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:24,399
apple is loved by by people that have a

02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,680
big

02:50:24,399 --> 02:50:28,160
company so professionals uh people like

02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:30,240
that

02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:32,399
sorry if i extended give me the time

02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:35,359
because i'm invading

02:50:32,399 --> 02:50:37,120
so we are on the last minute yeah you

02:50:35,359 --> 02:50:40,240
can squeeze in one last question

02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:42,880
and the last two that are there you can

02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:44,720
take a look in the shower okay i read it

02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:46,319
i i think if you make a sentence to

02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:47,200
answer to everybody in one video do you

02:50:46,319 --> 02:50:49,439
think there's a

02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:51,760
testicular professional video editor is

02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:53,120
so that me okay these are the reasons so

02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:55,040
i'm ready to use it

02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:56,640
as soon as possible and impossible to

02:50:55,040 --> 02:51:00,399
allow integrated with remote

02:50:56,640 --> 02:51:02,479
cloud the idea to make a server version

02:51:00,399 --> 02:51:04,240
could be in the spot actually exactly in

02:51:02,479 --> 02:51:05,680
my notes there is already some 100

02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:07,680
making actually project like that

02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:09,439
because severing could be very

02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:10,800
interesting when you work on mostly in

02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:11,279
the information so when you're in the

02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:13,359
spot

02:51:11,279 --> 02:51:15,760
you can ingest from the spot and people

02:51:13,359 --> 02:51:17,279
from the side also for remote working

02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:19,520
in editing this is very interesting

02:51:17,279 --> 02:51:22,000
topic actually uh

02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:23,439
oh yeah sorry remote clothing is i don't

02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,960
know about ai service i don't know i

02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:27,279
know we have to see

02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:29,680
maybe my opinion is better to integrate

02:51:27,279 --> 02:51:31,920
already model exists already calculated

02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:32,720
to let the filter works on the local

02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:35,920
machine for

02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:38,160
this my mostly my orientation

02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:40,160
what about the coupling the render from

02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:41,920
the application so we can never render

02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:46,160
from from video rendering

02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:48,479
locally of 10 tiles a processor

02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:50,560
this is more technical aspect a farm

02:51:48,479 --> 02:51:52,560
rendering i guess is possible to

02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:56,399
implement

02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:56,960
but i don't know if he's on the list

02:51:56,399 --> 02:51:59,600
actually

02:51:56,960 --> 02:52:00,399
could be interesting but i is this is

02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:02,720
mostly for

02:52:00,399 --> 02:52:04,640
main main rendering so maybe if you make

02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:07,120
big animation because actually

02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:09,040
to normal job uh i didn't have some

02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:10,560
problem with rendering so to produce for

02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:12,640
example three minutes enough

02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:14,720
to pure graphic animation means creature

02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:17,680
i have no

02:52:14,720 --> 02:52:19,200
i spend writing and taking all of the

02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:20,720
assets and everything i spend less than

02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:23,200
two days so it's possible to

02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:24,160
you and i i use the preview rendering

02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:26,399
that is sometimes

02:52:24,160 --> 02:52:27,920
is lost to the rendering i finish last

02:52:26,399 --> 02:52:30,560
question out of the future you think is

02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:32,720
essential but currently

02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:35,040
the the roadmap is already set to based

02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:36,880
on periodic to me now priority is a

02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:38,640
single threat transition to renew the

02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:42,479
space and boosting the

02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:44,880
the the performances and then

02:52:42,479 --> 02:52:46,240
have a multiple timeline that is change

02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:47,840
completely to me the aspect of the

02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:50,880
program for motivation

02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:51,600
that's all i i'm sorry i invaded the

02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:56,800
space

02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:56,800
i don't know i hope you enjoyed

02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:06,720
thank you for inviting me and thank you

02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:10,160
everybody bye

02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:13,439
bye bye all right everyone

02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:25,840
and he will be up in just a moment

02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:05,120
so while we are getting set up for

02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:06,080
benjamin he should be uploading his

02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:09,439
slides there we

02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:11,520
go perfect okay well

02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:12,880
before i introduce benjamin i would like

02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:14,800
to say that

02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:16,720
this is going to be the last talk

02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:19,520
session in this room for today

02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:20,800
um after this please head over if you'd

02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:23,680
like to room 1

02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:26,960
where our second keynote speaker naruti

02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:26,960
sanchez will be speaking

02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:34,640

02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:37,840
thank you no i'm great

02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:40,399
so everything seems to work

02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:50,319
um so if you'd like to get started we

02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:52,080

02:54:50,319 --> 02:54:53,760
everyone please give a big round of

02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:56,240
applause and a warm warm welcome for

02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:56,240
benjamin

02:54:56,479 --> 02:55:00,160
okay so today we will speak about system

02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,720
settings

02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:04,000
so i'm binge i'm import i'm from any

02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:08,160
occult odd culture

02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:10,800
a french development company

02:55:08,160 --> 02:55:12,640
that sponsors my time to to write the

02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:17,840
slides that's why i use

02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:17,840
this step so let's start

02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:23,760
are you smoking so the

02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:24,479
why we need system settings as you know

02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:26,800
plasma

02:55:24,479 --> 02:55:28,800
is a powerful environment and there is

02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:32,319
lots of configuration

02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:35,520
and so we need to let the user

02:55:32,319 --> 02:55:37,359
have a way to configure them that's why

02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:40,160
we have the system settings system

02:55:37,359 --> 02:55:43,680
settings is composed of

02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:46,319
many many modules

02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:47,120
for plasma for example the time is for

02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:50,240
plasma but

02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:53,520
also for other stuff like sound

02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:56,160
with pulse audio or display

02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:58,319
or phones and everything everything it's

02:55:56,160 --> 02:56:00,640
a module on the system settings

02:55:58,319 --> 02:56:03,359
so i guess everyone know what is system

02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:03,359
setting but

02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:12,560
so what are modules in a lower levels on

02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:15,279
a screenshot

02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:16,319
so modules are queue widget or cute

02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:18,720
quick buzz

02:56:16,319 --> 02:56:19,680
uh in the future there will be all cure

02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:23,840
quick ways

02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:24,880
uh it's a goal for for kd framework six

02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:28,560
to

02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:32,000
two don't have uh curate modules anymore

02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:34,080
so mostly of them are based on on the

02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:35,840
config framework it's a configuration

02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:38,960
framework i will tell you more

02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:40,720
about that in the next slides and there

02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:41,279
is also some other configuration

02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:44,080
frameworks

02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:45,040
used there two settings check off and

02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:49,439
yeah some more

02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:53,200
some other some other for some modules

02:56:49,439 --> 02:56:56,720
but when we

02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:58,880
we were like one uh one year ago

02:56:56,720 --> 02:57:00,880
some stuff were broken for example we

02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:01,680
don't have the apply reset and default

02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:05,120
button

02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:08,000
work as expected on all of the modules

02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:10,240
lots of times the state was not the one

02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,720
expected

02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:13,279
and in many cases the visual feedback

02:57:12,720 --> 02:57:16,319
for the

02:57:13,279 --> 02:57:18,160
imitable entry was broken i will tell

02:57:16,319 --> 02:57:19,040
more about imitable entry in the next

02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:21,760
slide too

02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:22,399
but basically we need to disable a

02:57:21,760 --> 02:57:25,279
widget

02:57:22,399 --> 02:57:25,840
if it's in table and that didn't work at

02:57:25,279 --> 02:57:28,479
all for

02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:28,479
all modules

02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:41,359
so i will tell you a bit about uh

02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:44,640
config and kiosk so like i said

02:57:41,359 --> 02:57:48,000
config is a framework for configuration

02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:50,080
it subtracts the way we store data

02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:52,160
for configuration on the disk it's a

02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:56,560
kind of any file with

02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:59,760
some specific stuff and that allows

02:57:56,560 --> 02:58:02,240
cascading what that means is we can have

02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:04,880
a configuration our chooser model but we

02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:08,080
can also of configuration

02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:11,040
a system level and if there

02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:12,080
is configuration at user level it will

02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:15,120
be

02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:17,200
took and if not we will use

02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:18,160
the one at system level and if there is

02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:20,560
no configuration

02:58:18,160 --> 02:58:22,640
for this item at all we will take the

02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:23,840
one from the code

02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:26,319
[Music]

02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:27,200
it's what do conflict basically really

02:58:26,319 --> 02:58:30,880
basically

02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:33,760
um kiosk is

02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:35,680
from also based on configs that allow

02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:36,960
administrator to create controlled

02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:39,600
environment for the

02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:41,359
user by customizing and locking almost

02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:45,359
any aspect

02:58:41,359 --> 02:58:49,200
of the configuration so basically

02:58:45,359 --> 02:58:52,240
you don't want the user to change the

02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:53,680
the font you you can say oh i want the

02:58:52,240 --> 02:58:56,560
phone to be imitable

02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:57,040
you do that on the configuration file

02:58:56,560 --> 02:59:00,120
and

02:58:57,040 --> 02:59:03,760
at the end the user are a

02:59:00,120 --> 02:59:06,399
configuration module with phone disabled

02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:08,240
so they consist one but can change that

02:59:06,399 --> 02:59:11,680
it's really important for

02:59:08,240 --> 02:59:14,880
enterprise called university and

02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:17,359
a lot of of area like that because

02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:18,319
in some cases we don't want to to let

02:59:17,359 --> 02:59:29,840
the user

02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:29,840
block the setup

02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:38,720
so what we see in the previous slide

02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:41,760
is we have problem with state of button

02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:42,479
not working and also imitability not

02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:45,760
working

02:59:42,479 --> 02:59:49,040
so we needed a solution to to fix that

02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:52,880
so a conflict xt was

02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:55,439
the chosen solution it's allow

02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:56,640
to use an existing system because

02:59:55,439 --> 03:00:00,000
configs

02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:00,640
already exist and have lots of benefits

03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,080
for us

03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:05,760
so config xt is based on config and it

03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:08,240
allowed to automatically

03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:10,160
automatically sync a widget and

03:00:08,240 --> 03:00:12,399
searching value

03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:14,960
the configuration entries are declared

03:00:12,399 --> 03:00:15,359
on an xml file i will show a bit of that

03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:18,880
work

03:00:15,359 --> 03:00:20,960
later and with the

03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:22,960
compiler you will generate simple

03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:26,000
surplus plus code

03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:28,000
automatically that you can use directly

03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,040
in fact you generate a config collet on

03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:33,279
subclass

03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:36,479
that generate for each configuration key

03:00:33,279 --> 03:00:38,080
a conflict skeleton item there is

03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:41,120
different kind of high temp

03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:45,040
uh if you for training for

03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:48,319
color for boolean and whatever

03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:49,840
and that we manage all things

03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:52,880
automatically for you

03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:56,319
so if you are using a newer file so

03:00:52,880 --> 03:00:58,880
yeah a bit old-fashioned nowadays we do

03:00:56,319 --> 03:01:00,880
everything in cute quick but at the time

03:00:58,880 --> 03:01:02,479
config xt was created it was not the

03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:07,439
case

03:01:02,479 --> 03:01:11,359
if you name a widget starting with kcfg

03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:14,479
as prefix and the key entry name

03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:17,279
as suffix it will automatically bind

03:01:14,479 --> 03:01:19,439
the settings data and the widget so it

03:01:17,279 --> 03:01:21,600
will be a bit of magic and

03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:22,640
everything will work by everything i

03:01:21,600 --> 03:01:26,160
mean

03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:28,640
the yellow button state will work so the

03:01:26,160 --> 03:01:29,279
we will enable or disable the default

03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:31,520
reset

03:01:29,279 --> 03:01:33,680
and apply button when it's needed so

03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:36,720
basically if you didn't change anything

03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:39,200
the apply button we will be disabled and

03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:40,479
rotate button will be disabled if you

03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:42,720
change one setting the

03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:44,319
boss will be enabled and if

03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:46,880
configuration

03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:48,399
are not like the default one the default

03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:50,960
button will be enabled

03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:53,200
and you don't have to to do the logic

03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:54,880
for all your items

03:01:53,200 --> 03:01:56,319
it will be android for free by

03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:58,479
configuring

03:01:56,319 --> 03:02:00,160
it's also taking consideration

03:01:58,479 --> 03:02:04,720
imitability and

03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:04,720
they will disable the binder widget

03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:10,160
and also the a nice thing it can be used

03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:12,479
to generate documentation of

03:02:10,160 --> 03:02:14,319
configuration option because like i said

03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:17,439
with kiosks you can

03:02:14,319 --> 03:02:21,200
change the configuration file mark some

03:02:17,439 --> 03:02:24,319
some items in the table

03:02:21,200 --> 03:02:27,520
but you firstly need to know the

03:02:24,319 --> 03:02:31,040
name of of those items and if you have

03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:34,080
also all that on an xml file

03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:36,160
cfg file is an xml file it will be easy

03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:39,040
to auto generate documentation to

03:02:36,160 --> 03:02:39,840
to show that but in this case there was

03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:42,880
some

03:02:39,840 --> 03:02:45,520
drawbacks we needed to port

03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:46,960
all module to it and yet there is tons

03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:50,080
of modules because

03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:52,880
plasma is slightly customizable

03:02:50,080 --> 03:02:53,359
and there was no cute quick support and

03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:57,120
like i

03:02:53,359 --> 03:02:58,479
said earlier the plan for the future was

03:02:57,120 --> 03:03:04,560
to have all modules

03:02:58,479 --> 03:03:04,560
on earthquake so it was a problem for us

03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:09,520
so the idea was to bring confederacy to

03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:12,880
cute quake

03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:16,240
i want to thank kevin tense for that he

03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:16,960
he did the first step the first workout

03:03:16,240 --> 03:03:20,479
on the

03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:23,680
time so basically food quick modules

03:03:20,479 --> 03:03:26,880
are based on config module

03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:28,080
so there was a creation of a managed

03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:30,800
config module

03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:31,279
that will extend config module with

03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:34,000
config

03:03:31,279 --> 03:03:34,960
extern support by registering the

03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,560
skeleton

03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:42,720
automatically this allowed to use the

03:03:38,560 --> 03:03:45,359
kcfg file again and manage config module

03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:46,399
take care of default state and stuff

03:03:45,359 --> 03:03:49,520
like that so

03:03:46,399 --> 03:03:52,720
this at the end the

03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:55,279
the dialog button will be

03:03:52,720 --> 03:03:57,120
on the good stage for free for us but

03:03:55,279 --> 03:03:59,680
for that we needed to port

03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:01,520
all modules from config module to manage

03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:05,040
config module

03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:08,160
and from config to to config xt

03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:11,520
by that i mean don't choose

03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:12,560
config directly but use the class

03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:15,680
generated

03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:19,359
by a config compiler and at the end in

03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:22,160
the qml side add setting state binding

03:04:19,359 --> 03:04:23,120
for for a graphical i item it will bind

03:04:22,160 --> 03:04:27,120
it to a

03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:30,319
to a certain entry and that will allow

03:04:27,120 --> 03:04:31,520
it to handle the immutability so

03:04:30,319 --> 03:04:34,720
basically

03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:36,080
if the item say oh it's in table we will

03:04:34,720 --> 03:04:39,200
disable

03:04:36,080 --> 03:04:41,840
the parent item so

03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:43,920
with that at the end it was a huge work

03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:47,359
to port

03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:50,240
not all but a lot of them to

03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:52,900
to manage config module and that brings

03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:55,950
us new idea

03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:55,950
[Music]

03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:04,640
the first idea was oh newcomers can be a

03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:07,040
bit lost on system setting because

03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:08,640
you know there is tons of settings so

03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:10,720
allowing them

03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:12,319
to find what differ from the best plasma

03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:15,120
configuration you know all that

03:05:12,319 --> 03:05:15,520
the best one is the default one can help

03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:18,640
them

03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:21,600
so basically when you are newcomers

03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:22,399
in lots of in general you play with

03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:25,439
settings because

03:05:22,399 --> 03:05:27,840
oh nice i can i can configure everything

03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:28,880
and at the end you say hmm i don't

03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:31,279
really like that

03:05:28,880 --> 03:05:32,000
it was better when i didn't change

03:05:31,279 --> 03:05:33,840
anything but

03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:35,920
you don't remember what you changed

03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:38,880
because you are crazy and you click

03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:40,000
everywhere so allowing user to know

03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:43,439
which module

03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:46,080
or exchange and when there are in this

03:05:43,439 --> 03:05:46,720
module which time or change can be

03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:50,640
really

03:05:46,720 --> 03:05:53,120
important and useful so yeah

03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:54,800
i guess a screenshot can let you

03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:58,000
understand a bit better

03:05:54,800 --> 03:06:00,800
so basically here we can see i change

03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:01,439
fonts i change startup and shutdown

03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:04,399
search

03:06:01,439 --> 03:06:06,560
and regional settings and fonts because

03:06:04,399 --> 03:06:09,840
there is an

03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:10,880
orange dot so you have a button to click

03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:16,240
to see that

03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:19,279
it will be available with plasma 519

03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:22,000
yes and on the

03:06:19,279 --> 03:06:23,760
model side you will see there is a for

03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:26,960
example the general font change

03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:30,720
so it's in rain and

03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:34,319
the anti-aliasing oh yeah plasma 5.20

03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:36,880
sorry uh uh so

03:06:34,319 --> 03:06:37,680
this will be orange when there are not

03:06:36,880 --> 03:06:40,640
defaults one

03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:41,279
so if i hit the default button i know

03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:45,760
exactly

03:06:41,279 --> 03:06:57,840
which we which settings will be

03:06:45,760 --> 03:06:57,840
revert to default value

03:06:58,560 --> 03:07:04,080
so oh that works so we

03:07:01,760 --> 03:07:05,359
we have used setting state binding again

03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:08,720
that will

03:07:05,359 --> 03:07:11,600
allow it to highlight them when needed

03:07:08,720 --> 03:07:13,040
there is still some limitation because

03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:15,439
it's still not done for

03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:16,319
all modules modern modules are done but

03:07:15,439 --> 03:07:19,600
still

03:07:16,319 --> 03:07:23,040
work on going uh it work

03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:26,399
only for confedex based module

03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:29,680
it's not exact but yeah mostly and

03:07:26,399 --> 03:07:33,279
work well with um

03:07:29,680 --> 03:07:36,160
with bluestem because we need the custom

03:07:33,279 --> 03:07:39,680
custom support on the time so other time

03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:42,640
we need to support it to highlight key

03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:43,600
and for the model this level we needed

03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:46,240
to load

03:07:43,600 --> 03:07:48,240
all modules when we start system setting

03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:51,279
not when we start but when we

03:07:48,240 --> 03:07:52,800
click the button to show to highlight

03:07:51,279 --> 03:07:55,760
defaults

03:07:52,800 --> 03:07:56,080
defaults module and the problem at this

03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:57,920
time

03:07:56,080 --> 03:07:59,120
it was if you want to load the module

03:07:57,920 --> 03:08:03,200
you needed to load

03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:06,720
ui too and it it was not

03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:09,920
ideal so we introduced kcm module data

03:08:06,720 --> 03:08:11,680
that will um handle settings and and

03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:13,840
expose them to kc module

03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:15,359
in fact in the past custom module user

03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:18,479
user directly

03:08:15,359 --> 03:08:20,640
kc module or config manager config

03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:24,160
module on cute quicksite

03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:26,240
and that will allow to split sli data

03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:28,240
and ui because in the past everything

03:08:26,240 --> 03:08:30,880
was declared in the same

03:08:28,240 --> 03:08:31,600
same place more or less now it's

03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:34,880
splitted

03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:35,920
so by regrouping all settings on the

03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:38,960
same place we can

03:08:35,920 --> 03:08:41,920
just load the settings without the ui

03:08:38,960 --> 03:08:42,960
and without the change that will be made

03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:44,720
if i

03:08:42,960 --> 03:08:46,479
change ui because i don't want to save

03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:47,279
it i just want to know what is on the

03:08:46,479 --> 03:08:50,319
disk

03:08:47,279 --> 03:08:53,920
and now we can ask easily a module about

03:08:50,319 --> 03:08:56,640
its default state and there is no

03:08:53,920 --> 03:08:57,359
performance issue in the future with

03:08:56,640 --> 03:09:00,640
with this

03:08:57,359 --> 03:09:04,399
we can imagine some user use case like

03:09:00,640 --> 03:09:04,399
improving module searchability

03:09:06,720 --> 03:09:10,399
so basically basically like i said we

03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:12,800
can improve system settings

03:09:10,399 --> 03:09:14,160
searchability we can query information

03:09:12,800 --> 03:09:16,800
from kcfg

03:09:14,160 --> 03:09:18,560
using kc module data to have up-to-date

03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:21,359
data because currently

03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:23,040
um search on system settings is done by

03:09:21,359 --> 03:09:26,880
looking at desktop file

03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:30,000
and if you add another

03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:32,800
field to settings you will probably not

03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:34,000
update the desktop file so it can be

03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:36,960
interesting

03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:38,479
to use it in the future and that can be

03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:41,120
used by a carbon or two

03:09:38,479 --> 03:09:41,840
to improve the carbon or discoverability

03:09:41,120 --> 03:09:44,880
too

03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:46,239
and another idea can be to highlight

03:09:44,880 --> 03:09:49,040
corresponding field

03:09:46,239 --> 03:09:49,840
so basically you see what we did with

03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:52,479
default

03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:54,479
we can imagine the same thing basically

03:09:52,479 --> 03:09:57,439
i search a general font

03:09:54,479 --> 03:09:58,399
and it will align general font so i know

03:09:57,439 --> 03:10:01,359
in which module

03:09:58,399 --> 03:10:03,359
is it and also which field is it because

03:10:01,359 --> 03:10:05,439
there is some module with tons of field

03:10:03,359 --> 03:10:07,680
and its art finds it

03:10:05,439 --> 03:10:10,080
but more generally we can imagine to

03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:11,040
interact with kcfg file data and have

03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:14,399
other id uh

03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:17,520
global work export or something else

03:10:14,399 --> 03:10:18,080
though is not idea i think we need to do

03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:21,359
but

03:10:18,080 --> 03:10:24,960
was what go to my head when i wrote

03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:27,680
this line and yeah basically it's

03:10:24,960 --> 03:10:29,520
people idea we can think about it it's

03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:31,439
pretty new so yeah

03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:33,600
let's see in the future what we can with

03:10:31,439 --> 03:10:33,600
it

03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:41,840
so if you want to be a wizard too

03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:41,840
you can use

03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:46,640
use it so basically you will need a full

03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:50,880
module data that will extend

03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:51,840
case module data this will register your

03:10:50,880 --> 03:10:54,399
full settings

03:10:51,840 --> 03:10:56,960
that was a class generated by your cfg

03:10:54,399 --> 03:10:57,760
file that exports item property then we

03:10:56,960 --> 03:11:00,000
will

03:10:57,760 --> 03:11:01,520
have a full module that generates manage

03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,000
config module and have a

03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:05,680
full module data attribute and you will

03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,640
expose the config skeleton

03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:10,479
so the full settings from custom module

03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:11,279
data shows the queue property so you can

03:11:10,479 --> 03:11:14,720
access it from

03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:17,840
uml and the qml code will bind item

03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:18,160
using setting state binding and you will

03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:21,439
do

03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:23,200
a bit of cement but

03:11:21,439 --> 03:11:26,880
i guess with a bit of code it will be

03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:26,880
more more clear

03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:30,800
so i took as example the desktops i'm

03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:33,520
saying because

03:11:30,800 --> 03:11:34,960
yeah it's an easy one there is only one

03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:38,800
entry

03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:42,720
so basically for the cfj side there is

03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:46,000
two files there is a kcfg file

03:11:42,720 --> 03:11:47,040
it is the files that declare to the

03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:49,040
compiler

03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:51,439
which file to compile the class name

03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:52,640
generated and some other extra data i

03:11:51,439 --> 03:11:55,680
will not

03:11:52,640 --> 03:11:59,279
go in the tiles here

03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:02,399
and then in the casi fg5 you can see

03:11:59,279 --> 03:12:06,080
your you have a group name as a

03:12:02,399 --> 03:12:08,160
filename is a configuration

03:12:06,080 --> 03:12:10,000
in the configuration file on your disk

03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:10,800
the group name will be the group and the

03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,800
entry name

03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:14,000
and you can also have a label currently

03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:15,840
we don't choose them

03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:17,760
but i i think in the future can be a

03:12:15,840 --> 03:12:20,880
good idea to to use them

03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:21,760
that can be useful for stuff like like

03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:26,160
search

03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:26,160
and there is also the default value

03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:37,680
so basically the case module data

03:12:32,960 --> 03:12:40,720
so yeah it's a non-interesting file

03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:44,000
it's just here to collect all settings

03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:47,760
or this is on the case uh you really use

03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:50,800
config xd for example for for sony

03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:52,960
sony based on cue settings

03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:54,800
uh there is a bit more of god but for

03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:57,200
lots of case there is no code and

03:12:54,800 --> 03:12:58,640
yeah there is an ongoing effort to have

03:12:57,200 --> 03:13:02,239
a semi-macro to

03:12:58,640 --> 03:13:04,960
generate it because yeah there there is

03:13:02,239 --> 03:13:06,319
no interest to write this code or it was

03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:09,279
basically the same

03:13:06,319 --> 03:13:09,279
for all modules

03:13:10,239 --> 03:13:14,560
so basically we have settings and we

03:13:12,479 --> 03:13:18,000
call auto register skeletons

03:13:14,560 --> 03:13:21,279
to register also all skeletons were

03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:24,479
two of them when we query it

03:13:21,279 --> 03:13:26,880
there is also the manage config module

03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:28,160
nothing really interesting here just we

03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:32,080
use

03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:34,560
the desktop and data created earlier and

03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:35,279
and we expose the other properties uh

03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:38,080
desktop

03:13:35,279 --> 03:13:38,560
setting and on the qml side we can see

03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:41,600
here

03:13:38,560 --> 03:13:42,319
the with the qml item is a great view

03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:45,439
cassiem

03:13:42,319 --> 03:13:48,560
is the the review for

03:13:45,439 --> 03:13:51,600
all tem modules and

03:13:48,560 --> 03:13:54,720
we bind it with a desktop temp settings

03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:57,520
and the thing name is a name so

03:13:54,720 --> 03:13:58,399
the name is the name of the theme and

03:13:57,520 --> 03:14:00,479
yeah we have a

03:13:58,399 --> 03:14:02,720
error an extra enabled condition is

03:14:00,479 --> 03:14:03,200
because setting state binding will do

03:14:02,720 --> 03:14:06,080
the

03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:07,600
imitable stuff but basically we will

03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:11,840
also want to disable

03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:11,840
if we are currently downloading a file

03:14:12,960 --> 03:14:18,239
but everything is not perfect

03:14:16,160 --> 03:14:20,239
all settings don't use config like i

03:14:18,239 --> 03:14:23,600
said sony user

03:14:20,239 --> 03:14:26,880
q settings and also your used

03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:28,800
so we can choose k-cfg file for them so

03:14:26,880 --> 03:14:30,319
car properties collect on item was

03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:33,600
introduced it

03:14:30,319 --> 03:14:37,439
enable us to declare

03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:40,239
to declare a skeleton manually and

03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:41,279
and synchronize them manually with gcom

03:14:40,239 --> 03:14:44,080
for q setting

03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:44,960
it's a lot more work but it will allow

03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:48,000
us

03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:50,640
to have something more homogeneous

03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,120
and on the binding part there is also

03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:53,840
some

03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:53,840
difficulty

03:14:54,399 --> 03:14:58,160
basically sometimes for i guess

03:14:56,640 --> 03:15:01,200
historical reason

03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:03,920
we have one configuration key

03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:05,279
bind to multiple widgets or the other

03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:09,040
way when we judge

03:15:05,279 --> 03:15:10,960
that that we have a multiple

03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:12,479
configuration case so yeah i guess in

03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:17,040
the future we need to

03:15:12,479 --> 03:15:19,760
to we need to prevent that because

03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:20,319
it's hard to maintain and yeah we can

03:15:19,760 --> 03:15:23,920
have

03:15:20,319 --> 03:15:27,279
auto binding so i think we need to

03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:28,160
to probably write um configuration

03:15:27,279 --> 03:15:30,800
immigration to

03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:32,160
avoid that because i'm not sure service

03:15:30,800 --> 03:15:37,600
really

03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:39,920
use case where we can do the other way

03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:41,680
so thank you for your attention and if

03:15:39,920 --> 03:15:43,680
you have any questions i

03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:45,040
i guess there is because chair node is

03:15:43,680 --> 03:15:48,080
right perfect

03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:50,080
timing okay

03:15:48,080 --> 03:15:51,520
so it looks like we have three questions

03:15:50,080 --> 03:15:53,680
so far

03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:56,000
one is still being said my favorite

03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:56,000
second

03:15:58,240 --> 03:16:02,880
[Music]

03:15:59,760 --> 03:16:02,880
or maybe we can make

03:16:07,840 --> 03:16:13,120
make it easier to make variants of the

03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:17,840
appearance of specific settings

03:16:13,120 --> 03:16:17,840
if desired

03:16:18,399 --> 03:16:22,960
i'm not trying to understand the

03:16:20,160 --> 03:16:22,960
question

03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:32,399
the question is still

03:16:28,880 --> 03:16:35,040
so yeah we as i know

03:16:32,399 --> 03:16:35,840
for now we can't disable uh hide

03:16:35,040 --> 03:16:39,040
settings

03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:41,840
but yeah we can we can disable them

03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:44,319
uh i'm not sure there is plan to hide

03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:47,040
them perhaps someone else knows that but

03:16:44,319 --> 03:16:47,040
yeah not sure

03:16:48,239 --> 03:16:53,120
all right well let's go to the next the

03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:55,120
first question i suppose

03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:56,560
what should i do when i can't base my

03:16:55,120 --> 03:16:59,920
module on

03:16:56,560 --> 03:17:02,080
k config xt

03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:03,040
for example for highlighting change

03:17:02,080 --> 03:17:08,000
settings

03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:11,040
can i still use kc module data

03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:14,000
i'm asking for global shortcuts

03:17:11,040 --> 03:17:15,920
so don't know how i would use k property

03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:18,640
skeleton item

03:17:15,920 --> 03:17:20,239
so basically it's the case of sony that

03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:23,680
don't choose really

03:17:20,239 --> 03:17:25,040
config extra directly so yeah you can

03:17:23,680 --> 03:17:28,720
still use

03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:31,279
kc module data because

03:17:28,720 --> 03:17:32,560
it will be just more works because you

03:17:31,279 --> 03:17:34,960
will need to under

03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:36,080
what is default and yeah when you

03:17:34,960 --> 03:17:39,840
inherit

03:17:36,080 --> 03:17:40,720
provider is default method to highlight

03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:43,840
default settings

03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:45,920
also it's doable but it will need

03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:48,160
more work because you will need to do

03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:51,200
everything more or less manually

03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:52,960
and we have done that for some modules i

03:17:51,200 --> 03:17:56,880
don't remember which one but

03:17:52,960 --> 03:18:00,000
yeah we we we did that so

03:17:56,880 --> 03:18:03,680
i hope i answered to this question

03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:06,960
okay well next question then

03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:07,760
we can have when can we have a system

03:18:06,960 --> 03:18:10,000
that syncs

03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:11,600
all my plasma and kde app settings to

03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:15,680
the cloud so it gets

03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:15,680
recreated when i reinstall

03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:22,319
so when someone will do that

03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:24,960
i don't know there is no plan for that

03:18:22,319 --> 03:18:26,960
uh yeah a good solution is not to

03:18:24,960 --> 03:18:27,760
reinstall but yeah i know sometimes we

03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:31,520
change

03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:33,840
setup so it's needed uh you can probably

03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:34,640
already export your configuration file

03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:37,520
but there will

03:18:34,640 --> 03:18:38,720
be perhaps some stuff you don't want

03:18:37,520 --> 03:18:41,760
anymore

03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:44,720
but yeah there is no plan

03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:45,439
plan at all as far as i know to save

03:18:44,720 --> 03:18:49,520
stuff for

03:18:45,439 --> 03:18:52,800
to the cloud no but can be a good idea

03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:54,720
awesome okay last question unless one

03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:58,560
more trickles in

03:18:54,720 --> 03:19:01,520
will k config config xt

03:18:58,560 --> 03:19:02,880
incorporate kiosk functionalities or

03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:06,720
kiosks will exist

03:19:02,880 --> 03:19:07,439
as an individual app so kiosk is not an

03:19:06,720 --> 03:19:10,720
application

03:19:07,439 --> 03:19:12,000
is a framework so basically is a what

03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:14,319
enable to

03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:15,439
to put in the configuration stuff like

03:19:14,319 --> 03:19:18,640
immutability

03:19:15,439 --> 03:19:21,200
it exists i guess from decade now

03:19:18,640 --> 03:19:22,479
it's not something new it's something

03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:25,840
used in the past

03:19:22,479 --> 03:19:28,319
in at some times it was not working

03:19:25,840 --> 03:19:29,120
anymore as expected because some stuff

03:19:28,319 --> 03:19:31,600
are broken

03:19:29,120 --> 03:19:34,080
but it exists and there is some no

03:19:31,600 --> 03:19:36,080
nothing new and there is no up for that

03:19:34,080 --> 03:19:39,120
uh i guess we expect a system

03:19:36,080 --> 03:19:44,479
administrator to write the configuration

03:19:39,120 --> 03:19:44,479
directly on their favorite text editor

03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:51,279
all right well it looks like we have no

03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:54,399
more questions coming in

03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:59,120
and you have lots of claps in the chat

03:19:54,399 --> 03:19:59,120
