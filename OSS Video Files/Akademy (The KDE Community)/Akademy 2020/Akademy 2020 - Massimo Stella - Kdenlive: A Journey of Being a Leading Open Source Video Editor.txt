[Music]

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,679
thank you

00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,519
[Music]

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,520
and i think it's the beginning so i

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,199
thought okay so

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,600
uh to begin first of all i have to

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
okay i'm here to introduce katie alive

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,279
first the mission is that

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,880
but before the beginning i want to

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,160
thanks all the community of course and

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,679
the kd love community

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
in specifically because and

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,079
jean-baptiste mardel and for this point

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,120
after why i do that and

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,399
so when they asked me to arrange this

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
meeting they asked me to

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
talk about what scheduling life is where

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,840
it comes from how it is

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,320
that he has 200 000 um downloading for

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,640
one

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
reason

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
so i was checking with slides stuff like

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,039
that and certainly

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
but i have to talk about the video

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,199
editor so what's the best

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
with it is doing what a video that i

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,540
showed you

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:24,210
now if i can control it

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:24,910
[Music]

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,000
[Applause]

00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,000
[Music]

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
to deliver a free and open video editing

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
software application

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
to allow allow everybody to produce

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,840
quality content in order in order to

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
increase the democratization of the

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,960
media

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
the application is a graphic interface

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
written in c

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,439
plus plus with qt and kde libraries for

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,399
the mlt framework written by dandenity

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,960
which relies on ffmpeg to decode and

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
encode

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
almost all the video and audio formats

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,759
that are out today

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,439
and which host effects libraries like

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,640
freyor and move it for video

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,320
and ladspa and socks for audio by

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,520
following the official documents that we

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,360
can find on the internet

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
the project was launched by jason wood

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,440
who released version 0.2.3

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
in october 2003.

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,319
soon katie and live 0.2.4 followed

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
but the community did not yet exist and

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,280
the group was very small

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,920
the project stopped for two years

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
before the end of 2005 jean-baptiste

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
mardell

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
who heard that the project would be

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,160
reactivated offered his help

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,879
and in 2006 he signed the post of the

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
new release

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,760
0.3 of the program from this moment on

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,319
he became the main reference point for

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
the project

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,879
version 0.4 and 0.5 are soon distributed

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
but there is an issue a refactoring of

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,239
the code is needed to go

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,040
forward the program has to be moved from

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,239
kde 3 which is not compatible with mlt

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,400
to kde 4. the rewriting ends in 2008

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,440
followed by several new releases but in

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,879
2011 a further migration from kde 4 to

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,239
kde 5 was needed

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,239
to allow the program to grow

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
in 2012 a crowdfunding campaign is

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,760
launched to fund the operation

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,480
and before the end of 2014 the goal is

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,920
reached

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,959
then finally in 2015 kdnlive becomes an

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,840
official kde

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,480
application john baptist was invited to

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
academy

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,519
to present 10 years of activity the new

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,990
perspective is to make the project even

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,519
bigger

00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,200
[Music]

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
before the end of the year the first

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,120
acadian live cafe is announced with the

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,720
aim of getting more people involved

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
during this virtual meeting it

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
immediately became clear that in order

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
to grow

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,959
kitty and live needed to be

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,519
cross-platform the windows version was

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,000
announced and 2016 began with a sprint

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,680
meeting

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
followed by the new logo and the new

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
site but as soon as the development of

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
new features started it was evident that

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
the code for the timeline had to be

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
rewritten

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,640
because it was too old and no longer fit

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
everybody knew that the refactoring

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,840
could take several months or years

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,159
but the community did not lose

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,200
enthusiasm

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,400
in 2018 a new roadmap was written and in

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,159
the refactored code was distributed

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,439
although some fine tuning was still

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
needed

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
to overcome this the focus of the

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
community in 2020

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,720
has revolved around fixing and improving

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,280
the program the result of this

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
is the latest version 20.08 which

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,639
delivers stability

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
several new features and a new interface

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,430
with five workspaces

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
[Music]

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,400
[Applause]

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,880
[Music]

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
okay so this is the video i want to

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
present

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,919
you so i guess that is now i have

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
nothing more to say about the predator

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,240
the software

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,400
i want to show you the software itself

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,600
it's where the moment is

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,520
duck okay allow

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,759
so i am in the sorter i would like to

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,080
check if you see the same stuff i'm just

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,120
watching okay this is the project

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,160
we i realized to show you the video we

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
just

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
do as you can see it's pretty easy we

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
have our been arranged but we

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,280
start from i want to show you but the

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,039
application this was my intent actually

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,440
to show you a little bit application

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,919
when i'm waiting for question etc so we

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
start a new project and we try to show

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,039
you this fantastic five workspace

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,280
we're speaking about at the end of the

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,759
video i thank you sean ranci for the

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,160
fantastic voice he put on the video

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
so this is as you can see in this corner

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
up corner

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,479
on the left right we set these

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,840
this workspace that

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,120
are usable for the different step of the

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,240
work you can of course change the

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,520
you can overwrite or save the layout i

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
can see and you create

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
also new slot and reset what is the

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
default

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,960
set so we choose to use this kind of

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,680
space for some reason for example the

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
login

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,160
i hope i'm not going too far

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,479
your camera microphone and big

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,680
shared okay yes it's just an announcer

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,240
check my situation because okay

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
i go back on the program so um this is

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,919
the bean

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
i am informing you that the interface is

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
actually made by

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
by widget so this is the list of the

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
widget we can have

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
the bar so as you can see there are

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
actually window we can move

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
vertically horizontally i remove this

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
and so

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
actually the digits of this object

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,319
appears in a different

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,120
situation in different position for the

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
reason i

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,479
want to explain it so in the to ingest

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
our material in the bin we have

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,720
different ways with for example we can

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,160
open from here we can right click on the

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,280
bean here or we can

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,560
we can even import thing

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,160
for example dragging straight from the i

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
just need to switch the project because

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,440
it's interlaced materials it's correct

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,639
to do

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,720
um or in if you are in advanced uh

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
for example anything we can even drop a

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
i show you after

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
drop straight away in the timeline and

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,000
the clip is

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
added to the project automatically what

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,280
is interesting here we have

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,319
for example here um a clip with

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,199
two different audio streams one is

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,039
you can see the um environment have been

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,039
monophonic the other was the microphone

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
they was turned off in the moment

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,639
what's interesting in a new for example

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,039
feature about the

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
the waveform is that you can see when

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,280
you go here you can even scrub

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
the audio you can even with controller

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,440
or mouse roll you can even

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
go in this is maybe not the best clip to

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
show because it's not so long enough

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
after when we

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,039
talk about audio i'll show you better

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
anyway in

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,520
in the video clip we have the the audio

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
visualization with if with the clip is

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,800
more

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,720
audio we can in the properties select

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,360
without you want to use

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,440
or merge the two together we have the

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
same

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,120
option here and i remind you that the

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
recent flickering live has a chance to

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,240
drive adjust the video the audio on

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
the timeline while i show you this later

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,599
but interesting here that

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
for example if we have a specific

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,919
indication this movie is not

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
the most interesting picture maybe

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,280
someone is talking

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,039
and i ingest something else we have a

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,440
reference point here we can

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,479
add for example a market put a note for

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
example

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,479
interesting stuff um

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
at this point when we need to go back in

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
this point in the clip

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
if we are just to click on the point and

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
we of course

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,200
we go back in the part we can of course

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,640
add remove etc

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,640
in the second space we have i can ingest

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,880
more we can go back and we ingest

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,920
more uh for example i prepare a folder

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,399
with some stuff

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,800
i will just this six audio source

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,640
extreme i'll do some audio

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,480
uh this is pretty heavy so i don't know

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
we have to wait okay ingest everything

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,959
and when i waiting

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,800
that the machine do that i stay back in

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,800
camera because they told me that

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
there's light could be if everything is

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,200
working i have no feedback

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,080
it's okay now when everything is ready

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
okay

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
um i wait a little bit of time because

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,760
here there is some also 4k

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:37,279
footage that uh person helped me to do

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,440
um okay i'll go back to the editing

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,519
i can show you some interesting stuff

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,360
for example for example about the audio

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,399
in the monitor we have just not

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,640
improved i can show you with other for

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,680
example this one is

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,760
that we have the

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
audio as i show you it is easier to

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,160
understand what i mean before

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,600
now i go to every audio clip this is

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,480
actually the music for example

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,920
i used i used for the clip what is

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,600
interesting now we can scrub the audio

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
we can scrub the audio we have this

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,360
ruler this rule is delightful because

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,079
when we want to drag and drop

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,839
people we can handle the clip from the

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,760
space like you can see

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
but if we want we want to scroll we can

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,720
scroll

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,480
also with the control roll up row we can

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,399
also navigate

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:33,839
the audio and then if we play

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,839
of course sorry if we play

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,160
follow us what is interesting about i'm

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,720
not editing anything

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,360
about it for example i'll show you like

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,480
bring in sign

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,040
some footage that i six out of six

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
eight of the stream sorry uh this is

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
eight of the stream is because the

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,560
camera is doing this way

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,079
and i can show you the properties

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
so this is the for example because

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,040
camera that use two channels for

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,399
any proposal but for example we can see

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,440
that we have three

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,839
full channel a three empty channel so we

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
can for example deselect the channel we

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
don't need

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
at this point for example we drag now i

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
prefer to

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,040
throw the audio we can drag drag that to

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,079
audio just we want

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,640
if someone inside is a three point edit

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,680
i

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,079
would here that i remind you that this

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,040
is

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,519
the source of all so these listed what

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
we have

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,279
one video source in this case two audio

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
source because it's one we've selected

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,560
but if you want more track

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,360
we're much better and more are you

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,920
selected with all the sources

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
for example we implement this stuff that

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
allow you to

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,720
allow us to select the audio that is

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,360
the track so when we decide for example

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,399
to put

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,120
the audio sorry to don't put audio here

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,720
for example

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,639
but put just here with

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,680
so we can select where things go

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,639
then to be simple this is the aud

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,760
improvement that

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,760
it's actually it's uh allow us to select

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,959
the stream we want it was a feature that

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
people ask about

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,880
if we are in the audio modality next

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
i want to show you we have this mixer

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,920
but if

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,040
we for example the number of tracks just

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,160
to show you

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,620
what happened if i for example

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,279
insert

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,320
[Music]

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,360
six five all your tracks

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,200
this our mixer is a

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
grow with the tracks we need in the

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,120
mixer we have the way to call the

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,560
as here the uh filter for the track if

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,680
you want oh sorry

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,800
if you want to insert

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,000
some audio filter for example here we

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
have just for example

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
to drag and drop on the clip and we can

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
add here of course the

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,959
volume can be applied also to the track

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
and so we have also keyframe for the

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,200
track

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
in this way we have a video monitor for

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,440
our

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,560
and so we have also um this is not super

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,639
volume audio but

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,440
in the in case we have i take something

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,920
more interesting in my voice speaking

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,279
that

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,360
we have before i don't find it anymore

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,440
okay here

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
so we have for example the

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,839
representation

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
here not working

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,680
enough i put the music probably so

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,519
but it's supposed to work regularly

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,800
because it's always worked

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,079
we have a monitor in this moment

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,880
this is maybe after this is not the best

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
doing live anyway next step is the

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
effect

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,160
that allow us for example if you want to

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,000
call or

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,440
a clip we can use for example we are in

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,120
video filter yeah for example transform

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,320
you can use that also we can

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,920
have on the right click from here so

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,040
when we use the transform we have a

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,720
very big panel with our keyframes here

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,399
for example we can

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,120
do stupid stuff like rotating a clip

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,720
so we see that from point to point we

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,880
rotate

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,839
okay we rotate the clip from point to

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
point

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,720
as you suppose

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,800
the last space is the color space

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,360
that allow us to this for example they i

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,920
want this moment this moment as a audio

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,959
clip but actually the idea to put this

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,160
here is for example we have to match two

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,839
different scenes

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,399
this could be used as a reference

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,600
monitor because tell us which is the

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,959
imaging we have to match if the clip

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,240
for example is already on the timeline

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,120
and is treated with some

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,360
filters we can i remember you that we

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,399
can select the clip with the filters if

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,440
we need the create with the library

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,399
um copyright

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,279
test to make a color correction then we

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,639
can

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,839
add the test to our being

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,800
and then one is in the line in the

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
project we can

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,720
use i hope is the correct clip because i

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,759
do a test before

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,199
and so maybe i rename with the same name

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,040
and so so this is what i want to say

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,800
about the workspace coming back

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,800
so i have to close here

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:55,120
okay now this is what it is

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,800
i have to load back so

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
my video something

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
uh

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,480
and sorry for intel so interruption

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,800
um what i want to say that this is the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,480
explanation of the new stuff in canadian

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
live i showed you the mixer i show you

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
the fact that we have the monitor or the

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
audio on the

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,279
way without the the workspace that

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
arranged it to publish a better

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,000
workflow and a lot of new stuff i'll

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
show you the project when i created this

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
video so to show you that it's possible

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,639
to create professional video with the

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
tool because it's very advanced at this

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,480
point

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,320
someone asked me about what is the

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,160
the future of the of the problem the

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,240
future the programming we have a very

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
interesting roadmap for example we are

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,399
developing this moment

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
the same track transition that is to

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,759
save so

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,600
space on the track run we need to fade

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,079
the crossfade although the transition

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,639
between

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,480
clip in the plan there is also an

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,240
improved nesting for the future with

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
multiple timelines it will be possible

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,839
as soon as possible and the

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,279
advancing trimming tools then probably

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,279
will try to finish

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,360
the audi that we already in going

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,520
directional multi-channels also

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
routing and mapping of the channels in

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,760
the future to make

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,799
complete the out environment and after

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
that i guess that

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,280
we go deep in the filters of secondary

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,679
correction and reset and

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,360
readjusted all the filter incorporate

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,039
probably also isn't a road map is

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,079
possible some ai tool like

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,559
frame boosting like a super resolution

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
maybe

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,320
speech to text and what else on the long

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
long future

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,679
that this is on the short future because

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
with these three tools i told you we

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,240
probably reached the state

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,799
of the main main um

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,679
we can find in the industry then in the

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,320
future maybe

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,039
also we can see also there is a guy

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,720
before

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,360
sorry for they talk about incorporate

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,799
um kda in android maybe a mobile

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,600
application maybe a server application

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,480
maybe introduce the vr360 or stereoscopy

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,240
we'll see

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,280
but now we have the urgency to reach a

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,840
level to move from here already to me

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,320
adapt for youtubers maybe to evolve to

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
even

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,520
better you never need to means for

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
example

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
next step to me is television production

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,200
for example because uh

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
it will be very reliable and very fast

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,240
the software

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,600
and the we are to me we are almost there

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
uh to say about the other software

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,799
actually the competitor means that

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
the no competitor the the software they

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,520
ask money and their property

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,480
they are not too far in my opinion and

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
they have not

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,600
new implementation except they are

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,480
checking just to ai

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,720
to make automatic editing that for the

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,360
moment google and adobe mostly

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
are pretty still pretty amatorial stuff

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,720
is not

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,720
not so promising promising anything

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,039
we'll see what happens this step so is

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,120
short to me to reach

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,160
to be there to be totally professional

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,799
so i really

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,080
believe that they are on the right way

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,120
and what i can say about

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
the open source uh in general open

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,000
source uh

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,440
software in the in the industry of the

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
media i must say that there are

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
interesting very interesting projects

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,039
that some in national television reading

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,320
corporate for example norway television

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,280
or religion television and sweden

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,919
television

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,960
as a workforce completely for uh talk

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,440
shows news and

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,400
broadcasting now mostly of information

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,799
based on

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,559
open software that with in the center is

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,320
frequently mlt

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,679
by academy live you know it's better i'm

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,799
ltz on the video

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,760
and um and i see for example in norway

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,480
and um sweden television they have all

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,600
complete

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,360
line of workflow on open software except

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
for the video editor so we

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,440
aim to go there as soon as possible to

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,799
become the video editors or reference

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,559
for these

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,720
people that choose already open software

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,160
to implement their own

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,039
their own services so if you i guess i

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,440
don't know i

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,720
still always so fast and if i consume

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
all the time so i

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,880
if it's there is sometimes i'm ready for

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,039
a question i'll listen to that

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,039
yep

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,280
okay i was too short too long towards

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,520
too much

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,960
it was okay perfect thank you okay

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,120
i'm really progressing no

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,559
you're on perfect time so let's get

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,840
going with the first question you have

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,360
oh good all right first one what is your

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,400
perspective

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:33,280
on titling and title transitions

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,960
in editor has come a long way in the

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,240
past few years

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,520
but it seems preferable to import

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,480
titles as svgs

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,120
are there any discussions on advancing

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,600
how caden live handles these titles

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,880
okay there is reduction so

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,919
now okay where is it thank you for the

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,000
question and you know

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,960
this makes a big awkward actually

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,640
because there is a conversation

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,120
to me the title has to be a very um

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,120
compositing compositional static object

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,200
that you're animating timeline to be

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,159
about the music on the all the time like

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,039
i do already

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,320
i animate all the time and actually i

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,320
start with slides so i

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,840
put the object like to check the story

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,960
then i choose the music after

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,039
so anyway the synchronization between

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,280
the sound for example

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,000
i i use the title for example the role

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,240
that comes up in front inside of fm peg

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,360
i make a roller crawl title and on the

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
title then i

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,840
would with dropping i cut the bottom

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,400
actually scroll naturally

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,400
position inside the title they probably

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
found that for example i prefer another

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
software when you

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,520
when your animation you extend the time

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,880
of the title animation fit exactly for

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
example you have a crawler three second

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
but you need

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,559
five seconds to extend and the crawl

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
automatically adapt

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,880
to the side and the animation inside the

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
title there sometimes create problem to

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,960
adapt into my opinion

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,360
but zipper now is done the title we have

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,280
now

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,679
is a little bit rigid there'll be some

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,640
undo some features that are important

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
and to align the text is not bad in my

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
opinion

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,600
it creates problem because for example i

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,360
use the title created with that with

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,799
a composition to change to deform it and

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,520
use another way

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,720
and they randomly green so the title has

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,200
has to be

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,960
refined absolutely but to me is not the

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,440
biggest problem in the moment so i guess

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,520
anyway we have a project a kill that

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,240
entered to work on uh i guess it was

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,080
opengl

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
to make an animation software and not

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
against the animation title because

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,400
animated title can

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,840
import um preset that other people

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
community can create so we can an

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,760
animation to share

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,440
also 3d it's maybe a simple default

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,600
setup to have

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,679
but we'll see the time achille actually

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
say goodbye because it has to go i know

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,960
that

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,880
is uh it's important for him by let a

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,240
lot of job if someone will collect a

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,080
deal a legacy

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
we can go forward the sooner with the

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,360
title if possible the community is a

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,559
secret so more we are

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,039
better we can do faster as possible

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,559
absolutely okay all right shall we move

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,520
to the next question

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,440
sure of course all right it says do you

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,520
have statistics on the number of

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,919
installs

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,559
okay i i'm not the one who checked this

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,840
stuff with

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
oregon that uh gave also the number two

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,960
thousand

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,799
and uh two hundred thousand come from a

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
chart in the in the group that they

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,480
communicate the numbers so i refer

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:41,440
to that it's not even essay from 16

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,400
uh april to 16 august so what there is a

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,679
2004 was but i know that linux is the

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,279
minority still

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,520
and the fact that the community have

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,360
this number because we are

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,880
windows absolutely now windows service

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
start to be stable

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,640
i was very favorable i don't use windows

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,440
absolutely

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,520
but the fact i moved to linux probably

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,880
more than five six years ago completely

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,760
except for the editing that

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,720
uh on on the spot when i have to produce

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,799
very fast i

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,880
need to for the moment to be super

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,440
edible kidney lab is the next step i

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
guess in

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,360
during the next 12 months we will go

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,720
forward this way i will adopt in rare

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,200
production for

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,840
for television on the spot that means uh

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
fast available stable and

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,919
and because sometimes you have to edit

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,600
really a piece of news in 30 minutes

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,919
so two minutes until enough of that

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,200
finish that we broadcast for maybe

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
a main television like ryan italy or

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
the swiss and television german

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,840
television french television so

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,279
this is the so i will do i will do soon

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,240
so this is what

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,080
it's my next to test it and so when it

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,000
will be ready for a year and i want to

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,000
spread the more possible

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,240
because this is the goal the goal of the

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,240
open source is to spread and enter

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,520
everywhere is possible

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,039
so this is the idea uh this is statistic

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,279
i don't know i know that 20

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,480
20 000 i guess is uh linux and 180 000

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
in the windows

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
download i hope that we go cross

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,000
platform soon with the

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,600
mac os because they can make a

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,440
difference in spreading because

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:19,279
windows in big companies mostly but

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,679
apple is loved by by people that have a

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,960
big

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,440
company so professionals people like

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
that

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,600
sorry if i extended give me the time

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,799
because i'm invading

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,400
so we are on the last minute so you can

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,520
squeeze in one last question

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,080
and the last two that are there you can

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,720
take a look in the shower okay i read it

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
i i

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,760
think if you make a sentence to answer

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
to everybody in one video do you think

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,720
there's a

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,880
testicular professional video editor is

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,880
so that me okay these are the reasons

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
so i'm ready to use it as soon as

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,679
possible any position to allow

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,600
integrated with remote cloud

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,679
the idea to make a server version it

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,039
could be in the spot accessory exactly

00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,520
in my notes there is already some

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,960
hundred

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,960
making actually project like that

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,720
because servering could be very

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,000
interesting when you work on mostly in

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
the information so when you're in the

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,559
spot

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,039
you can ingest from the spot and people

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,559
from the side also for remote working

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,799
in editing this is very interesting

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,120
topic actually uh

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,640
oh yeah sorry remote cloudy exhibit i

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,240
don't know about ai service i don't know

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,480
i know we have to see

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,000
maybe my opinion is better to integrate

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
already model exist already

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
calculated the tool that the filter

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,120
works on the local machine for

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,360
this mostly my orientation of course

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,440
what about the coupling the render from

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,120
the application so we can never render

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,440
from from video rendering

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,760
locally oftentimes a process so

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,880
this is more technical aspect a farm

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,080
rendering i guess

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,080
is possible to implement but

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,760
i don't know if he's on the list

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,559
actually it could be interesting but i

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,720
is

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,000
this is mostly for main main rendering

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,640
so maybe if you make

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,600
big animation because actually to normal

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
job

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,720
i didn't have some problem with

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,880
rendering so to produce for example

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,240
three minutes an hour two graphic

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,919
animation means creature i have no

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,880
material stay home

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,480
i spend writing and taking all of the

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,159
assets and everything i spend less than

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
two days so it's possible to

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,159
you and i i use the preview rendering

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,600
that is sometimes is

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,039
lost to the rendering i finished last

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,840
question other than the future you think

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,000
is essential but currently

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
the the road map is already set to based

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,159
on priorities to me now priority is a

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,720
single threat transition to renew the

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,760
space and boosting the the

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,080
the performances and then uh

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,520
have a multiple timeline that is change

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
completely to me the aspect of the

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,440
program for

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,880
motivation that's all i i'm sorry i

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
invaded the space

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,840
i

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:11,440
thank you for inviting me and thank you

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:11,440
