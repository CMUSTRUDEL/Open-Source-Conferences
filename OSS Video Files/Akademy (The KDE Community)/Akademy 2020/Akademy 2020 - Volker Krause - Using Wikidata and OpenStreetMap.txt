Description: 
	Wikidata and OpenStreetMap (OSM) are probably the largest Open Data pools in the world, and they contain an incredible wealth of information we can freely use to build digital assistance features for our applications and platforms.

The rise of digital assistance features has shown that it's no longer enough to just focus on freely available source code to build such systems, the data needed for those is equally important. Fortunately, we do have two gigantic general-purpose data sets that model "the world", Wikidata and OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Wikidata contains more than eight billion statements about almost 100 million items, and allows to model basically any kind of fact that isn't entirely transient. Containing also localized names and accompanied by more than 60 million media assets in Wikimedia Commons, Wikidata isn't limited to purely machine readable data, but also provides useful elements for presenting results to humans.

OSM contains about 60GB worth of spatial data, ranging from country borders all the way down to individual streetlamps, and everything in between. A large variety of semantic annotations and cross-links to other databases such as Wikidata enable use-cases way beyond merely displaying a map.

In this talk we will look at how those two data sets are structured, how they can be accessed, how to comply with their licenses, and how we can make use of them for our applications.
