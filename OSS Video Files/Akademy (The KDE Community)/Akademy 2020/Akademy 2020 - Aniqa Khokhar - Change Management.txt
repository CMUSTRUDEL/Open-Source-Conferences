Understanding and accepting change is not easy. There have been times where KDE has moved to a new platform and switch was not easy. We need to understand all aspects of change with importance to accept change. We have to understand that change not only gives the organization a significant advantage but it also helps us to progress over others. So, what are the effective ways to manage, accept, and increase acceptance to change?
In this talk, we will improve our capability to understand and manage change. We will learn how to best roll out a change within KDE.

We will be able to:
• understand the critical role of change management
