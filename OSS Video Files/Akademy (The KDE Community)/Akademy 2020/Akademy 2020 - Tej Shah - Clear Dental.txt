Title: Akademy 2020 - Tej Shah - Clear Dental
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The presentation will go over the scope, basic design, history, current status and the future of Clear.Dental. This presentation will also go over some of the major hurdles in using Linux and FLOSS in a clinical environment and recommendations to other people trying to move EHR to a more FLOSS friendly environment. I will probably also end the presentation with recommendation to the KDE team for features that would be very useful in a dental clinic.

[Music]

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,960
so i apologize in advance if i'm going

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,960
really fast

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
but i put a little bit too much content

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
here uh

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,320
this is a quick outline of all the

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,320
categories that i'm going to go over

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,439
so brief introduction on who i am um i

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,720
graduated from carnegie mellon back in

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,560
2006 in

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,480
information systems human computer

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,079
interaction and computer science

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
i worked as a software engineer for

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
lockheed martin for a couple years

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
i also worked for a company called ics

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
where i got much more

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,559
familiar with cute and qml and then i

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
did the most

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
logical next step for my career and went

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
to dental school

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,320
so i graduated from tufts in 2015

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,239
and i've been working as a actual

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
practicing dentist for the last couple

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,640
years in

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
different kind of environments large

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
corporations small private practices as

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,160
a local tenants

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,520
basically i got a lot of diverse

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,280
experience

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,320
um working in very different fast

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,920
working different areas so

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,840
um before i go over over actual clear

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,439
dental let's talk about how

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
other dental software looks like

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,880
so the big problem right now is this

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,520
kind of chicken in the egg problem where

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,479
all the actual dental software is made

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
for windows

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,159
and so all the accompanying software is

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,640
made for windows as well

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,280
so it's really hard to get out of this

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
loop

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
so that keeps not only linux but other

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
operating system like mac os

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,799
out of this loop so there's the new pan

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,240
machine great

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
but you can't hook it up to a mac

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,399
machine you have to run windows in a

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,079
virtual environment just to be able to

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,079
take that special kind of rear graph

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,159
x-ray

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,320
and the actual existing software for

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
charting for taking care of your

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
patients

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,960
is very unintuitive even for doctors

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,399
what does this button do i don't know

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
you have to take a two week long

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,640
training just to understand what it's

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
really doing

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,760
is this just saying okay i want to try

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
and plan something for the upper arch or

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,080
is this trying to say i'm making a

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
denture

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
it's not really at all intuitive there's

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,599
a lot of buttons there's a lot of

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
options

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,520
and a lot of times you don't even know

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,760
if you're doing the right thing

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,680
and just to even keep track of what

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,959
you've done and what you need to do

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,000
all you see is just a line by line a lot

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,319
of mishmash of things that

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
you don't really understand where you

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
are

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
overall and then on top of that it's

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,360
more or less a

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
um almost like an excel spreadsheet it

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
doesn't

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,879
really get you an idea of what you're

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,160
trying to do for the patients

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
this is another uh this is called eagle

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
soft

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,959
it's another popular one it has some of

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
the same ideas which is let's

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,720
give the user a bunch of buttons let's

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
use non-standard

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
icons that nobody else will understand

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,120
and let's just do a line by line

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,200
nothing that any doctor can really

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,400
understand

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,120
so how does that really work in a dental

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
environment

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
well because it's not really that user

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,599
friendly

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,120
you tend to see doctors actually avoid

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,680
using the computer as much as possible

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,799
so it's a dirty environment it's a wet

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,319
environment

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
you don't want to really get the

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,720
computer in your way

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
so you literally have situations where

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
you have the doctor

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,200
training the patient you have your

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,959
assistance that is not doing the suction

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,879
right now but eventually she will be

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,159
and then you literally have somebody

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,280
dedicated to

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
writing all the case notes on a piece of

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
paper

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,439
and then typing it again on the computer

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,760
um this is from a colleague of mine

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,599
now we're in a post coven environment

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,560
where we want to get everything

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,480
nice and sterilized um she is right now

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
wearing all the good ppe

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,159
lots of gloves the patient's nice and

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,599
protective of a vacuum

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,439
and of course i thought it was kind of

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,120
funny that okay what if she wanted to

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,319
use the computer to look something up

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
really quickly

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,440
well this entire environment doesn't

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
really lend itself to keyboard and mouse

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,479
yes you could get one of those kind of

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,160
keyboards that

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,600
can be sterilized but they're really

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
hard to type on

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,120
and you have to literally drop what

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,680
you're doing in order to actually use

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
the computer

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
so there are three major goals of

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
clear.dental

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,360
one is to make everything as open source

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
as possible there is actually another

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
project called

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,160
open dental which is itself open source

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,720
but it requires an proprietary operating

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
system

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
a proprietary drivers and proprietary

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
image viewers

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,919
so it does a very small subset of what a

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,400
doctor needs to do

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
the main idea of clear dental is to make

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
everything

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,560
more open source the second goal is to

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
think more like a dentist so you want to

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
use the same terms that doctors actually

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
use rather than what a computer

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
scientist would like to use

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
and then have it such that it's touch

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
friendly because

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,800
you don't want to be really switching

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,960
over to a keyboard and mouse

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
each time you want to look up something

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,240
and the best solution that i found was

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
actually using what's called a resistive

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,360
display which is different from

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
capacitive

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
and i'll go more over the details pretty

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,360
soon

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,199
so just go over the technology stack

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
really quickly

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,360
um my main target is of course linux i'm

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
using kumbuntu

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,199
for most of my testing i'm abusing git

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,120
and pgp to make something that's very

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,160
similar to a blockchain it's not really

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,639
a blockchain but

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
it has a lot of the same ideas as a

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,919
blockchain

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,720
um deep speech i'm trying to use as much

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,080
um

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
existing open source projects as

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,759
possible so this is for if you want to

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,720
do something that's voice activated

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,919
cryofs is mostly for encryption so all

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
the actual patient

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,080
uh data is going to be stored using

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,000
cryfs

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,000
i made a module called clear dental

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,199
backend which has all the c

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,400
plus plus and then i'm using qml and

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
quick controls

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,639
to access whatever need from backend to

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,680
create the interface and each module

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,680
has its own ui for whatever use case

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
that you're doing

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,800
so just to give you an example of how it

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,759
looks like this is the pediatric exam

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,960
so you can see here that because i'm

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
treating a kid

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
you don't see any options for let's say

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
placing an implant because that would

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
make

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
zero sense why give the doctor options

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
that

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
are nonsensical and why don't you just

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,400
actually put

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,560
something that would not only make sense

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,759
but you want to remind the doctor to do

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
like for example

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
okay the kid presented with his mother

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,520
with his father

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
somebody else what's the chief complaint

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,639
these are all missing in current uh

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,240
dental ehrs

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,919
and then integrate the medical history

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,120
so i want to be able to check the vitals

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,039
on each uh

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
appointments be able to do any kind of

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,440
screenings i need to do before i start

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,599
my procedure

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,919
similar idea i'm actually going to uh

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,440
demo the extraction

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,240
uh portion so um the idea is that you

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,720
want to show

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
what is relevant to whatever procedure

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,160
that you're trying to do

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,960
and speaking of that it's going a little

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
slow right now

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
come on

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
oh

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,759
one second sorry okay so just to go over

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
the um actual user interface the reason

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
why

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,800
i'm stressing so much on touch is

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
because

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,080
as i'm treating my patient i always have

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
something on my hands

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
on my right side is the explorer and the

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
left side is the mirror

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
and it's a real big pain to have to put

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,879
them down on the tray

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
do something get my instruments back up

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,280
again

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,360
and then go back to the mouth it would

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,639
be really nice to actually use the same

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
instruments that i'm using on the

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,280
patient

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,800
onto the touchscreen of course i can

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,479
wipe it down with cavicide

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
between each patient but it will be

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
really nice and much more efficient

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,520
to use the very same tools i'm using to

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,319
treat the patient

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,319
to interact with the user interface

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
so here's the mirroring explorer again

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,479
um

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,120
when you're using a resistive touch

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,279
display it you need a

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
certain amount of oomph to actually be

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,600
able to register

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,640
any kind of click this will bend and

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
probably break

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,320
same thing with the periodontal probe

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,160
mirror you don't really want to

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,640
tap using glass so the best

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,080
solution is actually using the blunt

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,160
side of the mirror

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
so essentially use it as a stylus

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:12,240
okay now i am going to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
share my entire screen hopefully people

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
can

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
see it

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
okay

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,399
all right so i'm just going to go over

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,160
the this demo really quickly so

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
as a dentist you're going patient to

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,640
patient really really fast

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
you don't want to make any mistakes but

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,680
sometimes

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
mistakes do happen there's sometimes

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
small mistakes sometimes it's big

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,200
mistake

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
but any kind of mistake it's not really

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,640
all that acceptable so

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,640
here you're in a use case where you're

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,800
about to do an extraction

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
and before you want to extract well you

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
probably want to patient to consent

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
so you have the sign for consent they

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
can use their own finger or whatnot

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,720
to do the consent okay it's now signed

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
um this is new feature that i recently

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,839
added in for kova 19 because

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
you should probably screen your patients

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,760
before you

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
actually treat them last thing you want

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,959
is to

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,360
have an outbreak because you treated the

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,360
patient

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,720
for all patients especially for

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,200
something like an extraction

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,120
you want to take the vitals so if you

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,519
have a patient that has a blood pressure

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,839
190 over 99

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,640
you probably shouldn't be treating that

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200
patient

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,519
and it's also good to see how much pain

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,240
the patient is when they first come into

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,760
your office for the day and then of

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
course if you want to review the medical

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
history there should be a

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,519
really quick and easy way to do so so

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
you can say okay let's talk about your

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
diabetes okay

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
a1c 6.5 that's fine with me are there

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,279
any changes

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,440
i have a dedicated button just to say no

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,519
changes because that's the most common

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
um result when you ask them hey has

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,160
there been any changes to medical

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
history they'll say no

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,200
um because i'm using fake data here this

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
is all just

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,320
some random images but this would be

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
what's called the perry apical

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
radiograph and then this would be the

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,360
bitewing

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,480
so it only would show the radiographs

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
that are relevant

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
to the actual extraction that you're

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
trying to do rather than show you a

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,839
bunch of bitewings and pas that are not

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
relevant for this particular tooth so it

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,560
wouldn't show a pa of tooth number 14

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
because

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,040
hey i'm working on tooth number three

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,040
for local anesthetics um the way that

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
most dentists are actually doing it is

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,360
they just every time they use a car peel

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,040
they would put the empty car pull in a

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
certain area on their dish

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
so at the very end of the procedure they

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,240
would just count up

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,200
the number of carpets that they use so

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
okay there's

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
two reds there's one of the golden ones

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,440
so i must have used

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
two lidocaines one separate cane and if

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
the assistant actually

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,639
put them away before the doctor could

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
write that down then the doctor has to

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,519
rely on their own memory which is not

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
always the best

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,959
so the best way to do it is actually use

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,519
the computer

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,279
to actually keep track of how many local

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,519
assets you've used so

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,360
in this case i'll probably use one for

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,279
actually for number three i would just

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
use two septa canes and then

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,800
just use one marking and then for the

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
actual today's

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,240
appointment you can say okay did it

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,920
section to tooth did i do any kind of

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
socket preservation

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,959
and what kind of grafting material

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,680
rather than trying to remember that

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,560
what kind of sutures did it create a

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,720
flap

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,320
and then when you are completing the uh

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
procedure it would automatically

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
generate your case note

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
based on what you wrote down so it'll

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
actually remember

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,079
okay i used two carpules i used one car

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,120
peel of marking it will actually

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,040
record that as you're doing that

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,880
you can even make a new prescription

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,000
yeah that was a pretty infected tooth

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,279
let's do some amoxicillin things like

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,519
that and then you can just

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,120
either sign the case note or work on a

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,880
little bit later because sometimes you

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,240
want to write down some

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,440
something you want to

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,680
um write more about like for example

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,959
during the procedure the patient really

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,519
couldn't open their mouth so you may

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,720
want to put

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
a quick note of christmas this actually

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
would be using the

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,360
kde virtual keyboard i'm right now being

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,079
lazy right now just using keyboard mouse

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,480
um but it's 100 uh touch friendly you

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
can

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,920
write later on write down yes patient

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
had severe christmas during

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,440
today's procedure but patient was able

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,959
to tolerate just fine

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,600
okay let's see

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,920
now let's stop sharing the screen

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
okay

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560
so just to go over the timeline i'm not

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,079
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,639
done with everything with clear dental

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,240
um there's still a few small bugs i

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,480
really want to

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,480
drill down and make sure it is

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
completely clean before

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,560
i start using it on real patients

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,000
especially

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
um since i'm going to be doing things

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
like you know taking x-rays on them and

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,959
last thing i want to do

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
is zap them with radiation for no good

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,600
reason

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,800
um so i also am working on

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,639
my own dental practice so this is an

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,880
actual private practice that normal

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,600
people can come in and out

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,440
um i'm right now still at construction

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
phase so i already bought the building

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
they're doing construction literally as

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,920
we speak and then

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,519
um it should be done by middle or

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,639
beginning of december

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,160
and then hopefully by then the software

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,399
should be mostly bug free at this point

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,639
and then essentially i'll be doing two

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,079
things i will be running my practice as

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,360
a normal dentist

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
and i'll be doing what's called leader

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
of design and what i mean by editor of

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,680
design

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,839
is uh my practice is going to be open

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
friday saturday and sunday mostly

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
because the

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,399
those are the times that my competition

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,440
will be closed so it's nice days

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,440
to keep that open um monday through

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
thursday is going to be the days that i

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
will

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
learn from all the mistakes software

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,920
mistakes

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,680
um friday saturday and sunday use that

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,720
to improve the software

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,199
and then use it again on friday so

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,079
it's this kind of like cyclic design

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,240
that

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,440
um would use it to essentially make it

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
perfect

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,600
well that's really the goal to make the

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,440
right kind of dental software

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
i'm going to go really quickly over some

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,519
of the mistakes

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,240
that i've made hopefully other people

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,720
will avoid it

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,519
the first one is actually making videos

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
of

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,440
the clear out dental doing demo videos

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
it turns out that

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,199
when you talk to other doctors it

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,480
doesn't really make any sense

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,959
you need to actually

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
show them with a real patient how it

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,600
integrates of your office because you

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
have to remember

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
most doctors keep the computer at the

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,160
side at the corner there

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,199
where it does its own thing so they

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,519
can't really see

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,360
how computers can be integrated with the

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,079
procedure itself how can

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
really help them so until you're

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,240
actually starting to use the real

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
patients

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,279
it wasn't actually that useful to show

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
any kind of video

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,279
so the other mistake that i made was

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
making my own new patient form that was

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,000
customizable

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,959
um the mistake here was thinking that

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,440
doctors could make their own new patient

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,279
form customized for their own practice

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
but then i took a spear ce course and

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,959
realized the way i was

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,560
handling this was completely the wrong

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,600
way and

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,639
you know me thinking okay i know qml

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,480
i know you know how to use cute

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,680
cute supports webassembly why don't i

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
just write it in

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,320
qml and i'll put it to webassembly this

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,440
was about a year and a half ago

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,920
of course um i knew back then that

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,279
mobile support was kind of poor and

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
there were a lot of other issues with

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,880
safari and ios

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
and i thought that it would be improving

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,720
by then but it's been a good year and a

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,880
half now and nothing has really

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,520
changed so i had to rewrite it once

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,319
again

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,600
in bootstrap so i wrote an html slash

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
bootstrap with a little bit of

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,120
javascript

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,799
to do almost the same exact thing it was

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,400
very depressing to have to

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,919
rewrite it all over again um

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,520
very very long story short if you are

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:37,120
doing um a

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,720
sub modules so in cute creator you have

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,400
the option to do sub modules

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,919
i'm starting off some sub dears i meant

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
to say sub dears

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,000
in which you have different projects

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,120
that loan is fine

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
but then when you create each actual qml

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,679
application

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,320
it will encourage you to call it

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,799
main.qml

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,000
which can cause some issues in that

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,360
whenever you are

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,919
trying to debug something cute creator

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,640
will be like okay which main.qml are you

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,640
talking about

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,880
and um without spending two

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,679
without spending too much time on this i

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
learned the hard way that i should

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,320
probably not be using a c

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
plus class for every specific dot json

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,400
project

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,720
i'm sorry dot json file

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,919
um i'll go a little more about that a

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
little bit later

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,919
another issue that i learned the hard

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,200
way is

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
um type coercion so you can see this is

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
a

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,360
json file so here tooth is an integer

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,320
here tooth is an integer here tooth is a

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
string

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,799
so you're thinking okay why do i have a

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,600
string three

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,080
well that's because it could be a normal

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
string

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,240
and sometimes it could be number it

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
could be a letter um so

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
permanent detection actually means

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
adults tooth primary dentition is a baby

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
tooth

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
um which makes it really confusing

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
because you actually hear pediatric

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,440
dentists say

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,440
yes it is tooth number c and you're like

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,160
tooth number c okay

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,200
but that's how they actually say things

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,640
but at the same time

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,039
i like to use go ahead kind of out of

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,760
time

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,039
so if you can wrap up so that we still

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,480
have time for one or two questions that

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,679
would be awesome

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,760
okay so yeah i learned a hard way that

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,840
i should probably just disable the check

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,120
for m126

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,200
um thinking that i should um target

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,320
raspberry pi wasn't a good idea because

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
it's a drop in buckets

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,240
um i did not put yeah i have to go about

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,320
this

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,440
that's a long explanation but yeah

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,960
internationalization

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
all doctors speak english trying to

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,960
convert it to any other language would

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,080
make more problems than solve anything

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,520
and um i'll skip these suggestions and

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,919
go straight to questions sorry it took

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
so long

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,880
this was super awesome i think it was

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
really

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,640
awesome to see completely new world so

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
uh yeah

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,760
there are some questions so i guess i'll

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,919
read them for you uh

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
thank you for joining academy and giving

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,000
us a new perspective

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,440
the first question is have you heard of

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
the new health project

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,200
and would you consider bringing your

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,960
project into their projects

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,120
and working together it's an hms

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,280
system that also has a veterinary

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,720
veterinarian

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,720
module lewis has a talk on that tomorrow

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,480
yeah i actually didn't know too much

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,120
about that particular project

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,919
um there are a couple fundamental

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,159
differences

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,520
between my project and the gnu health in

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
particular

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
mine is trying to be more touch oriented

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,400
of qml

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,000
however and also the way that the

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,880
database is being stored is

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,880
fairly different now not to say that we

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,360
can't have any kind of overlap

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,039
but it's something we can probably share

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
some code it won't be

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
able to be merged i don't think so

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,159
honestly but

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,919
it's a good thing that we can probably

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
say okay insurance

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,120
for this kind of module we need this

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
kind of api

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
and have some common code but i don't

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,880
see a

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,559
um complete merge of those two projects

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
well maybe you can have a chat during

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,600
academy all right we can take two more

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,280
questions maybe

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,520
uh so if the reason for bad old software

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,640
in the field is that vendors maintain

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,919
direct relationship with doctors how can

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,760
this project

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,760
connect to the audience and get more

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,799
deployments

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,919
um yes so henley shine and patterson

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,200
have basically doctors more or less

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,799
you know right at their right hand so

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,039
i mean i don't have a real i guess

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,280
financial model on how to make money off

00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,240
of this and how to distribute

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,000
um basically outside of word of mouth

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,080
hoping that doctors would convert but

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,039
it's not that easy to

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,520
make doctors care about open source i

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
mean

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,640
people already have trouble convincing

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,200
people in i.t to convert to open source

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,240
for doctors it's a hundred times more

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,400
complicated and

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,360
much more difficult to explain why

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,159
should they care

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
about having full control over their

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
patient files

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
all right last question we'll take a kd

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,840
question there some more but uh

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,720
are you using any kde frameworks uh

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,919
any of the libraries and if other

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,039
technical

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,280
troubles why not or are you

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
so i i don't know if you want to

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,840
consider

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,360
kirigami to be an actual kitty framework

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,320
but i was going to use that initially

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,919
but one of the problems i had was there

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,799
were a lot of different panels that i

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,880
wanted to

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,400
customize and kirigami was getting a

00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,919
little bit more in my way

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,840
um one of the recommendations i had in

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,720
my last slide was okay

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,280
i think kitty should start promoting qml

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
as

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,120
more of a first class citizen still

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,640
everything is c plus plus q widget

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,240
based and it would be really nice if

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,640
kde for kdd6 to say okay the official

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,120
way

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,240
is to use this api everybody needs to

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,760
start converting

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,840
that way we have one single way to do

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,720
things i mean kirigami doesn't even

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,520
i don't want to say they're like a side

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,520
project but

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:37,840
it doesn't feel like it's the official

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,840
way of doing things quite yet

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
