Title: Akademy 2020 - Tej Shah - Clear Dental
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The presentation will go over the scope, basic design, history, current status and the future of Clear.Dental. This presentation will also go over some of the major hurdles in using Linux and FLOSS in a clinical environment and recommendations to other people trying to move EHR to a more FLOSS friendly environment. I will probably also end the presentation with recommendation to the KDE team for features that would be very useful in a dental clinic.
