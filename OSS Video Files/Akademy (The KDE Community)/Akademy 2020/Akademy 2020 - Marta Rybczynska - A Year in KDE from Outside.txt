Title: Akademy 2020 - Marta Rybczynska - A Year in KDE from Outside
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	Most of KDE people know KDE news from KDE people. But what are the people outside of the community saying? What are you talking about? Let's explore what non-KDE news sites, blogs and podcasts were saying about KDE.

In this talk we'll cover news coverage of KDE in 2019-20 by sites not linked to KDE. We'll show if KWin on Wayland gets more coverage than KDE goals, what is the hottest subject right now, and much more. With some surprises this analysis prepares...

[Music]

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,600
hello baby

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:21,199
thank you thank you everyone for coming

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,840
what is happening kde it looks like a

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,960
very simple question

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,960
but try to ask five different people

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,320
and i'm wondering uh what kind of

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
answers you're going to get

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
doing a small experiment you are going

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,879
to find

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,879
very very different answers

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,760
much depending on which kind of social

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,120
media of

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,039
or new sites those people are using

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:57,520
an idea for this talk came to me

00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,800
as i started to read

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,120
a little less of kde

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
developers blog and a little more of

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
general

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,799
news because of lack of time to read all

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,840
that is happening

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,000
for the developers in kde

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,680
then i realized that depending

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,040
on the new source i get a completely

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
different view of kd

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,439
so

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,320
as of someone with a research

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:38,240
background let's do some research

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,840
when we start research we define the

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
observation time period

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,119
from academy to academy from september

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,200
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,479
to august 2020 so

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,439
what were the important kde events

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
during the time

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,240
please use the chat and write down

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,200
what you think was important

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,959
what you find important what you've read

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,239
on the different news sites

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,840
from the academy the academy the academy

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,480
of 2019

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
included

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
of course there were a lot of things

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,319
happening

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,440
and if we just go to the

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,440
official kde news sites we'll find

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,120
the release posts will find developers

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,920
blogs

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
enormous amount of information

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,840
so in the end it is i did

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,000
i assumed that you are reading or

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,120
listening

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,319
a single new source reading a website

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
listening to a podcast my discovery of

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,239
the last year a linux related podcast so

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
i had to cover

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,480
a little bit of that and

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,680
the new sites i have analyzed it's my

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
personal choice

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
the things i read all the things i

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,560
thought

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,840
interesting to tell you about they were

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,599
more i investigated

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:26,560
but i think that we can cover

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:30,560
just a little bit and then you will see

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,840
what what shows up

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
from it

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,239
i decided not to use

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,959
a social media so only new sites

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959
podcasts

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,400
uh and no social media for

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,360
very practical reasons social media is

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
pretty hard

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,000
to grab and analyze and there's a lot of

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,319
boss

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
so it's complicated to work with this

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,879
data

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
and the other

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
the other point was that you are

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,080
probably aware

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
depending of on who you are

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,439
social media gives you different content

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,720
depending of

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,280
all the things you are reading uh other

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
things you like

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,919
for me and from every one of you

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,080
facebook or other social media gifts

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
completely different things so i found

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
that it's not

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,960
very reliable

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,520
to look into yes instagram also

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
as jonathan suggests it also gives

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
different things

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
that can be an idea for some further

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,720
research

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,720
in the future but

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
but for the next one so i can see that

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
there is

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,479
already um there are some ideas

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,520
in the chat we have kd working more in

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,160
on wayland monthly app updates

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
usability productivity several plasma

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,000
releases

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,039
plasma 5 18 lts

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,919
and the kt instagram is probably very

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
influential

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,080
i guess so haven't checked out i guess

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,520
so

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,520
with the nice screenshots

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,120
how i organized the results i present to

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,080
you

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
i start from the sites where i found

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,560
less

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,440
reference to kde and then

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,080
i'm going forward with more and more

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
references

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
so let's get started

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,759
if the only thing you were reading

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:59,280
was tech republic

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,280
you will learn for later about kitty

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,639
in november last year there was an

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,600
interview with fedora project leader

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,240
who was mentioning the kde spin as one

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,280
of the project

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,479
that there is uh

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,240
then in the middle of here we have had

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,960
an article about which

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
linux user interface is best for which

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,880
kind

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,520
of um what type of audience

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,520
and they decided that the plasma is the

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,199
best for admins

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
and there was one article about

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,600
distribution-specific

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,199
laptops and in the featured slim book

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,280
for example and then quite recently

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,720
there was one article with the title

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
i'm still not switching for no

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,080
talking about new features of the kd

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:02,479
still but with a conclusion as you can

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,599
as you can probably imagine so

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,800
not very much nothing probably from the

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:13,440
list i have written in the chat

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,440
let's go forward to another site

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,280
linux weekly news that's

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:25,680
a little bit more complex it's a more

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:29,280
linux a lot of kernel in-depth articles

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,800
and what do we find here

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,800
not in 2019

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,240
but in 2020 it starts

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,160
to appear more we have a point about the

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,680
plasma big string

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,520
we have a point about the

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,759
cute licensing uh linking to the

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,280
famous post or on the kde community

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
mailing list

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,479
about the issues between the cute

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,520
foundation

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,560
and kd i guess that probably everyone

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,720
is a little bit aware of that story

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,720
and we also do have

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,319
a pretty big covering of caden life

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,759
and two versions so we have 2004

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,960
and we have 2008

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
later in the year we have the release of

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,440
plasma 5

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,919
19 but not 5 18

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,919
and we have the digicam um

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
release also so you can probably see

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,880
that we have

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:45,279
the big the big releases

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,279
we have some preferred applications here

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,080
for some for some a little bit

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,120
surprising finally

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,040
and the

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:06,000
very big important open source

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,000
facing issue of the sensing of of cute

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,000
now we are moving forward

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,000
and we'll change

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,640
the place and the way of

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,360
accessing the media linux unblocked

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,160
it's a one of very popular linux plaque

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,800
linux

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
podcasts

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,519
getting out every week from my point of

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
view

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,640
very much distribution oriented and very

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
much

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,120
user oriented they invite

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,399
developers but they they are very much

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,839
oriented to the end user

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,440
how the sysadmins and advanced linux

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,920
user

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
can configure and work with their

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
systems

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
and we have

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,080
even more kde stuff

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,560
i would probably start with

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,440
the plus going a little bit mixed

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,160
uh in the time because the chronologica

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
that

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,959
coming in time here maybe a little bit

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,200
complicated we have the plasma releases

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,860
5 17 5 and 10

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,680
we have the

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,800
[Music]

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,920
mangero with plasma that gets reviewed

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,120
we have the review

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,600
in general of plasma different points of

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,120
view

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:50,560
on plasma in the district review episode

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,720
and um we do have

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
a little bit of hardware we have the

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,760
kubuntu focus

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,800
we have the manjaro kde on pinbook

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,160
and what's interesting we do have the

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,160
them covering the neon based on

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,160
the latest ubuntu 204.

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,920
from the things that are less known

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
on the other sides um i would like to

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,600
know

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,000
uh to point out that they

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,160
have mentioned the fact that kd was

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
looking for a project manager

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
that's one one of the episodes when the

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,560
search

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,720
was in progress they were talking about

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
it

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
and now

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,519
something that i couldn't put on the

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,399
timeline because there was a little bit

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
too much of it

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,839
on foreonix you basically have an

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
article

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,160
every three to four days

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,639
when i look at just the kd summaries

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,920
page there were four pages for the

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,920
uh for the year

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,000
what we do have being covered

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,440
every time it shows up is the nate's

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,720
blog post the week in kde

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,399
which is summarized on the site

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,360
every single week

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,279
and we do have the plasma mobile weekly

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
when it was published it was also

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,200
summarized

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,200
on the site

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,639
now they are covering also a lot of kde

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,000
releases

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,800
quite obviously

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
there are all of the plasma releases the

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,560
framework releases

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,560
and the kde applications

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:59,040
us as a blog but they also cover

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:03,519
the big the big applications like

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:06,639
digicam can develop canon live krita

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,600
better surprisingly also

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,160
some of those that are a little bit i

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,519
think

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,560
less popular like the trendy desktop

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,760
camera online that went

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,440
and they

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:27,120
also covered the keween ft

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,800
uh fork for those who missed it

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
uh because they were reading all the

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,279
sites

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,959
uh that is the fork to work um

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:40,160
to make kiwi better on weyland

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,440
and that got covered multiple times you

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,040
probably noticed it

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
also on the awn net that was also

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,519
mentioned

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but only once first

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,000
part

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,079
and the second word they are also

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,519
covering the developers blog posts

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,800
i listed a few names

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,560
that got covered

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,839
and there were some various posts

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,680
about the conference presentations about

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
hardware i found a point about kubuntu

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
focus

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,440
a few of them but i didn't find anything

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,639
about slim book

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,279
they covered the gitlab migration they

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,240
covered the big screen initiative

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,360
and they had an article about the kde

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,519
events

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,519
in december summarizing the whole year

00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,519
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:50,800
and now a few takeaways

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,800
from the whole from the whole thing

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,839
i was looking what the news sites do

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
pick up

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
and i found out that there is a

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,279
different kb year

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,160
on each of those and there's no covet

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,880
if you look at kde there's absolutely no

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,040
covet

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,160
in there the releases

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,360
they matter maybe not

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,680
all of them but they get covered

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,720
good release documentation materials

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,240
related to the wrist they do

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,279
happen they do make difference

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,000
and they will get get taken

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,639
by the new site plasma definitely is a

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
thing

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,240
but also the big applications the big

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
popular application

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
in this year what got covered on the

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,519
hardware side

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,560
were laptops no phones what's

00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,000
whatsoever didn't find anything

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,759
about kdeon phones this year

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,959
and that's probably

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,920
understandable for most of you

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,959
the big changes happening the project be

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,360
them

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,480
good or bad like licensing

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,839
changes or licensing issues

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,160
like the concepts happening in the

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,600
project

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,600
like fox

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:37,839
if they happen they have a big chance

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,839
to be taken by the news sites

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,720
my suggestions for people working on

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:51,839
projects if you want

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
to get covered what you can do

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,399
weekly news from projects communities

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,399
and applications

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,880
that's something that gets read

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,280
and maybe not every single time but from

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,280
from time to time the information

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,000
goes out and is covered

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,000
detailed blog posts for example about

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,679
the design decisions be

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,720
behind the big changes and the

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,199
modifications that

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,160
are very much visible to the user

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,160
that's something that if you write a

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,720
blog post about it

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:39,039
it can become become popular

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:44,400
and transmitted by the by the innocents

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:48,160
i also think i can even bet to that

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,440
if someone starts writing what is new in

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,760
plasma or kde in

00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:00,000
a given distribution in the new version

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,760
that is likely to get covered

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
definitely the changes in kde happen at

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
some point

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
but the moment when it shows up in the

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
distribution

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
it's a different moment of time many

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,120
people will be

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,600
interested in knowing that

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,080
some of those changes did come to the

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,080
distribution right now

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:28,400
hardware running kde last point

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,600
that is definitely interesting to people

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
and if you write about hardware running

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,080
on kde

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:40,080
pink laptops be it phones beat

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
watches or whatever you can find

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,320
i would say it's going to be covered

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,520
before we wrap up and we go to the

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,000
questions

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,320
a little bit a footnote about the data

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
analysis

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,559
as a developer i wanted to automate

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,080
things so

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,400
i will grab the erythesa recession

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,400
but

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,559
the number of keywords related to kde

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,799
is big because we have to cover

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,520
kd we have to cover plasma we have to

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,880
cover

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,480
all of the biggest applications

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,160
and the feeds do not cover the whole

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,679
year but that's probably i can work

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,559
around

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,360
on the other hand there's the abstract

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,640
of the news

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,160
and there is the news itself

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,039
for some sites the kde is not even in

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
the abstract

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
it is in the content of the article so

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,039
you

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,400
have to look for desktop review for

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,000
distribution review

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,120
and then look into the article itself

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,160
to find out if the kde is covered in

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
there

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,640
so finally most of the analysis was done

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,480
manually not all of it

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,679
if you know about the tools i'm

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,159
interested

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,559
and i'm also wondering that with all of

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,679
those keywords maybe i can

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
do some artificial intelligence next

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,960
time

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,559
for the next analysis that may be

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,760
interesting

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:21,840
interesting experience and now

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
we'll go to the questions

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,080
it was a great talk martha thank you

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,320
so uh yeah we have a question

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,919
the monthly app updates don't tend to

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,679
get many pointers

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,679
isn't that a problem in the format

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,320
ah a good question um

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,810
i'm not sure why it gets no

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
uh no updates um

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,590
[Music]

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,440
no uh no news um

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,640
[Music]

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,039
i can i can look into that maybe there

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,360
is

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:09,520
some some issue with the referencing

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,320
i would say that it's definitely

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,080
something that has a potential

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,520
to be heavily linked and i can

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:23,200
i can look into that and uh

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,320
try to suggest what what you can do to

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
to make it more popular

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,120
okay great one more question

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
can you come to promo and help us out

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,080
there

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,200
we collect a lot of data but could us

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,960
could use your

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,919
advice yeah yeah definitely

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,240
that's something i would i would do soon

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,159
um

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,320
[Music]

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
coming back a little bit more in the

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,039
development

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,799
and in the in the data analysis

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,360
definitely i can help the promo team

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,400
with with that

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,320
okay uh we have another question

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
there is a link uh which you will be

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,280

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,640
note of the link

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,520
i wasn't aware so i'm taking it

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
differently

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
something not to look into for me yeah

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,240
and

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,880
one person is asking any good podcast

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880
you looked at

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,679
depending what we are searching for

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,520
there are a lot of linux podcasts out

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,960
there

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,360
and depending on what kind of content

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,440
you are looking for

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,840
if it's more of an admin user

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
linux unplugged for that it's a very

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
good

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,559
uh there are podcasts about new people

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,679
coming to

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:05,120
linux um about more beginner stuff

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,520
um i can probably come with some names

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,640

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,280
uh you search in your favorite
