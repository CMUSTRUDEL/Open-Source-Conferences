Description: 
	Story of Janayugom, the first newspaper in the world to use 100% free software for pre-press processes and how KDE played an important role in it.

Janayugom is a local daily newspaper in Kerala with 100k readers. In a time where press freedom is under threat, local newspapers are struggling to survive. The increasing subscription cost of various proprietary software adds even more burden. This presentation is about how free software came to their rescue and how KDE & Plasma Desktop helped in the migration. It also includes the story of Scribus and Janayugom Edit - a Qt based ASCII to Unicode converter and text editor.
