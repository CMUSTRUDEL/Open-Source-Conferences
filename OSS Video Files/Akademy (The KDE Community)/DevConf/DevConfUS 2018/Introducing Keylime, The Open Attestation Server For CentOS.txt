Title: Introducing Keylime, The Open Attestation Server For CentOS
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	A tenant who hosts its security-sensitive data in today's cloud has limited ability to verify the underlying cloud platform.
Keylime, a scalable, trusted cloud key management system, provides an end-to-end solution for both bootstrapping hardware rooted cryptographic identities for IaaS nodes and system integrity monitoring of those nodes via periodic attestation.
We will present how we are importing this critical system into RHEL based Linux. Using Keylime, a RHEL using tenant can ensure its cloud node is not compromised. This guarantee includes the node's firmware, tenant's operating system, and its applications.
