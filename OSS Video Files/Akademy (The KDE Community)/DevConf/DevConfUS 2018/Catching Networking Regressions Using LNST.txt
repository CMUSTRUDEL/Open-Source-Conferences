Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	The evolution of networking speed and technology is remarkably increasing. This brings up the need of continuous testing to detect issues when they first rise.
Linux Network Stack Test (LNST) is a powerful tool to test multiple topologies and protocols including virtualization, tunneling, security and much more.
In this presentation you will learn:
The LNST framework and its test topology.
How to setup an LNST test.
How to write an LNST test case via examples of existing test cases.
How to run/execute your LNST test.
Interpreting results and detect regressions.
Upstream activity.

At the end of the presentation you should be equipped with the knowledge of using this framework and writing tests to successfully catch networking regressions.
