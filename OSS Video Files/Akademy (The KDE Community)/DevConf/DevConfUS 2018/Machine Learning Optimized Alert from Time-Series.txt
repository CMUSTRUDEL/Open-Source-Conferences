Title: Machine Learning Optimized Alert from Time-Series
Publication date: 2019-02-21
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Time series data, captured continuously, can be analyzed to detect behavioral patterns, anomalies & and false positive alerts. When an alert is generated, system operator is notified. But if the alert level is not properly set for trends and seasonality of the data, false alert is created.

The talk focuses on how to utilize statistics and various learning algorithms to capture the patterns of time series metric and predict the future values.

Key items- Descriptive stats, Trend & Seasonality analysis, Algorithm explaining, Residual Analysis for prediction accuracy, LSTM for complex pattern fitting, Dynamic Alert levels

Jupyterhub on Openshift is used as dev environment accessing data from Ceph.
