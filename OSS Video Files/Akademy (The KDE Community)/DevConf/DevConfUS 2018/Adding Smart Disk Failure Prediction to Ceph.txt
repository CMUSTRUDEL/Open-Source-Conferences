Title: Adding Smart Disk Failure Prediction to Ceph
Publication date: 2019-02-21
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Ceph is a distributed storage system designed to scale to thousands or tens of thousands of drives. In such systems, failure becomes the norm rather than the exception, and predicting device failures before they happen can significantly improve the overall reliability of the system. This talk will describe a project to make Ceph monitor the storage devices in the cluster, using tools like SMART, so that future failures can be anticipated using a pluggable prediction model, allowing the cluster to reduce the risk of data loss by preemptively warning the operator or migrating data and workload off the failing device. Finally, weâ€™ll discuss the opportunity to build a public data set of device failure data to build a high quality, free and open source model for use it any storage system.
