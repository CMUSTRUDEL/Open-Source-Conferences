hey real-life children YouTube leaves

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,900
the trick questions like that what is in

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,900
these copy

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,440
[Music]

00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,620
think we're ready

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,740
all right we're good together

00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,580
hello everyone good afternoon you guys

00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,320
have made it this far

00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,740
first day of deaf Kampf that's pretty

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,130
good so what we're gonna do today we're

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,980
gonna talk about the impact of AI and we

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,370
have with us Jared Olli in Daniel and

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,440
they will be our panelists I am sure our

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,030
Griffin the moderator I'm here to keep

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,410
these guys honest and make sure that

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,100
they tell you the truth and nothing but

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,440
the truth

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,400
so first off we're gonna do some

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,220
introductions

00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,199
Jared maybe want to kick yourself I'm

00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,990
Jared play there's a microphone I think

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,920
so y'all get a little higher

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:15,190
there we go yeah I'm Jared Floyd I'm the

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:19,250
CTO working on technology strategy work

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,500
also for the CTO Chris rides and no one

00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,180
knows what I'm doing so mostly looking

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,600
at all kinds of compute things among

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,460
them is machine learning

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,370
Danny Rico officers CTO and I am manage

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:37,030
the AIFF excellence of working on

00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:40,060
records AI strategy so we're gonna first

00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,160
start off with a pretty generic question

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,460
to get the ball rolling what do we think

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,940
about the impact of AI as it deals with

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,470
software development IT operations

00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,540
DevOps those types of things so I'm

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,300
curious Daniel what are your thoughts on

00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:02,860
that so well I think that overall AI is

00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,680
transformation and in many of the shiny

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,320
topics that we see in media like

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,179
self-driving cars and all that are like

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,090
hard problems to solve and there are a

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:16,290
lot of low-hanging foods for applying

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,290
machine learning to improve IT itself

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,820
software development operations

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,959
embedding AI capabilities machine

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,370
learning capabilities in software

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,190
products in the platforms and you know

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,019
it see the picture used if you're

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,510
driving a self-driving car and you

00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,140
probably don't want to sysadmin in the

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,660
trunk

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,049
but that that car is basically data

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,390
center on wheels and so in order to get

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,760
that one how to make things to a degree

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,560
beyond what we have done so far is IT

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,430
and I think that applies like generally

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,930
to what we do with software

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,300
Jerald in your line of work what do you

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,310
think the impact of AI will be

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,020
well AI is interesting because it covers

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,380
a lot of traditional analytics as well

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,550
as which key learning techniques and I

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,760
think they'll talk a little bit more

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,830
about this later on but I think that

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,319
there's a very interesting set of

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,900
patterns of newer applications that are

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,090
built around data flows and bringing

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,640
data into the system doing some sort of

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,099
processing in it which may include AI

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
processes and then taking action on that

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,430
and that may be taking action locally or

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,840
that may be taking action at a different

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,580
point so Daniel just talked about

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,459
autonomous driving as an example

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,910
autonomous driving has the full suite of

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,920
AI ml techniques and play but most of

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,260
those aren't happening on the car

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,390
they're happening in a training process

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,830
that's happening

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,080
in a very large data center

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,850
infrastructure so there's flow that's

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,280
happened that's that's occurring where

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,650
data is coming in from vehicles for

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,900
asynchronous training purposes it's

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,150
being analyzed and then that's creating

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,070
updates that that are then delivered

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,860
again asynchronously to the vehicle to

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:05,270
improve its behavior so managing how

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,080
that data flow happens managing the

00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,660
security of that data flow the

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,260
reliability of that overall application

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,520
process the the general assurance that

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,780
it's doing the right thing is going to

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,019
be in for students is that same pattern

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,060
occurs across use cases such as IOT

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,620
Internet of Things another kind of large

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,750
but complex area use cases as well so

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,290
overall I think we're going to see if

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,240
two of these data centric applications

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,750
of which AI is a core component for

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,230
doing analysis

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,930
so when you mentioned about security and

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,390
things like that you see a place in AI -

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:51,200
maybe mitigate the risk for businesses

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:54,120
or at least exposed potential issues I

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,930
think from a security perspective in

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,880
that case I was talking more about

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,280
making sure that you have templates for

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,360
what your application lifecycle is so

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,310
that you know that you've done

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,350
appropriate integration testing you know

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,940
you've done a proprietary testing before

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,770
you put something in what can be a

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,900
safety critical situation

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,580
ai techniques also can apply for

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:21,120
security use cases that Lily just had to

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,790
talk two sessions ago about using AI

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,740
techniques for anomaly detection or

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,480
intrusion detection all the things that

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,390
we've traditionally built rules based

00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,190
systems around but the AI techniques

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,860
allow us to create much more flexible

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,630
much more reactive environments

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,530
[Music]

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:43,880
alright now given that Linux is you know

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,950
the biggest open-source operating system

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,770
what's interesting is there's a lot of

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,080
Linux developers out there now holy can

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,630
you kind of speak to what you think AI

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,960
means to a Linux and a systems developer

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,460
and how that might change their paradigm

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,730
or change their approach to development

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,400
I don't necessarily think it's limited

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,820
to learnings the purpose but there are

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,930
big opportunities when it comes to to

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,860
developing any kind of complex system

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,530
nowadays where we reach the point that

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,030
individual is not actually able to

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,040
understand every single aspect of this

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,660
it's not able to understand the signals

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,300
which the system can actually bring out

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,870
and recognize it has something positive

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,960
or negative or something like this and

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,550
therefore not so even if they're

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,380
sometimes recognized them there might be

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,000
biased in a certain direction that they

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,470
actually don't want to recognize the

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
signal as being something good something

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,690
bad or something in between and so on

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,930
and getting mathematical logic have in

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:52,470
place to to do this kind of work to do

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,630
the analysis of the work will open up

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,480
completely new venues so just to give

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,820
you an example

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,920
that's a couple of I gave earlier today

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,690
a talk on microarchitecture of CPUs and

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,750
sahaan so this is something which I

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,450
would give my foot for the room with 100

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,040
people and suppose that when I probably

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,690
could not hit the single one who

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,580
actually knows anything about these kind

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,010
of things like market architecture this

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,960
is a very esoteric topic but at the same

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,840
time if anyone wants to do performance

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,030
analysis using today's performance

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,190
counters which availability to you you

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,650
cannot do anything without actually

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,500
understanding what they mean so but with

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,180
some rewriting some logic some

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,120
mathematical logic around the analysis

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,370
we can actually learn what makes up what

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,980
measurements actually describe a good

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,870
workload as opposed to a backward flow

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,240
than half the AI actually learned this

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,250
kind of things without the user actually

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,120
able to describe what makes it good or

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,340
bad so we can learn from the systems

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,340
directly and circumvent the lack of

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,960
understanding which the which the user

00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,600
might not have what a program might not

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,050
have and this is a turn beyond just

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Linux work so it's for everyone some a

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,890
big advantage going forward we just have

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:14,240
to build these kind of systems okay but

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:17,450
I think this it's a general pattern that

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,300
we can use a high for the census of

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,250
password to derive knowledge directly

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,830
from data we have the ability to

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:29,330
generate a whole lot of data now the

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,229
complexity of our systems are beyond the

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,599
capability of humans to understand and

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:38,020
AI can help us make sense of things or

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,910
really can autonomously derive

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:44,090
meaningful information from this very

00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:46,130
complex set of vectors and the amount of

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,990
data righted so the problems the data is

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,589
it's it's

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,399
the volume but also the complexity of

00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:57,700
data that just beyond like what anyone

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,430
can still grasp there's a human you just

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,790
have a limit on how how many vectors can

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,740
you consider and try to understand what

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,040
this like what's the root cause for a

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,899
problem and the machine can help us and

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,270
the other aspect is that something which

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,880
has been working also is some of the

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,709
tasks are mundane this is and therefore

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,970
programmers are not likely to take them

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,420
up voluntarily

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,070
monitoring a CI system of some sort or

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,140
recognizing very simple faults like well

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,570
yeah you didn't commit this message is

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,410
this his check in here and sound it's

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,830
missing something

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,420
so this is done and to show up can talk

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,520
about this as well cities and countries

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,209
into our keys and parts oftentimes in

00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,800
some form where simple tasks might not

00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:43,959
be even have to be handled by humans

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,060
anymore and therefore we get much more

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,520
reliable systems because these kind of

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,100
mistakes if they pop up can be very

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,810
quickly rectified

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,970
so with the automate sounds like a

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,100
little bit of the you know removing the

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,589
manual tasks that a person might have to

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,630
do I do have you guys experienced any of

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,850
those examples of things maybe we're

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,070
doing in Red Hat in that space or other

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,430
tools where you've seen a good job of it

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,320
eliminating that manual mundane tasks

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,930
[Music]

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,000
absolutely interacted just I don't know

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,940
the project or product but I've

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,140
interacted on github projects where I

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,089
reported bugs and immediately had a

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,890
button I'm back with you might find

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,730
these other ones relevant and it's a

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,380
very simple conceptual piece of code but

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,380
actually having a produce useful results

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,610
was enormously helpful and yeah we have

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:42,180
examples like that that we're in the

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:46,110
flake analysis and CI for example where

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:49,860
you it tells you if there's like

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,770
somewhere deep in the many aspect of

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,200
like our system can fail they look they

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,170
look random to a human observer because

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,150
you don't see the depths of you know it

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,820
was like on a full moon and was

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:07,160
something someone tortured black

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,380
schrödinger's kept on the graveyard

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,120
you don't you don't know that but but

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,400
it's somewhere in the log and it's in

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,190
the metrics of the cluster where you run

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,770
around your test and after it happened

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,570
five times you know there's a pattern

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,570
there because somewhere deep in the

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,240
vectors of the of the data

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,950
it's a clustering of issues and so the

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,510
system can identify that that's actually

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,340
not the flakes there is a problem

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,500
somewhere hidden deep in the code that

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,540
as a human it just doesn't happen often

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,220
enough or it's too hard to understand

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,030
what happens and we we have that today

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:47,029
it's improving our quality as we speak

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:47,029
[Music]

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,960
this is actually an interesting thing

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,360
where we need some work but a lot of

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,150
research going on most of the works in

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,060
machinery nowadays built on law of large

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,170
numbers where you need statistics to

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,950
actually count your development

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,960
yourselves so what is going on to some

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,300
extent nowadays simple B hopefully the

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,790
focus of more work is that we actually

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,320
can work with very small data sets and

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,010
device patterns out of that in a

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,280
reliable way

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:21,140
so the thing which daniel mentioned that

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,050
you might get to the same error

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,730
situation five times in the sixth time

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,620
we can actually introduce something

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,220
about this ahead of time that's very

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,920
very useful and we're trying to do some

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,540
some work in that area so my personnel

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,080
help on that kind of thing to do the

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,370
math for me and

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,940
looking forward to actually getting

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,800
results in that area Jared I want to go

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,920
back to something Daniel mentioned

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,930
earlier and that was part of his

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,870
presentation earlier about data being

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,940
the differentiator you know having all

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,769
of this information all of this data the

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,110
way you use it how you make it available

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:03,160
both internally and externally to your

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,600
team so how do you see with data being

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,310
the differentiator what does that mean

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,190
in the AI space and then how does that

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,019
impact AI in general oh that's a very

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,220
interesting question I hopefully can

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:15,970
give an answer that won't get me into

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,910
trouble so one thing that's very

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,310
important about not just AI but AI is

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,140
really driving this is driving value

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,240
further out of the stack we've already

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,769
driven value from lower level software

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,310
to higher level application

00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:33,000
infrastructures what AI techniques do is

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:36,160
that they drive value from your AI

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,490
infrastructure to the data to the models

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,920
that you're building with that

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,829
and so this can be very yeah very

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,379
challenging because you can ship

00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,970
software that's open source software

00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:48,619
which is fully capable of solving a

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,240
particular problem that may even have

00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,860
the books you know the input and a

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,689
propose to solve a particular problem

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,699
but if you don't ship that with a

00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:57,829
working model then the software itself

00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:00,769
is useless if you don't ship it with the

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:02,779
data to train that model then then

00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:05,119
you'll be limited potentially in what

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,730
what an open source user could do to

00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:09,499
enhance that

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,779
similarly shipping a model in and of

00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:14,990
itself can be challenging because it

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,550
depends on what data has been used to

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,059
train that model that if that's

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,920
confidential proprietary data your model

00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,540
can potentially leak information that

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,059
you don't want to be leaving so I think

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,170
that as ml grows in importance in the

00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,100
open

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,380
they're going to be some very

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,060
interesting conversations about what

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,579
license to make these models available

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,769
under what about the data sets do we

00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:38,389
have over the repositories for the data

00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:42,889
sets and the models that are training

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:44,870
these newly critical systems and a lot

00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,630
of discussions that we had many years

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,920
ago around licensing and software we're

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,949
going to have to have those same

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,310
conversations again as it comes to the

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:58,550
data and the models in base products

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,829
that certainly there are data licenses

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,660
that exist there are content licenses

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,089
that exist they may or may not be

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,240
appropriate for these particular types

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,089
of data or it may not be

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,940
nuanced enough to describe the variants

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,700
and places that we may want to let up

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,520
that's interesting Daniel what are your

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,470
thoughts about the difference between

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,260
open-source data and these closed off

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,810
blackbox systems obviously you have

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,400
someone like an Amazon or Google where

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,500
they've collected all of their own data

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,480
therefore they have the power with their

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,920
own algorithms but as you mentioned

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,330
earlier that's a little bit different

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,460
with open source can you kind of dive

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:41,080
into that a little bit more two sites I

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,170
think that for a lot of things where

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,960
we're going to use AI we need open

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,370
source even more than we needed with the

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,580
queue service so they think the

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,380
difference is that traditionally we have

00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:59,050
it's all about code right we're in a

00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:01,600
quick code centric the source code is

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,380
complete and describes functionality of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,180
the software with ml suddenly you need

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,220
today to describe the full functional of

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,810
the training data to describe the full

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,730
functionality and depending on what

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:17,680
you're doing like that might change like

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:21,400
when you were running the software the

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,790
one problem is that if you know if you

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,980
have a machine that derives information

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,460
draws conclusions directly from data

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,160
takes takes action based on that there

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:37,450
is no human in between anymore I think

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,580
that even more drives the need for

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,490
transparency that that of the open

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,080
source can provide it so that's one

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,440
aspect of this

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,910
trusting a black box service is getting

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,250
harder and harder a more like more

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,440
knowledge or intelligence sign that it's

00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,779
like in there's more intelligences and

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,040
is in that service and then on the other

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:06,709
hand we have I think what Jared said and

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,170
i curious what all these perspective is

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:14,360
on that you know when you open source

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:18,290
versus AI and and like how do we keep

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:21,439
that consistent rich kind of it comes

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,809
with firmware blobs which are opaque

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,179
binary data that's necessary to have a

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,280
system operate and I don't think that we

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,130
can stay static with that same level of

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,050
acceptance as ml models become more

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,560
critical two pieces of software that

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,170
were using

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,150
yeah so the the data aspect is certainly

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,810
so it makes up part of the solutions

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,920
that beyond so David Tennant mentioned

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,130
after the implementation the

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,290
implantation is important as well so

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:53,430
that it is actually freely available and

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:55,170
can be inspected because these these the

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,020
software which are built for our

00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:02,540
modeling that's a deep neural network or

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:05,130
other other techniques and so on they

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,990
well why would you trust them actually

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:10,500
to do something so that could be hidden

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,140
somewhere in there if the user is Greek

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,920
then spit out a thousand dollars

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,230
otherwise zero I could hide it in there

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,750
so it has to be in spectacle and this

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,040
also means that for the data itself even

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,470
if the implementation is right and

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,140
someone is delivering the distraint

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,960
model with it it has to be replicatable

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:35,850
so in machine learning really is nothing

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,790
but but the scientific process actually

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,400
put in reality for everyone to use and

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,650
one of the big aspects in science is

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,810
that you have to design an experiment

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,610
and make it with reducible because

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,290
otherwise no one is trusting this and

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,500
the same will now be true for every

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,690
single program out there

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,190
and therefore we have like Jared

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,200
mentioned at some point we have to think

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,659
about how we're delivering models along

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,049
with us but our services provision so

00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:05,059
things like notebooks which have been

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:07,700
available for a long time so

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:10,070
mathematical programs like this add them

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,379
forever and notebooks are going to be

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,720
the way how you actually describe how

00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:17,059
you arrived at the state that your model

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,730
is right now and then people can say oh

00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,909
yeah I see this I can replicate this and

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:27,440
therefore I can entrust the service they

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:29,299
think that the so firmwares is

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,909
compromised the people willing to make

00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:34,730
this hardware is propriety like

00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:37,460
hardware's physical right so it's it's

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,100
somehow an anchor to to something

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,570
proprietary historically we just change

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,549
and right and like I wouldn't say

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,690
firmware trustus so just look at the

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:49,909
Intel's people it's only good people

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,360
dealt with it like we're actively

00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:55,220
working to do away with the stuff so

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,259
we've actually lacked the ability to be

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,669
introspective to part of the hardware

00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,080
that we

00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:03,000
so I think I think Daniel is saying that

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,080
that the firmware is abstracted into the

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,909
same level that I don't decap my CPU and

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,950
use a scanning electron microscope to

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,179
validate that it's doing what it says it

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,510
does there could be all sorts of

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,590
malicious name actually no but I think I

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,750
really get the point where whole

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,299
operating systems are embedded in the

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,779
sea you like and not the best operating

00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:27,630
systems right like I think what is MINIX

00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,100
is obsolete or something was the version

00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,779
which they use worse many versions

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:38,279
behind so at that point I think III

00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:40,440
think you know it's it's probably it's

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,360
it's a bit of different it stifle from

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,120
source hardware and then we're getting

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:50,309
there right now they're working on

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:53,549
Patterson and probably like it's the

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,100
same like the more the more autonomy

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:59,309
machines get the more important this is

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,230
gonna be is because we wanna take over

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:04,140
with the model we have to trust them so

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:10,440
and then that becomes a very fundamental

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:12,419
question for a business for for society

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,000
well I think there's a very related

00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,940
security

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,950
issue that that he raised that goes back

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,920
to the training date of remodels and the

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,020
necessity to have that be reputable in

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,630
an open-source product because one of

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,190
the big challenges with with machine

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,960
learning systems is that

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,520
the ability to be introspective into the

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,030
reasons why they make the decisions they

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,550
do is a much younger area of research

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,850
than the learning model is themselves

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,320
and so to be able to one ask you know on

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,870
what basis where these decisions made

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,510
and also to make sure that there isn't a

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,640
Trojan horse in the model that as as

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,750
Imlay suggested they do the right person

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,160
then you can take all the money out of

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,140
the ATM because

00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,730
deciding what it should give you which

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:04,330
is not a very good use case for all

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,800
right so talked a lot about the hardware

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,030
part of it in the latter part in the

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,590
hardware vs software

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,900
what about software in terms of the data

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,450
versus the source code when we start to

00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,820
talk about the entanglement of needing

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,740
to have enough data for the algorithms

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,210
but then also having to have the right

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,800
algorithms that can analyze the data

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,800
Daniel what are your thoughts on that

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,380
the main thing is their data science

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:39,250
machine learning may I some people call

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,580
it I don't know why it's not something

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:45,190
which you should think you know you can

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,650
apply if you just know that well yeah I

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,320
can all this library and be done so you

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,270
have to think about the model as it is

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,000
produced by a machine learning algorithm

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:57,220
like a function so if you put in good

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,470
data you get good results our parents

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,260
but you put in garbage you'll get a

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,600
garbage out so how do you to be able to

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,340
successfully use any of the machine

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,880
learning techniques you have to be able

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:13,180
to distinguish between the model being

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,920
garbage or not and that's not that easy

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,570
so this is actually something which

00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,190
requires you to understand what the math

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,980
is you know what the weaknesses of the

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,380
various techniques are etc so this is

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,600
not not as easy there will never be

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,300
black boxes where you can say well

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,700
here's my data do something with it and

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,040
in the end well it will work always

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,930
that's never

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,580
to be the case my team and therefore you

00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,390
have to be careful with what you're

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,770
actually doing

00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:46,320
who is actually doing the work and so if

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:49,530
anyone can produce a model but whether

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,660
the model is useful that depends on lots

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,330
of quality factors do you see that as a

00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:58,980
challenge for organizations maybe jeredy

00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:01,350
if you've come across this but companies

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,990
want to move towards AI and ml and they

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,030
implement these but it does seem to

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,480
require quite a bit of work to tune

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,580
fine-tune get the feedback from whatever

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,110
service is being used in and make sure

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,720
that that model is accurate our

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,610
company's prepared for the workload that

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,920
it takes to actually tune these models

00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,570
on an ongoing basis well I think what

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,790
Dooley was getting at was actually just

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,850
a microcosm of software development as a

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,740
whole which is that many businesses are

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,600
very fluid understanding what software

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,010
they want to develop and therefore the

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,210
software that they produce doesn't do

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:37,060
what they want that

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,760
we don't have the ability to open up a

00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,440
text buffer and write a short

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,850
description of what the software should

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,680
do and have us has been automatically

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,740
federated and those will be playing

00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,530
sadly we never will because half of the

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,870
harder part of software or at least a

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,980
large percentage of it is deciding and

00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,160
determining what it's supposed to look

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,570
like in the first place that I'm not

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,610
suggesting that the right way to go

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:04,060
about this is the big design up front

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,010
multi thousand page specifications but

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,450
understanding what problems you're

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,100
trying to solve are critical to

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,590
selecting the tools that you're going to

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,270
use to solve them validating that you're

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,160
solving the correct problems or

00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,360
validating you're solving the problems

00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,650
we've set out to solve and then

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,010
deploying that software so AI nml

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:26,410
techniques are just another set of tools

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,960
in the box we're solving business

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:31,450
problems personal problems

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,640
occasional problems societal problems

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,340
that we want to influence with with

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,169
systems and so in the business framework

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,580
you have to know what your problem is

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,230
before you know what tools to solve it

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,610
you're going to use to solve it and you

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,320
have to know what those tools are

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,929
capable of before you can select them

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,299
and so there's a whole spectrum of tools

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:51,850
for data analysis from traditional

00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:54,340
statistical techniques which is a lot of

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,250
what these these data science workbench

00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,679
products allow you to work with

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,890
the newer m/l techniques where it

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,659
largely comes down to again doing what

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,580
problem you're trying to solve can you

00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,140
clearly define the inputs and the

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,539
outputs that you want out of your

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,700
process whether it's statistical or m/l

00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,169
if you can't then you need to go back

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,760
and figure that out because none of the

00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,750
tools are going to solve the problem for

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,190
you

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,350
and then it's simply a matter of

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:22,860
selecting is this something where when

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,529
looking at the problem can i you can I

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,120
describe what the rules look like you

00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:31,710
know is it that there's a very large

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,740
space of possible input scenarios but I

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:37,559
have a very easy way of describing what

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,200
rules apply for what actions I want to

00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,940
take then neural network isn't the right

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,220
tool necessarily that there are other

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,929
rules based systems that you can use on

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,259
the other hand is really easy for me to

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:51,120
create a huge set of example data that I

00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,629
can feed it to an algorithm where I can

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,129
define very clearly ten or a hundred or

00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:58,110
a thousand parameters from that input

00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:00,059
data set where I've clearly defined what

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,429
outputs I want but it's really hard for

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:04,679
me to describe in relation those inputs

00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:08,629
what rules need to be applied that's

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,629
where more machine learning

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,470
approach makes sense so these are all

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,270
tools that you have and yes lots of

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,559
people are using them wrong and lots of

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:20,730
people are using them because they're

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:24,510
buzzwords you know we can have our ai ai

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:27,000
IOT blockchain talk after this file for

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,910
an IPO for our startup it's going to do

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,860
blockchain neural networks to do that

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,020
was blockchain I think you can do it all

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:40,400
in one that's my understanding I mean

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:40,400
the IPO or I see em I see oh yeah I see

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:48,020
want to exert life afterwards and use

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,270
all the right tools all the wrong way so

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,760
yeah today there's one other everything

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,500
and this is confusing many people who

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,920
don't necessarily have the insight in

00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,290
there so oftentimes people are using

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,480
machine learning especially with deep

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,580
deep learning and deep neural network

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,100
learning mechanisms in what is called

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,410
unsupervised learning situations this is

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,990
the entire business model of likes of

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,940
Google or Facebook etc so they are

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,309
trying to learn in an unsupervised or if

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,900
the massive amounts of data something

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,910
about you they don't actually know about

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,340
what it is they are look just looking at

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,770
similarities of some sort and so on so

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,020
in completely unsupervised ways there's

00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,120
no human doing an intervention so why

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,340
does it work why do I say well this

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,400
doesn't work in general why does it work

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,700
for them the reason is simply that the

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,179
impact of them getting the model wrong

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,720
is that you are seeing an X which you

00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:46,650
don't like

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,630
big whoop who cares if on the other hand

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,000
you are doing these kind of things and

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:53,280
you're writing some piece of software

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,340
which decides whether to shut down the

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,690
cooling a nuclear reactor guess what

00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,940
it's a little bit more important that

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,070
you don't want to have this so there's

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,550
this last respect spectrum of course in

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,560
the middle but I would argue that pretty

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,860
much everyone has to be taken seriously

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:13,470
doesn't have the freedom to just ignore

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,850
the quality of the model so most of the

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,940
time you really want to have something

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:20,190
which is which is really solid in its

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,560
results of my previous life I worked for

00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,660
a financial company and some and there

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,640
they could not do these kind of things

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,650
automatically because the result might

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,080
have been that you're losing a couple of

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,570
hundred million dollars so that's not

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,350
doable it's not just human life and one

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,400
might be at stake

00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:42,510
and therefore I would really argue that

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:45,720
these these nice-looking prospects of

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,720
machine learning which come from the use

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,580
of of unsupervised learning might be

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,530
good for things like marketing is that

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,200
reference during these 10 things but

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,640
pretty much no other area of life where

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,050
you actually depends on who's on

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,460
all right so we're just about out of

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:06,650
time do we have time for any questions

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,410
okay so we'll take a couple of questions

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:13,600
anyone have any questions

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:15,860
sure over there you have another make

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,010
just a second - they're coming with a

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,010
mic

00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:27,149
hi hello I just wanted to know your

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:29,399
views about AI in gaming where they are

00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:36,960
interacts with human constantly and

00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:38,879
there is a lot of criticism in gaming I

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:48,600
wanted to know your views about yeah in

00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:51,539
gaming right I'd have rights my own

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,159
games for a long long line time and but

00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:55,080
we caught the eye back then doesn't

00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,710
really compare to what is this today is

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,379
so that it's up but I think you are

00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:04,019
mostly referring to the opening ions on

00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:05,610
trying to solve games using any isince

00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:07,620
on this this is it's only two different

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,980
things so they're using this mostly

00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,659
because it can be done one a percent

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,909
inside the computer without hiring

00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:17,940
anyone out this is just an example for

00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:19,620
the solution where the input is not a

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,539
binary one zero and so on

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:26,220
it's visual input so in theory so there

00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:29,159
is a there's a similar experiment where

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:33,240
you can actually if you own a GTA

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:36,029
license you can actually write write

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,000
your own a driving simulator using GTA

00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:40,379
on a machine versus and just that's a

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,360
screen grab which would be the

00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:44,399
equivalent of the camera which you have

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,230
a new windshield so that's the only

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,850
thing why these two these companies are

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,399
using games but I have because it's

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,179
provide something where they can cheaply

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:57,000
create situations with very extensively

00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:59,039
complicated inputs and trying to write

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,590
something which we thought we couldn't

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,139
do before understand so that it's games

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,860
it's beside the point this is just a

00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:10,889
coincidence I think we're just about out

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,039
of time here I want to thank the

00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:15,720
panelists for joining us and they did

00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,519
say you get a special door prize if you

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,519
guess who's been a Red Hat the longest

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,179
