Title: Calling Serverless Functions from an Android App
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	This session will look at provisioning OpenWhisk to a Kubernetes environment from the Service Catalog, and how to consume OpenWhisk actions/functions from an Android App.
The Service Catalog leverages Service Brokers.
The Automation Broker lets you write a Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB) to provision a service to a Kubernetes environment.
An OpenWhisk APB makes it simple to provision a serverless environment to you Kubernetes environment.
Building on this, creating & executing your serverless functions from a mobile app can be made easy by using the AeroGear Mobile SDK and Mobile CLI for OpenShift.
