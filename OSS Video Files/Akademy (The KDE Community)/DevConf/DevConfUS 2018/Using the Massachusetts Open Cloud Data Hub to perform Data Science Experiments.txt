Description: 
	Have a great idea for a Data Science experiment but don't have the hardware to run it?  The Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) and Red Hat have partnered to deploy the Data Hub, an open source AI as a Service platform, into the MOC giving you access to hardware and support required for leading edge experiments.  
The MOC Infrastructure as a Service platform combined with current Data Science development tools provides you with an alternative to using public clouds to execute your experiments.
