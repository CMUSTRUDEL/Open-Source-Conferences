Title: Keynote: Research Software Engineering across Disciplines in a University Setting
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	In order to better support research efforts that require or can benefit from custom open-source software development or novel uses of existing computer science frameworks and techniques, Boston University (BU) has, over the past few years, supported the establishment and growth of a unique research software engineering entity on campus. 
The Software & Application Innovation Lab (SAIL) is a professional research, software engineering, and consulting lab that acts as a driver, a competitive advantage, and a collaborative partner for projects across BU. Interacting extensively with faculty, researchers, and students in multiple departments and schools, SAIL can leverage opportunities to introduce, identify, apply, and further develop reusable frameworks, applications, tools, and resources throughout the university research pipeline. 
In this talk we will review how SAIL has been able to support multiple communities in understanding, adopting, and developing open-source frameworks within their domains (including groups working in cybersecurity, urban data science, public health, and synthetic biology). Examples of specific opportunities and challenges associated with cultivating research software engineering in a university setting will be discussed throughout.

all right I think we're good Andre sorry

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,520
okay thank you very much

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,990
so hmm I apologize have a cold today so

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,730
your experience will not be uniform

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,730
throughout the talk listening to me

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,429
so I'm Andre lapid's I'm a computer

00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:41,230
science faculty at Boston University and

00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,609
I also direct the software and

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,050
application innovation lab I am also

00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,089
involved in something called the Hariri

00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,129
Institute so I'll tell you about some of

00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,519
these I assume that one of the reasons I

00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:52,929
was invited here as you mentioned was to

00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:55,839
kind of introduce to be you and and

00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,370
what's happening at BU to everyone now I

00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:59,350
should make a disclaimer that this isn't

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,760
this is nowhere near everything that's

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,440
happening at BU this is just things that

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,449
we're involved in or that I've been

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,780
involved in or that I'm peripheral to

00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,250
that I'm aware of but hopefully you'll

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,340
give everyone an idea of the kinds of

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,510
things that are happening at BU that are

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,100
related or would benefit from open

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,910
source or where open source is kind of

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,610
incipient

00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,200
in certain communities so there's just

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,400
an overview first I'll talk about the

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,770
Hariri Institute and the software and

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,570
application Innovation Lab and then I'll

00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,530
go over a couple of examples of work

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,210
going on at BU that

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,549
you know involves open-source or

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,649
starting to involve open-source that

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,539
again we're involved in and I'll talk a

00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:38,960
little bit about sort of the challenges

00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:40,399
and advantages and so on of trying to

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,959
bring open-source as well as bring

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,799
software engineering into an academic

00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:49,490
environment in the way that we are

00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,469
currently doing it so the various

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,229
supercomputing was founded about six

00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:56,030
years ago now to help researchers across

00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,039
Boston University who have a software

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,439
engineering computer science data

00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,299
science computational component to their

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,219
research all the way from you know

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,780
biologists and physicists the physicists

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,759
all the way down to even you know School

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,739
of Theology and we do work with School

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,140
of Theology and the humanities and

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:15,110
things like that and the very Institute

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,329
supports these kinds of efforts through

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,230
grants through recognition of faculty

00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,170
and graduate students through

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,609
fellowships but it also is a host sort

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,250
of a federation of different centers

00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,260
labs and initiatives some of them

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,079
incubate some of them it's sort of took

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,819
on after it was formed and many of these

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,340
are around specific topic areas like

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,019
artificial intelligence others are meant

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,849
to promote things like you know digital

00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,959
education or software engineering in the

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:43,700
case of the software and application

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:48,190
Novation lab as well as other other sort

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,269
of areas of interest or focus so

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,849
software engineering within an academic

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,349
environment is something that it seems

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,989
as it's starting to become recognized as

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,419
about as a possible career in a way that

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,260
it wasn't before so what I'm talking

00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,760
about here is you know the standard

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,190
career tracks involved you know you

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,510
become you become a PhD student then you

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,480
become a postdoc then you become a

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,489
faculty member and and those kinds of

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,840
tracks in academia are well recognized

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:17,120
and you know there's you know broad you

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,169
know broadly well organized structures

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,209
for people to progress through those

00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:21,500
throughout their career not so much for

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,090
research software engineering yet

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,709
although you can if you look online you

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,870
can see that these things are starting

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,940
to improve you have in the United

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,440
Kingdom for example you have these sort

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,030
of trade groups and associations and

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,379
conferences for research software

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,569
engineers to actually want to build a

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,099
career doing software engineering and

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,239
bringing best practices from software

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,610
engineering into the academic

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,590
environment and you have other examples

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,110
in the United States where for example

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,390
the Flatiron Institute I think it's

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,280
called was founded in New York City to

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,129
help researchers with sort of

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
computational challenges and as you know

00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,239
it's a very large sort of well-funded

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,610
group so things are starting to happen

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,620
and we're basically trying to do that at

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,379
Boston University so about three years

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,670
ago with this goal in mind we started

00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,470
the software and application Innovation

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,120
Lab at Boston University and the idea

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,280
here was to augment what the Institute

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,379
was doing and helping researchers and

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,389
faculty members and and students

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,410
introduce computational and software

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:19,760
engineering elements into their research

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,049
we grew very rapidly just because

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,699
there's a lot of demand for this kind of

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,199
thing so initially it was primarily to

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,639
support the seed grants where the Hariri

00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,410
Institute was supporting these kinds of

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,910
efforts but it turned out there's a lot

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,350
of researchers who have funding and I'll

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,479
talk about this a little bit later we

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,370
have funding from external funding

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,020
sources we're aware academics typically

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,210
get the bulk of their funding so these

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,620
are national organizations like the

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,419
National Institutes of Health or the

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,840
National Science Foundation as well as

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:49,910
foundations and and other sources

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,770
DARPA ARPA and so on so and you know in

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,090
this case what was very interesting is

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,800
that it also allowed us to take existing

00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,060
research efforts that maybe weren't able

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,410
to get funding from those sources

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,479
because those organizations themselves

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,900
are starting to recognize that you need

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,970
to actually support software engineering

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,430
as an end in and of itself in many

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,660
fields if you're gonna actually you know

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,610
improve those communities and you'll see

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,960
some examples of that improve the way

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,139
those communities work together and the

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,580
way they build tools and so on so

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,990
basically because the her Institute is

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,389
kind of a hub at the University and

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,680
talks so researchers all around about

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,500
the research they're planning to do or

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,050
their search they're currently doing

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,730
then

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,530
it really puts the Institute in a good

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,020
position to promote things like open

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,970
source approaches so it's true that

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,910
we've observed in many cases over the

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,380
past several years situations where you

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,970
know outside contractors were being

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,160
hired and basically they were rebuilding

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,080
the same thing over and over again in

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,500
some cases what you you might arguably

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,520
say is a waste of federal funding but

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,720
it's simply because people weren't

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,040
familiar with the fact that you can

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,420
actually take a piece of software and

00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,730
separate it into an open-source

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,260
component which is reusable and you can

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,640
probably use it not only just within one

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,190
group or within one project you're

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,530
probably across projects but also that

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,850
you can take your proprietary research

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,190
or whatever it is that you're building

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,750
and you can you can sort of isolate it

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,340
so that it becomes a configuration or an

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,080
instantiation or a parameter to that

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,870
open-source platform so you can still

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,120
have your your IP but but you'd be able

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,360
to build this kind of infrastructure

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,830
that's reusable and it also puts us in a

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,830
good position to promote best practices

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,960
so you know documenting your your code

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,680
we've had experiences where we had to

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,040
rebuild things from screenshots using CI

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,140
CD making sure that you you know use

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,400
good version control and things like

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,560
that so these are things that we're able

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,530
to promote and actually you know teach

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,210
people about throughout the BU community

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,860
because of the position that we're in

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,200
because we're working with so many

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,390
groups and talking to so many groups one

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,560
thing I will say though is a lot of the

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,260
things that I'll talk about and that we

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,030
do our application level development so

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,440
there are many groups and you'll hear

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,940
from from other groups that'd be you who

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,220
do other kinds of work but we

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,960
specifically focus on sort of

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,120
applications and and things that the

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,590
application layer so frameworks

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,250
libraries web services full stack

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,930
applications and so on we have you know

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,370
I'll mention some things that also were

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,570
production quality so we've built things

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,100
that are production quality and it had

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,050
to be deployed other things are more

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,330
kind of prototypes or things that are

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,830
facing users who happen to be

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,870
researchers

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,449
so I'll go over some for these for topic

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,889
areas that I chose where it's it's

00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,199
exciting to see sort of an open source

00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,340
approaches being adopted so one of them

00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,900
is actually experimental design and

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,150
automation and synthetic biology so

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,129
synthetic biology it's kind of a there's

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,940
lots of things going on there but sort

00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:48,090
of one prototypical workflow that I'll

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,330
focus on that there's some projects that

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,069
are funding work on is this idea of you

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,139
know if I'm gonna build these genetic

00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,259
components that essentially implement

00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:01,139
logical you know programmatic kinds of

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,819
algorithms and I'm going to you know

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,409
explore different designs to see which

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,969
ones actually have the behavior that one

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:07,469
so an example application of this is

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,969
something like I want to create some

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,849
kind of organisms that will organism

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:15,150
that will detect contaminants in water

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:17,669
by you know maybe glowing or something

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,590
like that so you can actually online

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,750
right now buy a kit to do genetic

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,400
engineering you can do it at home you

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,530
just you know you just need to order one

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,759
online so these kinds of things exist

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,360
but here we're talking about sort of

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,529
automating this on a mass scale so

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,940
basically what you're going from is a

00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,390
design to hopefully some kind of

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,070
automated infrastructure api's you know

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,270
all the way down to machines they're

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,570
actually going to run the experiments

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,029
and and synthesize biological components

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,020
that have certain functionalities so

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,670
what's really interesting is that for

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,560
example DARPA is actually funding an

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,570
effort called synergistic discovery and

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,639
design which is

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,110
bu is involved in actually a broader

00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,199
group that includes the Broad Institute

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,930
at MIT and others and duck Densmore is

00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:04,180
one of the PI's here at BU who does this

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,949
work but this program is actually

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,889
explicitly designed to say alright all

00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,350
of you labs that are sort of doing

00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,850
synthetic biology and are planning to

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,319
create you know pipelines that build

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,389
these components that are essentially

00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:18,759
biological systems that perform certain

00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,370
functions you guys need to agree on

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,509
standards that you're gonna use what

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,680
kind of ap eyes are you going to use

00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:25,720
what kind of formats are you going to

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,339
use for describing an experiment for

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,029
describing a biological component and so

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:29,350
on

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,279
and it's actually really interesting to

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,319
see you know they're actually doing

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,540
things in the way that and you would

00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,949
expect and in the way that we see other

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,290
open-source communities doing things you

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,100
know they have consortio they have

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,690
working groups they put together

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,100
standards and you know DARPA is actually

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,709
funding this kind of thing explicitly

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,060
and encouraging this kind of work so

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:51,220
specifically for example something we've

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,870
been involved in is uh there's a number

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,620
of different tools within workflows

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,180
where we've contributed to existing

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,730
standards as well as existing tools

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,709
within the community when you need to

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,240
for example build these biological

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:06,670
components there's a standard language

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,170
for visualizing these and it's amazing

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,970
to see the you know the synthetic

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,860
biologists actually run a white board

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,970
right it so fluently as if they're just

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,899
writing in English or something like

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,930
that but these sorts of images are

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,160
actually rendered in various tools so

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,720
that you can actually you know present

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,970
them or examine them and things like

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,980
that so we've had contributions where

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,690
we've added and you know the ability to

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,209
visualize additional kinds of components

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,209
within tools like visible

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:36,850
we've also contributed to several tools

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,959
for essentially generating designs so if

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,760
I want to have if I want to have some

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,070
kind of logical circuit

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,050
and I want to implement it as a you know

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,120
some kind of biological system there's

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,310
tools like cello that being worked on

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,500
including by groups at BU that I

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,020
mentioned that essentially take that

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,510
logical circuit and generate a bunch of

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,590
biological designs that could implement

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,900
that circuit and then of course you need

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,040
to test and see if they work that's part

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,910
of what this sort of experimental

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,440
workflow is is meant to support another

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,210
standard standard that's kind of growing

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,040
right now as S polls so this is a

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,870
standard for you know it could be for

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,750
describing biological components could

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,690
be for describing experiments and it's

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,190
it's an RDF based kind of XML format and

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,170
it's actually expanding right now as the

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,640
community decides what kinds of features

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,130
should be added to it to describe the

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,620
kinds of biological components that they

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,680
they want to build one thing I was

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,640
really happy and impressed by was this

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,400
open source protocol called out a

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,530
protocol which is intended primarily for

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,090
robots so essentially these are these

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,780
pipette robots that I had a picture of

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:43,240
here earlier on the on the right side

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:45,580
and basically the idea is that you know

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,320
you'd have this JSON format for you know

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,670
saying take this pipette move this much

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,160
of this material into this particular

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,870
well and it's a programmatic way to

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,890
describe this kind of process but it's

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,900
very interesting if you go to order

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,790
protocol org

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,310
you'll see that it just looks like an

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,800
API and you know this community has

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,850
actually done a great job of taking the

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,350
kinds of techniques that we're familiar

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,330
with from software engineering and

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,250
adapting it to this particular domain

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,900
it's very you know it's very encouraging

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,480
to see that it's very refreshing to use

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,670
this kind of tool and use this kind of

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,030
format when you're building pieces of

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,350
software so that's one area where it's

00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,490
definitely exciting to see these kinds

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,980
of software engineering and open-source

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,600
techniques being introduced and we're

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,320
very happy that we have the opportunity

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,020
to contribute to these here

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,610
you within the software and application

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,810
evasion lab and for the hurry Institute

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,800
to be able to support this kind of work

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,030
as well so there's another area where

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
we're seeing things change and kind of

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,960
emerge right now called digital and

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,160
electronic health and career Institute

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,810
as well as some other groups like the

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,630
Institute for health science innovation

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,310
policy as well as the mobile and

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,390
electronic health if you research

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,580
collaborative these are some of the

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,110
entities at BU that support or kind of

00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,530
encouraging some of these things to

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,760
happen but here I have an example of

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,080
sort of a series of projects that we're

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,550
doing with with some of the faculty

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,980
members at School of Public Health and

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,720
health in building something called

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,790
computerized adaptive testing platforms

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,270
so these are platforms that basically

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,640
allow you know organizations like

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,430
healthcare providers hospitals

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,960
nonprofits to provide assessments that

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,030
either could be administered by

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,940
clinicians or can be sort of self

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,350
administered by patients and users to

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,450
assess their progress if they have for

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,000
example a spinal cord injury or if they

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:33,270
have a burn injury or if they have other

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,010
conditions or maybe just sort of how

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,740
they're progressing and what the

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,810
condition is if they're healthy and

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,950
these tools actually you know and when

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,990
we came into this community

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,820
many of them were being built using you

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,700
know Visual Basic 5 and they were

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,590
running on Windows XP desktops and

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,270
things like that it was very interesting

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,440
to come into this community and try to

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,690
introduce sort of full stack web

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,630
applications using open source

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,060
frameworks to build both the backend and

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,770
the front-end components and to also

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,370
make them as a result cross-platform

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,200
more compatible with sort of web-based

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,870
environments and and now we've actually

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,960
you know had great experiences you know

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,460
you know taking some of these

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,980
organizations on the right-hand side and

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,390
helping them deploy these tools using

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,220
these and modern techniques where you

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,510
know we're using docker you

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,100
and giving them these docker images

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,770
allowing them to set this up within

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,090
their environment and it's it's really

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,440
been great to do that and one of the

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,380
interesting things that we run into here

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,110
is actually a lot of these tools have to

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:39,540
be accessible in the sense of you know

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:41,220
if if you have users who may be hearing

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,190
or sight impaired and they need to be

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,000
able to use these websites nevertheless

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,100
and one of the things that we've had

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,210
we've actually run into is there is a

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,210
government

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,820
I guess funded framework called assets

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,260
that really isn't maintained very well

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,540
and we've ended up actually having to

00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,270
use one with not-so-great license called

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,920
accessible plus for some of these tools

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,560
but we're actually thinking about right

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,180
now coming up with sort of taking assets

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,190
and maybe fixing it up ourselves here at

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,210
BU given the number of projects that

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,070
could benefit from this but the idea

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,860
here is that this is a front-end

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,780
framework that allows you to introduce

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,920
components into your web application

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,080
into your website that makes it

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,880
accessible in accordance with standards

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,530
like section 508

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,550
so this this is something where you know

00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,960
there's a lot of opportunity here for

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,260
also for private organizations as well

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,310
as nonprofits and and academic actors to

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,990
get in and sort of improve this and

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,610
maybe contribute in places where for

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,590
example the government may not have the

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,090
resources to to maintain these things I

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,070
have here web experience toolkit which

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,320
is actually a Canadian government funded

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,880
project as well just for for complete

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,820
coverage but these are examples of

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,900
things where open-source is actually you

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,090
know open-source approaches are also

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,130
going to be very valuable obviously this

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,720
is something that benefits many users

00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,970
and is essential for many of these

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,750
applications and this is where those

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,640
techniques can provide lots of benefits

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,290
so here within bu there was another

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,970
project that we're working on where it

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,680
was just you know showed us how

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,650
important it is to use good software

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,360
engineering practices so Margaret Becky

00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:18,970
is actually

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,170
on top here she's a faculty member

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,759
within the cs department and she's

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,000
working with another faculty member in

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,519
the College of Health and rehabilitation

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,649
sciences here at BU to build the system

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,230
that uses well it'll be other things

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,339
because the connect is discontinued but

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,149
at the moment we're using in Microsoft

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:39,100
Connect to essentially allow patients to

00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,449
adhere to exercises to for example

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,670
physical therapy exercises that they

00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,050
have to do at home and one thing that's

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,480
interesting about projects like this is

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,709
they really are you know heavy software

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,290
engineering projects you know there's a

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,300
team of 20 people with PhD students and

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,639
software engineers and project managers

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,310
all trying to you know collect

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,319
requirements build mock-ups put together

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,790
user interfaces put together the backend

00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,019
take components that are research

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,939
components you know these are things

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,959
that are algorithms that PhD students

00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,199
are putting together for their species

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,549
and getting and helping the PhD students

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,839
get them to the point where their

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:12,370
production quality so you can actually

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,159
have patients using this and not being

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,390
frustrated and there's a lot of project

00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,539
management that goes into this kind of

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,159
work there's a lot of coordination and

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,839
in this case you know that we're also

00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:25,000
using open source approach approaches as

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,150
well as using open source frameworks so

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,830
it's a really great opportunity for sort

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,330
of demonstrating how valuable it is to

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,460
use these approaches for these kinds of

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,130
projects that probably wouldn't have

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,809
made it this far without sort of using

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,179
sort of industry and community best

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,220
practices for for something this

00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,270
complicated so that's another ongoing

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,650
project that's happening right now

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,640
within this kind of digital and

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:52,179
electronic health space so I'll switch

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,270
over to another third example area where

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:58,059
I'm personally very involved in and we

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,380
have a lot of work in this so there's

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,330
you know next-generation cryptographic

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,100
techniques you've probably heard of home

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,809
morphic encryption and

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,610
there's another thing called multi-party

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,970
computation and basically these

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:12,250
techniques allow you to sort of factor

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,840
out what used to be a things that you

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,660
assume have to go together so you assume

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,370
that if you want to take data from

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,410
multiple organizations and do some kind

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,660
of joint computation over it to analyze

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,820
it you know you would assume that you

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,020
need to actually share that data give it

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,540
to some party and then it'll do the

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,220
computation it turns out with techniques

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,690
like multi-party computation and homo

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,059
work encryption and so on you can

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,679
actually separate computation from being

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,480
it from actually being able to read and

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,010
hold the data I can for example encrypt

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,900
my data and give it to some kind of

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,040
service provider they do the analysis

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,540
without ever seeing the data or the

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,980
results they give me back the encrypted

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,440
results I decrypt the results and I look

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,059
at them so these things are all possible

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,860
but these are not techniques that are

00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:53,290
currently being used in production you

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,059
know in the real world and one of the

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,640
things that we currently have is a bunch

00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,900
of grants from the National Science

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,929
Foundation as well as other partners

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,330
that are explicitly you know for

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,309
building open source libraries that will

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,230
then allow others to build applications

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:09,880
and services on top of these open source

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,220
libraries to introduce these kinds of

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,360
features into their applications so here

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,590
we have a list of different libraries

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,570
and some there's other talks that you'll

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,340
hear during this conference about some

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,809
of these like for example Conclave as

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,970
well as the applications where they're

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:24,280
being used but we're essentially being

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,370
funded by NSF to build libraries that

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,900
are open source and that can be sort of

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,080
deployed and used within applications

00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:36,309
and excuse me we've actually been able

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,049
to to take some of these and and deploy

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,250
them which I'll mention in a second now

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,840
one thing that one approach that we've

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,130
taken here when we when we started this

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,540
is there are a lot of libraries

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,020
obviously buildings being put together

00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,910
within this community by researchers you

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,470
know faculty members graduate students

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,480
but one of the approaches that we took

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,860
when we started building some of these

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,570
but in particular because we knew we

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,160
needed to deploy them when we needed to

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,870
deploy them for applications that are

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,299
basically basically going to run at the

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,330
you know on browsers that end-users are

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,270
using on their

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,340
you know laptops and so on we actually

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,080
had to from scratch build them using you

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,370
know JavaScript for example so that they

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,870
run on all the browsers and that you can

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,790
build applications are compatible on all

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,650
browsers so there's an air this is a

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,940
library called JavaScript implementation

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,950
of federated functionalities that we

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,140
built to support those kinds of

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,090
environments there's lots of demos

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,740
online that you can look at it and you

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,740
kind of see these libraries from a few

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,910
slides ago sort of where they went or

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,010
where they're going now so we have

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,660
collaborations with the city of Boston

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,010
the Boston Women's workforce council

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,450
where these libraries were actually used

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,400
to build applications that have been

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,730
deployed over the past several three

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,630
years or so in production used by

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,020
hundreds of companies across Boston

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,370
where you know they're basically loading

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,110
this application in the browser and

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,210
contributing data to a computation in a

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,950
privacy-preserving way we have a

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,140
partnership with the research institutes

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,320
and this is 200 research institutes

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,179
credit that it actually is supporting

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,650
open source development development so

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,940
they're funding this work they're their

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,910
funding open source libraries that they

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,790
hope to benefit from as well and we've

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,860
actually built prototypes and demos of

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,110
things like so let's say you have

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,660
Google's routing service right so Google

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,910
allows you to say I'm here I want to go

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,280
there and it returns to you sort of a

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,960
path of how to how to get to that

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,550
destination so you can actually build

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,140
that service in the way such that Google

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,280
never sees your query it doesn't know

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,450
where you're starting and it doesn't

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,000
know where you're going nevertheless

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,809
it's able to tell you how to get there

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,700
so you can do this in a

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,320
privacy-preserving way using these

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,630
techniques and using these kinds of

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,460
libraries that we've put together we've

00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,380
been fortunate to work with callisto

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,520
project as well we've put together some

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,020
libraries that allow them to use

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,610
multi-party computation techniques

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,610
within their service Callisto is a

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,350
sexual-assault reporting service that

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,250
runs on a number of campuses right now

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,040
and they're building sort of a

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,840
next-generation version of their

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,560
of their offering that is going to use

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,290
some of these next-generation

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,520
cryptographic techniques and and we were

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,620
able to put together some open-source

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,510
libraries thanks to the NSF funding for

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,000
them as well as I mentioned you'll hear

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,470
about Conclave which is another project

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,840
that involves the Massachusetts open

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,100
cloud data verse and actually Red Hat I

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,230
think is involved in this as well at

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,430
this point and it's a very interesting

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,500
project you'll hear more about it in

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,620
subsequent talks but one of the

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,780
libraries there is again something that

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,980
we've been working on funded by NSF that

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,470
contributes to this project and allows

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,270
these kinds of privacy-preserving

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,330
computations to take place within cloud

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,580
cloud environments

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:35,440
so the last topic I'll kind of talk

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,550
about is urban data science so you host

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,290
something called the initiative on

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:42,880
cities which was I think started by the

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:45,400
former mayor and the initiative tries to

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,620
connect researchers and students at

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Boston University with cities in

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,830
particular the city of Boston but also

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,150
other cities in the area to sort of

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,170
address issues and what's interesting

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,690
over the last you know three or four

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,970
years maybe even more so the sort of two

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,760
to three years is cities have started to

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,200
embrace open data right so they

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,580
basically take all the data that used to

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,170
be in you know document paper form or

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,700
just going into a black hole or some

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,080
server somewhere and never looked at

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,850
again and they've been taking them and

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,680
turning them into these open data

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,510
portals that are accessible to everyone

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,040
so right now you can go online you can

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,810
go to analyze Boston and you can see you

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,580
know here's all the bike paths in Boston

00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,020
here all the three one one calls here

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,860
are all the 911 calls here's where all

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,170
the accidents happen and and and you

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,800
know so far it's a difficult challenge

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,850
for cities to actually go beyond that

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,280
because they don't really have the

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,810
resources to then take that and build

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,600
solutions based on that data they're

00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,710
just trying to get the data out there

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,330
but they are using sort of open source

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,270
frameworks like C can and Socrative API

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:50,320
to do that but what we've been doing is

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:52,240
for example supporting student kind of

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,510
project-based courses as well as other

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,310
projects that are funded by NSF to build

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,540
tools that use that data or work to

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,040
build tools that allow others to use

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,930
that data so we have this kind of this

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,430
diagram of this ecosystem various little

00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,830
components that allow someone to take

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,480
you know if I have the bike path data

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,460
set from the city of Boston can I take

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,840
that and then for example find the most

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,370
efficient way to connect the bike paths

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,560
where could I place additional bike

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,050
paths to sort of connect them up and

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,250
have them have better continuity so in

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,600
order to do that you have to retrieve

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,130
the data you have to store it somewhere

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,540
you have to build a pipeline that maybe

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,450
can retrieve updated versions of that

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,550
data over time and what you need to do

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,720
is then maybe run an optimization

00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,790
algorithm over it but that requires

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,210
converting that data from whatever you

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:35,950
know GIS format or sort of OpenStreetMap

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,510
style format it's in to something that's

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,160
gonna be compatible with you know

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,990
Network text and Python or something

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,030
like that so we've put a lot of

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,620
libraries and a sort of tools to support

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,510
that kind of thing and students have

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,130
been able to contribute as well as use

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,380
those kinds of tools within courses that

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,590
are offered at bu where they use these

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,660
open datasets and they do projects you

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,210
know focused on sort of solving problems

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,550
with optimization techniques and sort of

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,080
statistical analysis techniques we've

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:06,220
been able also to do it ourselves in a

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,890
couple of cases recently Boston had the

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,360
Boston Public Schools had a challenge to

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,920
find a better way to route school buses

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,770
to reduce costs it was a little

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,450
controversial we were careful to not get

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,100
into the controversial part of it we

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,059
actually just what we did was we offered

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,549
to create an anonymized sort of

00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:26,109
data set is representative of the

00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,239
distribution of students in the Boston

00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,440
area but is not actually the addresses

00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:31,840
of all the children in the Boston area

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,700
and we did that by essentially taking a

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,090
collection of different open data sets

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,739
and using a bunch of tools to to build

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,239
something that has the same distribution

00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,039
in terms of the number of students going

00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,629
to number of schools and you have to get

00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,249
it right so if you see on the picture on

00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,570
the left here that just connects every

00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:48,369
student with a straight line to the

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,749
school that they attend in the Boston

00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:52,059
area for example because of the way that

00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:54,070
Boston assigned students to schools you

00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,529
see there's a lot of cross traffic north

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,089
to south there so it's not terribly

00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:59,320
efficient in terms of transportation but

00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,639
you have to kind of create something

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,359
that's representative of the actual

00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:05,649
challenges that the routing you know

00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,299
algorithms might face if they're

00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:10,179
actually going to figure out how to

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,889
transport all these students so this was

00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,629
an opportunity to use some of these

00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:14,799
tools use some of these data sets and

00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:19,059
for us to kind of get involved in a

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,559
project that you know hopefully at least

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,419
provided a beneficial data set that

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,129
others could use to do the actual

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:27,489
routing challenge so full disclosure mit

00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:28,839
won the challenge for routing although

00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:30,489
again as you can read the newspaper

00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:34,929
articles to see what the controversy was

00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:37,210
there so I wanted to kind of now step

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:40,570
back from the specific topic areas and

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,969
just kind of demonstrate some of the

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,099
ways in which by doing all of these

00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,570
things certainly the software and

00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:49,739
application innovation at a lab at BU

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:53,859
has been able to find opportunities to

00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:55,650
reuse and also leverage our experience

00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:59,790
working in one area

00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:01,860
to basically you know inform or or give

00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,470
us something that we can reuse or have

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,240
an advantage in in another area so it's

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,770
just like we call it the spider diagram

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,910
sometimes some of the projects that

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,470
we've worked on some of the tools that

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,300
we use to support those projects in

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,680
particular areas of research and you can

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,380
group them in various ways but this is

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,910
sort of just one way of grouping some of

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,460
these projects so just to give an

00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:24,930
example one thing that we've we've been

00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,250
able to do is build a back-end system

00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,570
that we've reused throughout projects

00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,090
the backend system basically does things

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,100
like user management authentication and

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,510
you can you know manage data but we've

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,250
been able to use it for these

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,810
computerized adaptive testing platforms

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,990
we've been using it we've been able to

00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,850
use it for synthetic biology databases

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:44,220
we've been able to use it for sort of

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:48,540
situations where you need to build tools

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,250
that you know are HIPAA compliant and by

00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,290
taking this open source platform that

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,780
again we've seen people rebuild over and

00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,980
over again building our own kind of

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,750
version of it on top of open source

00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,550
frameworks making it open source we've

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,870
actually been able to save a lot of

00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,210
effort on our part and we've been able

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,860
to take features that benefit one

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,080
community and sort of transfer it to

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,010
another community and people are

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,130
starting to accept that they're starting

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,070
to understand that oh it's okay that you

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,770
know I'm going to fund an improvement to

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,300
this open source project and you know

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,640
save some of my funding for the actual

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,410
work of the research rather than build

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,540
the whole thing top to bottom and sort

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,100
of own everything which doesn't really

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,330
benefit anyone because you're again

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,080
you're just rebuilding the same kind of

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,150
backend from scratch each time front

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,140
ends as well we've kind of

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,730
embarrassingly reused front-end

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,980
frameworks and components across

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,030
projects that are vastly different you

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,530
know

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:44,010
and yet we've been able to sort of reuse

00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:46,590
this stuff and you know again save

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,840
effort get benefits of future

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,230
improvements across these projects in

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,240
these kinds of scenarios and then just

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,710
sort of from a competitive advantage

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,240
standpoint right so the one of the

00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,590
reasons the Hariri Institute exists at

00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,299
Boston University is to make it possible

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,280
for researchers to be more competitive

00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:06,200
when they apply for external funding to

00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,159
NSF to NIH and places like that and

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,659
among the things that you need to have

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:16,440
there is you know thank you very much

00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:20,370
appreciate that so one of the things

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,020
that you you would benefit from is you

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,549
know you have built frameworks before

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,440
you've worked on you've used best

00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:27,870
practices before you're able to reuse

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,110
those and say I can reuse this in the

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,820
project if the NSF funds it or I'm able

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,230
to do what I ask a new kind of question

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,299
because I ran into it while working on

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,010
these on these kinds of projects so I

00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,330
talked about a little the digital health

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,640
projects before where we were able to

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,140
take things that we're familiar with

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,400
from software engineering and kind of

00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,679
bring you know frameworks and best

00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,820
practices into these communities and and

00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,360
build all these tools with all these

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,530
collaborators and sort of that's great

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,270
but many of these for example require

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,919
HIPAA compliance so then we can say ok

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,570
well we have familiarity with that

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,500
because we do cybersecurity research we

00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,880
do this sort of next generation

00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,140
cryptography research we can actually

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,720
take some of these techniques and bring

00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,429
it into these projects and now we can

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,900
you know maybe use a slightly more

00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,030
sophisticated form of encryption to

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,830
manage sort of multi multiple layers of

00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,780
users and the way that they can have

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,490
access to different components so you

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,659
know we can bring that into the

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,610
frameworks because that we have

00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,870
experience with that of course also

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,000
builds our own sort of experience the

00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,470
experience of our interns and so on as

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,880
we do that but then you can actually

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,039
turn around and go back and say now that

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,360
I'm in this community I actually have

00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,200
introduced two new problems that I

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,000
haven't seen before

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,770
because I'm familiar with all these

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,360
members of this community and now I can

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,919
actually go back to Anna Stephan say

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,200
they actually would benefit from

00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,909
additional kinds of work in cyber

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,539
security and cryptography that hasn't

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:40,100
been done yet

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,480
but that

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,400
we could do and then they would be able

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,220
to use and you can go back to NSF and

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,380
say we'd like to do this work please you

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,690
know please fund it it'll require some

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,370
basic research but also require us to do

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,630
the software engineering too to put it

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,799
into production and have patients

00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,450
actually be able to use these features

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,880
we've been able to do that with some

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,130
partners like Crandall hey Charlie is a

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,940
is a startup that actually tries to

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:07,580
address the recidivism in opioid

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,700
addiction and help patients not sort of

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,780
return to their bad habits and one of

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,390
the things that we were able to do for

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,320
them is build build this kind of

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,330
encrypted back-end that allows them to

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,010
analyze and store data without actually

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,289
having to just store sensitive data

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,000
about patients and sort of their

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:25,990
histories and so on

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,340
other examples we've been able again to

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,450
allow students within these urban data

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,010
science projects to use the

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,950
Massachusetts open cloud for example as

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:36,919
well as sort of efficient frameworks for

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,840
doing big data computations in these

00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,000
kinds of environments and then again as

00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,710
a result of us being able to go to the

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,600
city of Boston or the collaborators and

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,460
say here we've helped you with something

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,870
they come back and they trust us to tell

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,520
us you know problems because if you go

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,440
you know usually if a researcher goes to

00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,490
like the city of Boston and says we'd

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,840
like to work with you on something

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,460
they're like who are you I've never

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,289
worked with you before I don't really

00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,210
trust that if some of your students

00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,559
learn about my problem that they're

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,690
gonna come back a year later or a few

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,360
months later and actually solve it but

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,039
by actually doing something first and

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,240
building a relationship you actually get

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,500
to talk to people and they tell you what

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,330
their real problems are and that's how

00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,940
some of our some of this multi-party

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,169
computation deployment work happened as

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,179
a result of the fact that we already had

00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:19,340
relationships with the city of Boston

00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:21,770
based on previous engagements and then

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,840
that goes back into again allowing us to

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,270
ask for funding to do research and cyber

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,559
security cryptography and so on for

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,559
things like multi-party computation

00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:36,600
so I did not plan to get sick all right

00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,170
so anyway so that hopefully gives you an

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,390
idea of the way that we've been able to

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:44,400
leverage the fact that we are using

00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:47,640
software engineering practices and sort

00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,240
of open-source techniques to enrich the

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,160
research community at BU and to sort of

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,470
find new opportunities both for

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,430
researchers as well as for introducing

00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,010
software engineering and open-source

00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:03,690
best practices into into these

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,280
communities and and again I want to I

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,870
want to you know pause and say there's a

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,250
lot of other things going on at BU this

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,410
is just a small slice of things that

00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,370
we've been involved in there's a lot of

00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,510
things going on at the School of

00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,320
Engineering there's a lot of things

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:17,730
going on even even within the hurried

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,670
suit that I haven't mentioned that again

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,620
you'll hear another talks and and I hope

00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:26,100
you do attend those talks and hear about

00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:29,280
those other those other topic areas but

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,750
so that's us relational lab and these

00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,340
are some of our sources of funding now

00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,070
hear from these external agencies and

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,740
other partner organizations that from

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,980
the sort of the majority of our work and

00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,330
thank you very much for listening to

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,010
what's going on at BU hopefully gives

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,000
you a better idea of what's happening

00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,130
and also a better idea of the

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,610
opportunities that you have to engage

00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:53,340
with the academic community around some

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,380
of these areas as well as many others so

00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:01,029
thank you very much

00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,029
[Music]

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,280
thank you very much thanks hundred it's

00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,620
really great appreciate the appreciate

00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,460
the talk I forgot to mention one thing

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:18,590
which is that in this room here is the

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,169
Red Hat Boston University collaboratory

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:25,160
track all the talks in this room today

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,360
will be presented by interns from bu who

00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,000
have been working with us over the

00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,980
summer so please be sure to check those

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,840
out if you find them interesting

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,210
we got a coffee break now so get some

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,970
coffee enjoy it enjoy this stuff we're

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,970
