Title: Keynote: Research Software Engineering across Disciplines in a University Setting
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	In order to better support research efforts that require or can benefit from custom open-source software development or novel uses of existing computer science frameworks and techniques, Boston University (BU) has, over the past few years, supported the establishment and growth of a unique research software engineering entity on campus. 
The Software & Application Innovation Lab (SAIL) is a professional research, software engineering, and consulting lab that acts as a driver, a competitive advantage, and a collaborative partner for projects across BU. Interacting extensively with faculty, researchers, and students in multiple departments and schools, SAIL can leverage opportunities to introduce, identify, apply, and further develop reusable frameworks, applications, tools, and resources throughout the university research pipeline. 
In this talk we will review how SAIL has been able to support multiple communities in understanding, adopting, and developing open-source frameworks within their domains (including groups working in cybersecurity, urban data science, public health, and synthetic biology). Examples of specific opportunities and challenges associated with cultivating research software engineering in a university setting will be discussed throughout.
