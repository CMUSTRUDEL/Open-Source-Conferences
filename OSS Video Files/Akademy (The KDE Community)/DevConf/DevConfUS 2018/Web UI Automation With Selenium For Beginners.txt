Title: Web UI Automation With Selenium For Beginners
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	This talk will cover the process of designing and developing automated tests to exercise a web-based application.

First, I will talk about Selenium IDE and Scirroco to illustrate the process of interacting with a live web browser instance and how to identify and perform actions on the web elements found within a web page.

I will then programmatically create a web browser instance which will be used to interact with a web application, all done from the comfort of a Python console.

We will graduate to writing actual test modules, exploring Python's Unittest module and PyTest, comparing and contrasting how test cases can be written in each format.

We will wrap things up with a detailed discussion about using SauceLabs and Travis to run your automated tests across different web browsers.
