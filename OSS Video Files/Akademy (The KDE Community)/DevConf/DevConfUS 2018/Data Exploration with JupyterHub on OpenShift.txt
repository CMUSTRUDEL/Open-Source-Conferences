Title: Data Exploration with JupyterHub on OpenShift
Publication date: 2019-02-21
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Jupyter Notebooks are very popular among people from Python beginners to Data Scientist. They allow for easy experimentation with Python code and fast iteration on the problem. We decided to provide a service called JupyterHub to our team. This service allows anyone to develop and execute Jupyter Notebooks remotely. We run our JupyterHub on OpenShift, use Ceph as a storage and use plugins to integrate with other services.

In this talk, we will walk through our deployment and use cases. If all goes well, you should have all the information to run your own JupyterHub when you leave.
