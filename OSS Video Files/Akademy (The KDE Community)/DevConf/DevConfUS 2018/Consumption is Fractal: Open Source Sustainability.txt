Title: Consumption is Fractal: Open Source Sustainability
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	While open-source sustainability has been a common topic in the hallways tracks and dev channels of major projects for years, the Heartbleed vulnerability in 2014 catapulted the topic into the spotlight. Since then we've seen many discussions about how open-source should be supported for the long term, but rarely much action beyond a few token donations and some long Twitter threads. In this talk we'll look at an overview of what kinds of projects are out there, how sustainability works in real terms, and what techniques have worked or not worked over the years.

Bueller

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,240
to make sure you guys

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:39,920
well today's beer yeah

00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:43,390
gosh all right so you good to go do any

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,390
audio or video with your presentation

00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:53,710
love is off for now just don't turn back

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:56,670
and serve daughter levels seen okay and

00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,670
I'm loud anyway

00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,479
with your it was supposed to start at

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,079
10:40 but we probably give people

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,610
another five minutes just what everyone

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,610
fills our infantino

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,170
you can still hear someone talking I

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,710
don't know if they're they're still

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,710
going or not

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,410
for those just arriving real story

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,410
five

00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:39,050
with all three of those months ago long

00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,050
anyway that we did few months

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,000
just something do you have any questions

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,330
during the course of the talk

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,229
please seasonal year

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,229
have to question

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,790
[Music]

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,690
I got okay so people might still filter

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,030
in because it sounds like they're still

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,520
chatter out there but let's get started

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,870
so that's me in all of the places I'm an

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,490
instruction engineer at a company called

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,130
ride cell and I'm here today to talk

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,450
about open source sustainability we're

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,010
talking about sustainability let's lay

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,480
out a little bit of scope a lot of

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,640
people have very specific opinions about

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,440
what constitutes open source I'm gonna

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,000
take a much more general stance away

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,220
from the specifics of what precisely

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,900
makes something open I'm also not gonna

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,990
wade into open source versus free

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,210
software at all so that of the way let's

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,340
look at a few types of projects of what

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,200
I consider open source majority of

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,610
projects by the numbers one person

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,590
writes some code to do a thing and they

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,180
put it up on github because why not so I

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,100
got my start in open source writing

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,570
plugins for a bug tracker called track

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,490
but the more visible projects are the

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,020
big ones is the projects so vast and

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,130
omnipresent it's easy to just think of

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,890
them as part of the fabric of the

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,690
universe some of those very big projects

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,460
eventually actually have to build legal

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,720
entities around them usually projects

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,350
that are partnerships between multiple

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,700
large corporations at a newer venue for

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,320
open source projects has been vc-backed

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,820
startups so the company acts as a

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,560
steward for some form of open source

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,170
project and they sell stuff on the side

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,090
we'll get to the selling later what I

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,550
call Mirage projects feel like an

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,590
offshoot of that so big it's part of the

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,030
fabric of the universe idea except he's

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,140
also the frightening leaf you core

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,030
maintainer so we all saw this during

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,710
heartbleed where the entire world sort

00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,210
of simultaneously realized that there

00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,800
were a single-digit number of volunteers

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,290
maintaining this enormous ly important

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,880
core infrastructure some older projects

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,140
especially big Linux packagers tend to

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,120
feel a little bit stuffy compared to the

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,070
newer wave of you know github generation

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,270
projects but these projects are very

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,100
important history they've been designed

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,980
to stick around to a long term as

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,060
individual contributors come and go some

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,980
open source projects can only be

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,920
described as crazy ridiculous moonshots

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,990
I'm usually led by a single person then

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,400
sort of organized around we just have to

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,140
get this done

00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,220
and in my very wide view open-source

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,260
there's a lot of things that aren't

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,940
software to some of the legal specifics

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,440
differ and how you license and maintain

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,060
these but they were all sort of

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,490
contributor dynamics are basically the

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,660
same it's clearly not a complete list of

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,800
every type of open-source project out

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,420
there but it gives you a taste the kind

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,370
of breadth that I'm gonna be talking

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,500
about so that's two words from title

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,510
what about the third literally speaking

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,980
sustainability means taking a projects

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,510
that exist today and ensuring it will

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,120
exist tomorrow and the tomorrow after

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,500
that and so on money and time are

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,760
important and we'll get to talking about

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,960
those in a few minutes but the

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,550
fundamental limiting factor on most

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,900
open-source projects is the rate of

00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,910
burnout of contributors and maintainer

00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,930
x' most projects failed not for

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,570
technical reasons but because people

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,190
don't want to work on them anymore the

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,900
most common symptoms of burnout in

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,190
open-source are these three things a

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,440
cycle of feeling guilty about letting

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,790
down your users leading to dread about

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,620
working on the project and finally

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,589
bitterness towards the project itself or

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,880
sometimes the users of the project open

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,380
source projects have truly taken over

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
the world in almost every facet of

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,310
technology computer resources have

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,540
pushed pushed us further and faster and

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,220
we want this pace of progress to

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,839
continue we need these communal and

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,700
shared resources but with this

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,529
cross-pollination comes interdependence

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,930
while open licensing helps to ensure the

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,670
possibility of someone picking up a

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,050
fallow project it doesn't help us if

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,720
there's no maintainer there to pick up

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,279
the Fallen banner and if I keep the rest

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,260
for a few moments about why I think

00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,000
open-source itself is important I think

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,400
we can build things together much better

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,330
than any one team or organization a lot

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,910
of problems in software

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,279
there's so little value to the market

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,660
that it's hard to define how the market

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,820
would even come up with a solution for

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,700
this but collectively all of us together

00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,810
can and we're all better off for it

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,790
so open-source rules the world and I

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,170
think that's great but clearly I also

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,089
think there's problems of the system or

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,800
I wouldn't be giving this talk how do we

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,390
end up with a worldwide ecosystem of

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,910
software projects built on the backs of

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,650
a relatively tiny number of volunteers

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,030
if we want a globally simplistic answer

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,800
instruction investment has been lagging

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,110
across the board putting time and money

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,030
in things like bridges and dams doesn't

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,520
show returns immediately if a return can

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,810
even be quantified if your focus is only

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,160
on the earnings report for the next

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,410
quarter things are gonna slip through

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,720
the cracks but a deeper structural

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,420
answer at least in my view is in how we

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,880
make things I can only put my brain

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,220
towards building one thing at a time but

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,990
while I'm doing that I'm using probably

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,390
hundreds of other projects and tools

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,340
even in the best scenario there's always

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,920
going to be more users than contributors

00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,510
and that imbalance has spiraled far out

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,970
of control for most open source projects

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,680
even a simple project like a Ruby on

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,250
Rails web app I just sort of made this

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,050
up off the top of my head the the rails

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,780
app at the top of the list sits on a

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,010
mountain of projects and libraries as we

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,270
build better and better abstractions

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,190
which is great and we should keep doing

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,570
that it becomes easier to forget the

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,570
shoulders of the Giants on which we

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,520
stand but why all this interest and

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,260
sustainability lately

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,000
way back when open source is just some

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,580
crazy college students several of them

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,630
actually from right around here

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,400
basically everyone that consumed open

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,680
source also worked on it so maybe I

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,810
worked on GCC and you worked on bash but

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,340
we all used the same sort of suite of

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,650
tools and we all benefited from each

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,050
other's work over time this balance

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,910
eroded more people pull value out of the

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,860
system that are putting it back in as

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,480
the third dish wave of open source

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,040
developers are reaching middle-age and

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,840
deciding that maybe other pursuits are

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,550
more important often there's no longer

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,610
fresh faces willing to take up the

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,200
banner and so here we are it's hard to

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,150
pick a patient zero but it's probably

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,860
either the lamp stack or Ruby on Rails

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,290
that got the ball rolling on corporate

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,420
use of open source VC funded startups

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,340
usually in the early 90s realize they

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,770
could switch to free as in beer tools

00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,600
and save money and the VCS didn't know

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,760
about this so the cheques stayed the

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,170
same size

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,660
let me extend all these startups use

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,880
that money to just pad their own profits

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,260
if I'm being nice they used that

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,610
additional money to double down and

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,630
figure out household web thing was going

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,050
to work because I was still pretty new

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,000
at the time but all good

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,470
must come to an end and by now startups

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,480
and big companies alike know that zero

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,170
cost software stacks exist and many are

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,140
of extremely high quality budgets have

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,300
all adapted to this so companies often

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,459
have no choice especially small small

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,399
new startups they can't afford anything

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,920
else at the end of the day open source

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,630
and capitalism are at loggerheads

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,459
capitalism requires or at least strongly

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,829
encourages privatization and open source

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,240
is the exact opposite of that as long as

00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,649
the bulk of companies continue to draw

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,910
more value from the Commons they put

00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,100
back in we're going to have a

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,420
sustainability problem much of the

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,800
interaction between capitalism open

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,180
source is related to intellectual

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,310
property but I did a whole talk on that

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,700
last year so that URL will be up again

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,959
later if you want to check that talk out

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,970
just a general answer to why things went

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,440
wrong what about some specific projects

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,910
that were ultimately unsustainable in

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,890
one way or another two that are very

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,019
close to my heart react and rethink tbh

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,190
these were both originally vc-backed

00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,529
startups but there are open source

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,450
projects from the beginning the founder

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,160
of rethink to be put up a fantastic post

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,870
mortem on what he thinks went wrong with

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,040
the company side of the equation and I

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,050
think it should be required reading for

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,089
basically everyone at open source but

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,160
roughly it was an extremely saturated

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,690
market both in finance and in mine share

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,370
and they just couldn't get a foothold

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,839
whatever you think about my sequel and

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,579
Postgres and whichever of those you

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,079
prefer they've set an extremely high bar

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,790
for what is available for free and

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,480
people are just not really willing to

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:39,190
pay for databases anymore be played in

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,079
the Android open source world cyanogen

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,540
and their former OS distribution santa

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:44,950
gen mod in 2016 there's a big management

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,180
shake-up of the company and they looked

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,190
at their books and they decided the

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,779
benefits of being open source in terms

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,970
of contributions they were bringing in

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,680
were vastly outweighed by how much they

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,120
were spending on user support and the

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,680
amount of money that they could pull in

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
from people that would pay for it if it

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,430
weren't free so they decided it just

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,980
wasn't worth it anymore

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,570
two notable individual cases why the

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,950
lucky stiff from the Ruby community and

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,810
Mark Cohen from the Python community I

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,089
say this not as a colleague of either of

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,470
them but it's cautionary tale if you put

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,990
too much of a burden of a single

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,200
community on one person it rarely works

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,990
out well for either side and the more

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,730
general example drive-by contributors

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,740
people that just sort of show up they do

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,660
one commit and they leave

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,010
drybeck contributors bring really

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,779
important fixes they tell you when your

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,960
user experience is bad they fix weird

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,610
rare bugs and sometimes you can convert

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,500
them into regular contributors or even

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,180
maintainers eventually on the other hand

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,770
it takes a lot of time and energy to

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,260
Shepherd that first contribution and

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:44,170
doing that over and over and over again

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,760
it can be extremely draining there's not

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,470
a great answer here but just be aware of

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
the problem and step back from entering

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,779
first-time contributors if you just

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,589
don't have the energy to deal with

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,029
anymore that's okay such things detract

00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:56,770
from sustainability how about things

00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,210
that improve it a big part of any

00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,260
project is how it's run and that can

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,690
have similar large effect on

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,370
sustainability a benevolent dictator for

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,860
life is where most projects start from

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,809
projects created by one person and more

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,459
contributors slowly joined but that one

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,020
person remains in charge of figuring out

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,939
the overall direction where the project

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,709
is going to go this could work very well

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,150
for a young project but eventually

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,130
having to run all those decisions

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,510
through one person can slowly create

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,809
more and more friction and frustration

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,880
over time so some projects that started

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,250
out with one BD FL eventually fragment

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,809
into a number of these smaller BD FL

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,540
like maintainer x' that all just sort of

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,130
exchanged patches Linux is the the

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,929
canonical example of this there isn't

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,360
actually one Linux kernel there's like

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,780
40 of them and they just all work with

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,340
each other strange ways this can reduce

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,720
friction for the maintainer that are

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,010
exchanging patches but it can be

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,270
intimidating for a new contributor

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,780
trying to figure out how to get a patch

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,340
in and where it even goes

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,590
some projects have a more rigid

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,970
hierarchy for positions this makes it

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,380
really easy for engineers to work out

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,450
disputes there's very clear dispute

00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,940
resolution processes but it brings a lot

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,250
of social overhead with it others use a

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,830
federated Council approach usually these

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,470
are called SIG's but that's sort of the

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,440
newer term each group has final say over

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,670
their area of expertise and sometimes

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,930
when the contributor base is stable

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,400
enough over time you can forego

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,110
basically all the rules and just say

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,970
work on rough consensus when enough

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,380
people agree just do the thing and if we

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,520
need to change it will change it it's

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,620
gonna feel great for long time

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,360
contributors but it can also really

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,860
easily result in hidden power structures

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,590
like the one person that is in charge

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,210
but is not marked as in charge and that

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,450
can be utterly incomprehensible for new

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,580
people and there's a lot of other models

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,280
as what the project types I can't

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,780
possibly hope to exhaustively list these

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,280
every project isn't gonna be only one of

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,140
these they're gonna pull together a set

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,540
of governance rules that matches

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,330
hopefully their specific circumstances

00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,860
and people Conway's law states that the

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,210
output of any team is going to

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,070
eventually look a lot like the org chart

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,600
of that team it's intended to be a bit

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,520
of a tongue-in-cheek joke but it's also

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,020
remarkably accurate choice of leadership

00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,460
and decision-making structure doesn't

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,520
just affect the humans it affects the

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,480
software of those humans produce

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,070
unfortunately it can be a bit hard

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,020
sometimes to tell which direction to

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,420
move in to improve sustainability for

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,490
your project for some projects more

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,500
structure can help to reduce the burden

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,540
on overloaded maintained errs on other

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,070
projects giving them more paperwork to

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,510
fill out will push them even further

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,160
into burnout so when you're playing with

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,780
governance structures always make sure

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,820
to listen to the people that you are

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,880
governing and make sure to change things

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,590
if it's not working out for them as I

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,360
mentioned before open licensing is an

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,860
important component of open source it's

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,450
not directly related to governance model

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,060
but I needed to put this somewhere and

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,710
one often influences the other a good

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,300
license ensures that even if all of the

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,650
contributors or project move on at least

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,300
in theory the source code will main

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,830
available it'll still be up somewhere

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,840
and people can use it they can fork it

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,640
they can continue the project what about

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,610
cases where the license can be more than

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,620
just a backstop full interest C's of GPL

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,880
or copyleft general licensing are better

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,390
left to that intellectual property talk

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,020
I mentioned before but

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,490
the idea of copyleft is in its own way

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,070
sustainability GPL doesn't actually care

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,330
about the money side of sustainability

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,860
but we'll talk a little about dual

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,690
licensing later which sort of gets into

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,360
that exactly how it works depends on the

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,429
GPL flavor that you use but the other

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,140
idea is that if someone is going to

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,420
modify your code it has to be available

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,820
to the users and thus probably to you as

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,290
the maintainer one failure mode of those

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,970
really big projects I mentioned before

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,620
is that if they use a permissive license

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,630
someone can fork it change it to keep

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,669
the patches themselves and in theory

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,970
that can siphon off resources from your

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:32,410
project on to their fork again in theory

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,090
if you put your project under copyleft

00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,830
license it heads off this whole cycle

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,169
because you can always get their patches

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,030
and hypothetically if you want them you

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,220
can introduce them into your own project

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,230
but really how often is this happened

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,970
definitely nonzero big projects notably

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,620
the Linux kernel itself definitely have

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,970
issues with proprietary extensions

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,400
causing friction for both users and

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,290
maintainer x' but in my personal view is

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,669
that this is probably not going to be a

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,559
thing for your project I think that

00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:58,030
copyleft probably for most projects

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,299
causes more problems than it solves but

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,860
maybe your project is different okay in

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,410
the end maintain the open-source is

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,820
about time and time is money the

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,799
simplest funding model is to just not

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,540
have one be a volunteer project and

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,130
those are great some people just like

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,480
coding for its own sake some people want

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,730
to improve their professional portfolio

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,830
but remember volunteer your time is an

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,510
act of altruism I speak from personal

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,010
experience it's really easy to end up in

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,299
that cycle of guilt and bitterness that

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,570
I mentioned before until you just never

00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,580
want to see a computer again

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,560
the next step up is working on open

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,000
source on your normal work hours this

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,470
might be a project that your company

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,330
maintains that you're improving or

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,130
contributing a bug fix back to a project

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,630
that your company uses and it's a great

00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,220
option when you can do it but a lot of

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,180
companies don't really understand why

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,110
they should pay someone to give

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,960
something away for free

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,520
so not always an option the next step up

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,730
from one person using company time is

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,620
everyone using company time it's not a

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,210
long term solution but it can be a way

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,890
to get a new or nascent project off the

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,840
ground you'll need to look into some of

00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,720
these other options to eventually repay

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,410
your investors that's the idea at least

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,370
so now we have through the realm of

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,690
projects that are trying to be

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,160
self-sustaining to bring in enough

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,270
income to support at least some of the

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,250
time that you are spending on the

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,560
project by far the most popular method

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,390
is to sell support contracts but this

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,250
can be really hit or miss small

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,920
companies often can't afford anything

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,740
that takes away from their launch window

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,350
excuse me and big projects just think

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,550
we'll supporting ourselves internally

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,050
examples of support contracts there's a

00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,480
lot of them but my sequel and Java are

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,370
two particularly popular ones sometimes

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,900
the project itself or the community that

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,760
stewards the project isn't really set up

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,470
to be a commercial entity so the

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,720
maintainer --zz will sort of split into

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,220
a bunch of smaller companies and they'll

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,230
sell support contracts and other

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,180
services through those but again with

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,680
the same idea of funding their work on

00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,790
the original project this is the

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,960
dominant model in the post rest

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,850
community for example there's no

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Postgres corporation but there are a

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,380
sort of fleet of smaller consulting

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,840
groups around Postgres and a lot of the

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,430
contributors work for those after

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,140
selling support the most common models

00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,490
are based around having an open core and

00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,230
then selling related closed source

00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,310
components or differently licensed

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,170
components that add additional

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,200
functionality to cater to specific use

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,430
case usually big enterprise software

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,170
sometimes there's clear places to add

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,450
these paid add-ons like big enterprises

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,850
love sam'l login they love cross team

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,130
recording etc but other times it can be

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,630
difficult to find a place to sell these

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,040
features without harming your open

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,600
source users in one way or another

00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,190
something very popular the devops space

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,400
so chef buffets Alton ansible will all

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,410
sell commercial add-ons

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,580
dual licensing is a special case where

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,380
you sell the same software they could

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,000
get for free but under different license

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,370
terms so the common case is you have a

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,170
copyleft based project somebody wants to

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,370
fork and modify it but they don't want

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,990
to make the patches available so they

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,030
purchase a license from you that doesn't

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,860
have the copyleft restrictions it's not

00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,330
very common these days QT is probably

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,990
the best example of somebody still using

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,790
this similar sewing support contracts is

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,740
professional services this usually some

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,200
mix of consulting to help them best use

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,820
or deploy your product customizations

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
making custom plugins custom

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,690
modifications to the project for that

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,820
customer or hosting if it contains a

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,130
server component again examples too

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,660
numerous to list but pivotal software is

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,510
a big one they sell services around

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,950
Cloud Foundry grants have been a

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,780
mainstay of the academic world since

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,160
time immemorial and we're slowly seeing

00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,470
more of them available for software

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,640
projects like with other kinds of grants

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,110
you write a list of things you want to

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,059
do why you think they're important how

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,200
long do you think that'll take and use

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,760
that's coming with a dollar amounts and

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,280
you go and ask someone for that money

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm sure the PSF wasn't the first offer

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,940
open-source grants for the first that I

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,559
ran into a lot of other groups have

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,360
copied them in the Python ecosystem the

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,390
offer project-specific or ecosystem

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,550
specific grants going a bit out from

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,290
that the moss grants programmer Missoula

00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,750
grants more in general are another

00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,309
example they revenue ecosystem specific

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,380
they're looking for anything that helps

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,840
with Mozilla's foundational mission of

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,580
improving the open web and then one step

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,350
yet broader places like Google's open

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,940
source programs office they have a

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,650
mandate to support basically every

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,660
project that Google uses that's

00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,929
basically all of them at the scale of

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,280
Google a big problem with grants like

00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,590
with VC funding or any other

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,730
non-renewable income stream it's highly

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,260
dependent on how good your time

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,090
estimates were if it turns out that you

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,200
missed some complex requirements and it

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,970
takes you an extra six weeks to complete

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,440
the project that might end up coming out

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,210
of your own project or the project might

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,460
fail we all know that engineers are

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,100
super great at estimation right

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,600
so we reached the option most people go

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,490
with if you like this how about sending

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,420
me a few bucks on PayPal this is so

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,490
common I want to dive into some

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,620
specifics so the simplest solution

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,190
straight up tip jar on PayPal or venmo

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,680
or Bitcoin if you like that real easy to

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,730
set up but also very rarely useful it

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,860
can be heartening to get a few dollars

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,050
every now and then but if you're not

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,700
okay with working for free anyway it's

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,160
probably not going to help on the like

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,600
actually funding your time approach as a

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,950
maintainer I'd much rather a nicely

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,840
worded thank-you email from one of my

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:48,350
users than like five dollars from one

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,820
person once a more stable solution is

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,290
some kind of recurring donation so this

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,610
lets you plan out how much income you'll

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,070
have for the month so you can figure out

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,450
how much time you're gonna allocate

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,400
patreon basically owns this market right

00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,660
now but they haven't really reached out

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,550
of the software world so it can be a

00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,350
little bit difficult to get people aware

00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,330
that your patreon exists and they don't

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,010
really have support for corporate giving

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,680
very well so it can be difficult to get

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,030
donations from companies which leads

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,330
into a problem that I think both

00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,740
recurring and one-time donations share

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:17,780
basically it almost always ends up being

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,220
friends paying each other rather than

00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,610
the companies that are deriving economic

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,560
benefit from my software donating to me

00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,360
in general I don't want individual users

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,370
to ever feel like they owe me for my

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,900
software what I want is the companies

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,520
that are making money off it to get some

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,310
of those resources back to me so that we

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,150
can both benefit okay some other

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,470
donation options

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,480
I did actually run the Kickstarter to

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,340
fund some open source work it was

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,110
successful technically but it was

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,730
extremely stressful and I really

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,040
wouldn't recommend it like I mentioned

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,050
with grants I miss estimated Meg I miss

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,270
estimated my timeline by about three

00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,620
months and Kickstarter is like a grant

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,270
the amount of money you have is they not

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,180
only you have you get it once and you

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,380
better hope that that was correct some

00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,940
midsize projects that are looking to

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,260
temp donations from companies rather

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,520
than people will try to get a non-profit

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,490
status so their donations can be

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,930
tax-exempt at least in the US but

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,520
creating a non-profit come scratch is

00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,830
really hard and I don't really recommend

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,480
it so it's usually a better bet to join

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,040
an umbrella group someone that already

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,990
has nonprofit status and fin accept

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,160
donations on your behalf especially one

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,940
I highly the great work of software

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,680
freedom Conservancy

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,350
they've helped dozens of projects set up

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,400
this umbrella donations system if you're

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,810
interested in doing that for any of your

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,440
projects I highly recommend talking to

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,790
them

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,310
got a contact form on their website for

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,870
it outside of the simple logistical

00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,400
issues a common problem with donations

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,450
is working out how to divide them if

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,010
there's more than one maintainer

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,630
sometimes you can sidestep this by

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,910
spending the donations on project level

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,150
resources like server hosting or buying

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:44,060
t-shirts or whatever but it can very

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,620
easily lead to hurt feelings or perverse

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,100
incentives and the project if you end up

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,390
paying like by the line or by the commit

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,310
what money makes the world go round many

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,710
donations take the form of discounted or

00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,450
free credits to services so for example

00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,800
Rackspace has very graciously hosted

00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,900
part of the CI infrastructure for my

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,550
chef cookbooks for many years it's often

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,800
easier to ask a company to donate

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,570
whatever they their service or their

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,980
product is then to go and ask them for

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:11,840
money this is less common but more

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,010
interesting funding strategies various

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,910
projects have tried to fund themselves

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,530
by selling books

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,360
I must go to believe the Lua language

00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,100
did this but it can be really difficult

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,690
line to walk because you still need some

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,220
free documentation if anyone's gonna use

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,170
your project so you have to figure out

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,520
how to balance those often times these

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,160
days and ends up being the book is

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,230
available online for free but hard

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,990
copies are available for purchase but

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,130
that'll severely impact your revenue

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,390
selling ad space can theoretically be a

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,800
very lucrative option that sells

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,640
basically run the entire world these

00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,650
days right

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,000
setting up Google ads on a website is

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,960
super easy to get started with but

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,780
doesn't actually bring in very much

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,330
revenue negotiating your own direct ad

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,620
deals can bring in a lot more money and

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,880
give you a lot more control over what

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,290
ads you show but it's very time

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,480
consuming and difficult to get those

00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,560
kinds of things set up and it all might

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,790
be for an office if you're highly

00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,120
technical audience are all using ad

00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,470
blockers anyway but bounties are most

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,940
common in the infra second world as a

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,280
tool try to incentivize people away from

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,110
selling bug reports and attacks to the

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,210
bad guys but they're starting to appear

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,830
for normal software other other non

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,110
security related things like normal

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,460
features or bug reports but they're

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,290
probably still too rare to really

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,460
qualify as a sustainable funding source

00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,770
maybe we'll see this get better in the

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,050
future

00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,580
we're coops are really deep rabbit hole

00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,900
and they all run differently but we're

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,880
starting to see something based on open

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,670
source I'm snow drift and tide lifts are

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,290
both getting more interest but we'll see

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,200
over time if they are successful I think

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,190
right now it's still too early to say

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,080
and so we look further out in the future

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,220
with science medicine in the arts

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,990
there's a lot of national and even

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,990
international organizations that provide

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:43,030
funding for stuff like basic research

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:45,429
basic research in science is things that

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,110
do not really have direct rewards

00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:49,120
immediately but they form the basis for

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,559
future work that sounds a lot like a lot

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,210
of infrastructure level open-source

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,650
projects so maybe one day we could see a

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,540
National Institute of software there's

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,710
some government grants available here

00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,740
and there but it's not really a

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,570
coordinated system and if I can dream

00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,400
really really big a universal basic

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,870
income would allow people to spend time

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,280
building things they think are important

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,950
even though the market doesn't directly

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,390
value them hopefully by now I have

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,770
convinced you that sustainable software

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,970
is important and you've got some ideas

00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,940
brewing for how we can all move in that

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,350
direction but what can we do now as I

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,450
stressed before the enemy of open source

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,670
is most often burn out not technical

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,040
failings practice embassy practice

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,600
empathy both while using and maintaining

00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,600
open source software and it can help a

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,300
lot if you make money using open source

00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,380
which is almost every company these days

00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,090
be on the lookout for ways you can help

00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,700
or donate to projects that you depend

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,710
heavily on and most of all always be

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,809
ready for change maybe the only

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,280
maintainer of a critical library for you

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,630
I'll have a kid and decide they don't

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,790
really care about writing open-source

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,100
anymore that's okay

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,780
maybe you maintain a library or a tool

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,490
or something and you get a new job and

00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,130
you decide yeah that thing that's just

00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,710
not fun anymore that's okay and maybe

00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,410
the entire ecosystem will change maybe

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,730
the the daos on the blockchain will

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,340
actually take off and that'll be how we

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,900
write all software forever that's okay

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,950
too I don't believe that last one is

00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,900
going to happen but that's a different

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,340
talk we've all only been writing

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,200
software like this for a couple of

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,820
decades we have a lot to learn about how

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,770
to do it properly

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,930
thank you very much there's too many

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,520
people that I can thank if I had time

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,290
for their advice and wisdom over the

00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,120
years for how to run sustainable

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,040
projects but I'd like to extend initials

00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,960
extra special thanks to Nadia Russell

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,790
and Eric as true luminaries of the space

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,280
highly recommend all of their writings

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,660
if you're interested in diving deeper

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,980
and we have a few minutes for questions

00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,980
depending on when we're supposed to end

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:47,440
when we supposed to be done just so I

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:49,570
keep my eye on the clock okay someone

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,370
contributing to like a 10 plus year old

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,790
projects that with multiple contributors

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:57,040
I'm kind of throwing out burnouts about

00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,030
like oh I don't want to change this I

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,210
might break

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,710
I can probably break users I mean the

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,020
only thing I can think of is just try to

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,790
have both you know a long-term support

00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:11,290
version and a branch and actually

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,740
develop branch do you have any other

00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,630
advice unless someone is paying you you

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,510
do not owe them long-term support I mean

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,910
if your project is robust enough and has

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,610
the maintainer backing to support an LCS

00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:27,610
release that's great but otherwise just

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:31,600
don't I mean yes users will be annoyed

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:33,310
but like you have to factor in what is

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,890
going to be best for you as a maintainer

00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:39,220
has a group of maintained errs and like

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:41,050
you don't owe your users that much it's

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,130
it is important but it's not that

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,130
important thank you

00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:53,960
that's just a footnote on that it isn't

00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,290
necessarily a binary thing yeah I mean

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,510
rails for instance is you know pretty

00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,920
you know is more aggressive than a lot

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,410
of people would be about you know

00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:07,430
ditching features that no longer seemed

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,960
like a good idea but what they do is you

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,620
know with what they do is to deprecate

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,910
and delete on a schedule mm-hmm thank

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:19,370
you but you know that is a good approach

00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,410
but users will still be mad one of the

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,440
projects that I maintain we went two

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,360
years to a half years doing no breaking

00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,190
releases because we were very worried

00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,630
that our users were gonna get and it was

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,760
terrible we're never doing it again ever

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,410
felt like the users loved it but

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,940
basically all of them maintainer said if

00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,070
anyone ever suggests this again we're

00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,050
all quitting because there was so much

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,820
technical debt to clean up at the end of

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,000
those two and a half years that we were

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,500
all basically drowning in it and in the

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,100
end I think it wasn't actually better

00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:52,100
for users like burning out and making

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,630
all of your maintainer hate their job is

00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,160
not actually in the best interest of

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,600
users even if they think in the short

00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,750
term that they would rather not have

00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,890
breaking changes so it's it's I think a

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,790
lot about communication and

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,790
communicating expectations

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,710
questions awesome well thank you very

00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,710
much and enjoy the rest of Def Con

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,480
