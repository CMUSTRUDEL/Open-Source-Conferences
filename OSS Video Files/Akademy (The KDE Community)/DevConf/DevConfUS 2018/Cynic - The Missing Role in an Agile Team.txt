Title: Cynic - The Missing Role in an Agile Team
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	We realized that our team was focusing mostly on building the product correctly and a very less or in most of the cases no emphasis was laid out on building the correct product.  We then altered our QE strategy into a three role approach called Primary Secondary and Cynic.

And a Cynic is a someone who shields himself from the project related discussions and based on 'lack of proximity' to the developers, he/she can be very blunt while providing feedback. Is closer to the end user.

Works with a mindset of 'guilty until proven innocent '.

nice talk to choose title signify Missy

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,179
low in technology and of course our

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,179
president

00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:37,030
all right am i audible and the back so

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:46,879
my name is Deepak I'm and chewie

00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:49,820
basically and I started in 2007 this was

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,809
there when the global economic recession

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,269
also started incidentally and the and

00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,670
this selenium and the webdriver projects

00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:03,190
also merged which would then go on to

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:06,680
become the de facto web testing standard

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,470
so I did five years in PTC which is

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,690
parametric technology and before coming

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,830
to Boston I was not aware that PTC's

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,569
headquartered 19 miles from here and

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,179
after that I did six years in that hat

00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:23,509
and I've been doing the same thing for

00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:25,880
last 11 years like accepting user

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,549
stories writing automated test cases and

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,789
finding bugs so you will say it is a

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,940
monotonous monotonous job right but if

00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:38,709
you have an eye for it it throws a bit

00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,709
of nuances and challenges every day

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:49,570
all right anyone in this room whose

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,570
responsibility is the software quality

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,650
alright so there are a couple of people

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,450
who fell in this trap so this was

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,729
already discussed in one of the earlier

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,570
sessions that quality is everyone's

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,570
responsibility

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:12,370
and the ideal recipe so the my talk is

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,489
is an agile recipe so it is only fair

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,860
that I give you the disclaimer that the

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,890
most important ingredient of any agile

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,620
the CP is the is the people which

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,560
practice that success recipe right so

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,629
you cannot copy a successful agile

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,480
recipe and paste it on this different

00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,450
demon expect similar results so it can

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:40,329
either do really well better than this

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,769
other team or fail really bad all right

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,400
so let's start with the heartbreaking

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:49,480
story so has anyone seen this progress

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:53,319
bar on a web page it lab has it okay so

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:57,180
it was back four years ago I was working

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,180
on a user story and

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,980
it was a ticket management tool single

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,010
page web apps ticket management tool

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,990
which had let's say hundreds of fields

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,630
and out of those hundreds of fields to

00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,000
word the fields which used to be polled

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:18,430
regularly because we had to show users

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,670
the correct data a very updated data so

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,620
what we usually what we used to do till

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,830
that time was we used to discreetly

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,720
update those two fields by pulling in

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,290
making two Network calls in the backend

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,980
without telling the user so in that

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,350
sprint there came a enhancement request

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,920
that you need to give users a visual

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,880
clue that you are fetching the fresh

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,210
data for those two particular fields so

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,650
my developer friend use this JavaScript

00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,570
library I really liked it because it it

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,200
was on git lab it was on my favorite

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,630
e-commerce site so I thought it was cool

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,390
so

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:06,270
as a QE I tested on different browsers

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,180
because JavaScript and then I did

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:13,260
regression tests as well and one Friday

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,840
morning Eastern Time and unfortunately

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,280
the Friday evening India time we

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,070
released it and I had this habit like

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,740
teenagers when they put their cute

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,190
selfies on Facebook or Instagram they

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,260
refresh the feed to see how many likes

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,200
so after every release I had this habit

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,900
of you know monitoring emails IRC as

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,890
well as the bugzilla feed to see whether

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,870
there is some backlash or not till 30

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,870
minutes there was nothing and after 30

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,870
minutes there was a huge outrage

00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:56,349
these are not the actual clippings I

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:58,529
just made there was a huge outrage so

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:03,189
everyone said that this is a usability

00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:06,129
disaster this is not this change this

00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:09,550
particularly loader is distracting us

00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:13,389
from working and if we do not work on

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:18,430
cases read that loses business so we

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:22,120
quickly diverted the change and to bring

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:26,199
back the sameness in the system and then

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,960
we like every team we had a Tatro and

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:33,310
out of the retro everyone said that this

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,520
happens we could not we could not gauge

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,199
the user behavior right we thought it

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,610
was a good way of implementing this

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:45,610
change but we could not so we actually

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,879
brushed it under the carpet but then I

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,639
did a retro with myself

00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,529
so I'll explain in another slide that

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,569
the retro which you do with your inner

00:05:53,529 --> 00:06:00,449
self is the beste Trevor

00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:05,690
so this was the struggle so this is the

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:08,000
user support engineers in our case

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,310
and this is the tweak and this is the

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,280
developer if you look at these three

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,750
categories of people which two are more

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,090
likely to go for a dinner together or

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:24,320
maybe share a laugh or go ante mounting

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:27,230
like QA and welfare right because they

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,080
have that team bond proximity and

00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,490
because of that proximity which is a

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,560
psychological thing where you cannot

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:40,130
change it because of that proximity what

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,160
QE does normally in agile teams is they

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,830
test the change they don't test why we

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,130
why did the why did the developer

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:52,010
implement that code change right so very

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:56,300
existing shy question but Q is mostly

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:58,790
failed to do that and more so in today's

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,040
time when we don't have traditional q is

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,200
right every q is also a developer of

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,160
some different kinds so right they are

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,980
writing code day in and day out right so

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,410
once you see a piece of code on your

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,320
developer friends machine your mind

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,720
becomes biased so now you have three

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,940
ways of breaking that code which we have

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,790
already seen but it's not a black box to

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,440
you now so there are there were hundred

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,310
other ways of breaking that code which

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,310
you will miss now

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,280
then we thought about why don't why

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,189
don't we do one thing why don't we bring

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,249
fresher perspective into the Q eating so

00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:42,759
the same work stream we bought another

00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:46,330
to eat right but without making any

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:50,110
capacity changes so there was user story

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,330
one there were user story - and there

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,240
was first q en sir primary QE and second

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,729
degree so primary key we will work on

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,669
user story one for 50% of his time and

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:03,029
on user story - for 50% of his time and

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:07,319
the same thing second degree we will do

00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:09,750
so because no two people think alike I

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,330
haven't made it up it is neuroscience

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:16,900
our mind is connected like our

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:20,560
fingerprints it's different so different

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,360
people perceive things differently so if

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,699
you look at crowdsourcing testing

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,180
platforms which have you know boomed up

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:30,669
recently they exploit this thing so they

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,409
they'll take a website and throw it to

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,409
500 testers all over the globe

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,400
so we thought that this will at least

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:47,140
make some improvement in our process it

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:49,060
did but there was still a gap because to

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,660
work in the system both the queue is

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:56,380
needed to attend all scrum ceremonies

00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,730
like daily standup planning retro

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:03,250
everything and the proximity challenge

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,750
which the primary earlier had the same

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,980
thing happened with the secondary has

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:13,000
done right then we came up with a new

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,090
thing called cynic the cynic is someone

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,120
who is not part of this work stream a

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,250
completely different person of maybe a

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,680
different project or someone else on the

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,920
base right

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,510
so what does cynic do so how do you feel

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,460
the first thing is how do you find a

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,440
cynic so these are the qualities of a

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,720
cynic cynics will not belong to your

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,720
works team or project which means that

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,050
he shielded from the project little

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,360
discussions right the cynic should be

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,589
naturally a vocal and a 30-percent so we

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,690
don't need to make any any effort on

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,680
finding these people in red hair type

00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:00,100
and the third and most important thing

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,600
it should be willing to help again in

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,220
Red Hat you will find because people

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,960
will contribute to different projects so

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,670
you will you will find cynics and then

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,210
if you don't find then you have to

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,210
incentivize

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,300
now what does a cynic do Sydney gives a

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,300
very fresh and mostly end-user

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,430
perspective to your work because he's

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,430
not he's not seen the code right it has

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,550
not been part of planning or grooming or

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:37,010
scrum so he is looking at your changes

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:39,320
as a user and cynic is your

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,769
accountability and if we go back to this

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,260
line but we have to do is we have to

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:52,610
nudge this person from here to slightly

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:54,440
right and cynic does that energy is the

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,490
primary secondary towards the building

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,490
the right product side

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,370
now the takeaways from this talk

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:14,730
so if you look at what happened with

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,670
after that incident that usability

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,589
incident first we tried to introduce a

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,300
secondary tester right then we

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:27,149
identified the gaps then we tried to

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,790
implement a signature so we were

00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,010
constantly improving finding gaps and

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,770
improving the system which is the

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:39,779
essence of an agile team and then again

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,580
the thing which I said earlier best

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,339
retrospectives are the ones which you do

00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,920
with your inner self right because the

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,610
actual rate receptacles retrospectives

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,610
are very formal

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:56,399
the third thing that you can do is you

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,429
can sign up a cynic you can find a

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,479
person in your Bay who is not part of

00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:09,119
your project and ask him if if he can

00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:12,749
give 30 minutes per week to you and see

00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:15,689
if it works for you as I said this is a

00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:17,699
recipe it can work for you can work

00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:22,769
better for you then it works for us

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:25,109
because in our team we have this we have

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:28,259
a UI workstream committee of extreme

00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:31,079
services work stream so the qe working

00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,239
in UI work stream automatically become

00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,789
natural cynics off because they are the

00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:40,979
consumers of the service Li right they

00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:43,760
become natural cynics of the service

00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:46,730
layer work stream

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,760
so what you can do is you can find a

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:54,260
cynic a very assertive and vocal person

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,740
and try to sign it sign him up for your

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,740
project

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,760
and some physical takeaway so if you

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,100
look at this different carrying dude

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,740
back I have bought this three of them

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:12,000
from the mountains of Kashmir in the

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:16,920
north of India so I actually want the

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,550
feedback for this so but for that I'm

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,550
incentivizing so

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,940
sorry are you taking the process light

00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:33,870
by

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:37,110
maybe but right now I just want feedback

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:41,250
for this talk so who uses this hashtag

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:45,240
you can take the photos so who uses the

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:50,180
this tag hash tag in next 30 minutes and

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,320
provides a tweet as a feedback and

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,210
because I have bought them with my

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,450
hard-earned money so I will choose the

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,750
best tweets and I will give away these

00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,750
bags

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,650
all right any questions

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:26,220
a great talk I really enjoyed the cynic

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,680
as part of the team and like that aspect

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,200
to it but I noticed that there was a bit

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,990
of a similarity between the secondary QA

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,880
and the cynic because you're pulling in

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,519
an engineer for know some of the ladies

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,350
know similarity between cynic and second

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,220
because I can be QA is part of your work

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:47,339
stream so he has to attend your scrum

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:52,320
ceremonies but it doesn't the cynic also

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:54,540
to know so for cynic you have to the

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,829
only interface between your project and

00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,560
cynic is the primary way so just like

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:04,490
code review you get you write your code

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,370
you get your code reviewed from your

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,620
buddy developer right so let's say all

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,820
the stuff which was developed came on

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,890
the QA environment now I have to test it

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,800
what if before testing I demoed to a

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,699
cynic to get a fresher perspective

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,199
30 minutes for per sprint it's not much

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:29,399
to ask for

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:32,610
so my secondary question so if QA

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,490
chooses a single cynic and like

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,680
frequently demos with them apps for some

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,990
point they're going to become buddies

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,660
and so they're gonna have to find a new

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,060
cynic and so so maybe maybe redhead

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,190
won't have this problem but at smaller

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,810
companies they might have trouble

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:54,149
finding enough cynics to see if primary

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,760
QA and cynic become buddies that's okay

00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,950
that won't make any difference I

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,960
because it does not put any bias in

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:04,080
cynics mind towards the work which

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,100
developers are doing right if they're

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,710
buddies I think there's going to be a

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:14,610
little bit of but is it you right the

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:17,970
job of QA was initially to start with to

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:21,470
bring the code right but then we went

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:25,350
into simply the rubble stamping the code

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:29,340
so we need see if you if you go to the

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:32,160
game right that the most imp a common

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,410
example of accountability partner is the

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,270
weight loss thing right you start with

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,860
weight loss you make a new new a

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,400
resolution you start with weight loss

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,860
and over a period of time let's say by a

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,280
third January you stuff going to gym

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,110
right but if there are two people who

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,750
who are each other's accountability

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:55,230
partners then there are chances that

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,090
this weight loss resolution will go till

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,600
March

00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,600
made of happily

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,060
thank you

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,060
any other questions

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,429
feedback

00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,839
me

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,839
yeah

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,080
all right thank you everyone thank you

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,429
for your time don't forget about the

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,440
bags I do not want to take them back

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:36,440
because I have done shopping from Boston

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,900
no really

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,520
