Title: Cynic - The Missing Role in an Agile Team
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	We realized that our team was focusing mostly on building the product correctly and a very less or in most of the cases no emphasis was laid out on building the correct product.  We then altered our QE strategy into a three role approach called Primary Secondary and Cynic.

And a Cynic is a someone who shields himself from the project related discussions and based on 'lack of proximity' to the developers, he/she can be very blunt while providing feedback. Is closer to the end user.

Works with a mindset of 'guilty until proven innocent '.
