Description: 
	Ever found yourself wanting to add authentication to an application but dreading writing all that code to deal with OAuth or passwords?

In this session, we'll cover using the nginx auth_request module to quickly add authentication to any service you're running without writing code. Lasso, a microservice written in Go, handles the OAuth dance to any number of different auth providers so you don't have to.

We'll cover using nginx + Lasso for a few different use cases:

* protecting an internal application by limiting logins to people in your company
* protecting an external application by requiring users authente
* running a application with public access and optionally authenticating users

You should be familiar with basic configuration of nginx to get the most out of this talk.
