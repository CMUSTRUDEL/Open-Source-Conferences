Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly, active users - more than active users of the internet in 2000. Humans create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. Massively scalable systems and massive amounts of data are now part of every developer’s life even if you don’t work at a Silicon Valley unicorn.

Reactive approaches are critical pieces in scaling modern systems and effectively working with distributed applications. Reactive approaches are particularly important in microservices architectures. 

This talk covers the origins of reactive Java at Netflix with ReactiveX, reactive systems with Eclipse Vert.x, Akka and Spring Reactor, and a bit of Reactive JavaScript while playing with marbles.
