Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Saron Yitbarek (founder of CodeNewbie) and Chris Wright (Red Hat CTO) will interview each other on a few topics. We will start with why and how they got in to software, why they are still in software, and why they want to stay. Next we will move on to, how to increase inclusion in software. Finally, they will discuss their perceptions of the impact of the tech revolution on the disadvantaged. Oh, but wait, the moderator will step in and ask, so what are *you* doing to make an impact? As time permits, the audience will be solicited for more questions.
