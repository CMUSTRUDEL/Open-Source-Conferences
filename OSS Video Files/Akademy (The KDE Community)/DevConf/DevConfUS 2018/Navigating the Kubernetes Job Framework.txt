Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	With ChRIS, a radiology project built in collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital, Red Hat, and the Mass Open Cloud, we've had the opportunity to develop an application which utilizes OpenShift/Kubernetes jobs at scale. As part of this session, we'll examine the options available in the Kubernetes job framework and how the various options applied to our use cases.


- The options available in the kube job framework
- The options we considered using and their pros and cons as they applied to our use case.
- Future use cases we have for the job framework
- What should be added to the job framework. Ex: a count of workers passed to each pod and an order assigned to each pod
