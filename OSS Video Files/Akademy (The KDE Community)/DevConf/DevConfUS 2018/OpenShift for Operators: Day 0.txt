Title: OpenShift for Operators: Day 0
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	OpenShift is an Open Source distribution of Kubernetes, with additional capabilities including advanced network management, container repositories, role based access control, storage management, metrics and logging, app lifecycle management, self-service, capacity management, and much more.

In this session, Red Hat's Thomas Cameron will demonstrate how operations can get OpenShift up and running and ready for developers to start using. We'll discuss host considerations including building VM templates, installation using Ansible, system roles and recommendations, and so on. At the end of the session, operators will be able to deploy a moderately complex OpenShift environment.
