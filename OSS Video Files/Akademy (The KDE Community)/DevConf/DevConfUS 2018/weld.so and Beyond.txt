Description: 
	What if we didn't need packaging anymore? What if we could produce working system images in milliseconds? What if every system had atomic updates and perfect rollback? What if we never had to scan or rebuild container images? What if every process ran in its own dynamically-generated container? In this talk, Will Woods gives a brief of Project Weldr's long-term vision for the future of images and containers, and what it's going to take to make these things possible.
