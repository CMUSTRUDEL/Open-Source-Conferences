Description: 
	BlkKin is a custom end-to-end tracing infrastructure for Ceph. It captures the work done to process individual requests within and among Ceph’s components. But, it can only be turned on for individual requests and cannot be left always-on due to the resulting overhead. We present Jaeger-BlkKin, which can be used in always-on fashion in production with low overhead. Jaeger-BlkKin is constructed by replacing much of Blkkin’s tracing functionality with that of Jaeger, a widely-deployed open source tracing infrastructure. Jaeger-Blkkin is OpenTracing compatible, meaning that it can be replaced easily with other, even more advanced tracing infrastructures when they become available.
