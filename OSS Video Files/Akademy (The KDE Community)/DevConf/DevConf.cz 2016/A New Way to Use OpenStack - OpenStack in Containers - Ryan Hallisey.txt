Title: A New Way to Use OpenStack - OpenStack in Containers - Ryan Hallisey
Publication date: 2016-02-11

Description: 
	OpenStack is a fast growing and complicated project that can run into issues because of its immense complexion, but now, containers have arrived on the scene and they are levelling the playing field. About a month ago, the Kolla project, a newly adopted project in OpenStack, completed its stable release of a containerized OpenStack installer powered by Ansible.

In this session, I would like to discuss how containers improve OpenStack and introduce the Kolla project with the goal of reducing the confusion and malaise that can sometimes come when installing and using a complex tool like OpenStack.
