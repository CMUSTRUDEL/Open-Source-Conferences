Title: Introduction to Linux Kernel Crash Analysis - Alex Juncu
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	As a Technical Support Engineer on the Kernel team, one of the top tools I need is kdump and crash, both used to determine the cause of a kernel crash.
In this presentation, I want to give an introduction on how kdump works and how it generates vmcores and how people can use crash to debug vmcores generated by kernel crashes.
I will demo some basic scenarios where kdump is useful and, if time permits, some more advanced debugging techniques.
