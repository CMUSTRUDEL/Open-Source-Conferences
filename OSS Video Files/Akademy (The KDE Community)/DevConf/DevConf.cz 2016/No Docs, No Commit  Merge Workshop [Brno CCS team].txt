Title: No Docs, No Commit  Merge Workshop [Brno CCS team]
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	When development and documentation efforts are coordinated, customer satisfaction is more likely.

This theatrical skit presents both failure and success scenarios (in that order) using an extended medieval metaphor. After the skit, we explain things briefly, comparing "no docs, no commit/merge" to "no test, no commit".

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,740
strongman do realize but seriously just

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,690
a few hours left if I fail my head my

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,640
body bereft about castles not much do I

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,810
know how you do my bath of the map

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,620
though but seriously just a few hours

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:40,660
left if I fail my head my body there

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:43,570
right the architect Unger's mmm two

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,960
wings or three wars always better surely

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,950
all can agreed this team biggest world a

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:55,030
dust begins to swell but there's some

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:59,380
wings fills the air old industry the

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:02,560
page fears through the dust but finds no

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,920
cooperation we don't want a conventional

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:11,080
and without any pretension he Google's

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:14,710
the word wings finds them paired a move

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:21,340
things and draws Matt to a two-week

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:25,390
mentioned by now it's mid-morning and

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:31,870
time for a coffee break the page grabs

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:35,500
the architects they chess so the wing

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,830
count is actually three is not obvious

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:44,190
to see

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:48,120
the things just not hands and so the day

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,360
progresses so fast the clocks by the

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:55,550
page struggles mightily to learn how

00:07:50,360 --> 00:08:00,770
wats and why changes when furiously

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:06,770
strangers standard Gillislee frustration

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:12,570
marks the pages step once deft and spry

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:17,550
now Castle seems raised hard to see in

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:20,610
the dust age the med seems drawn judging

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:28,500
from the pages days the clocks chime

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:37,500
five trumpets sound I the queen and then

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:44,970
arise but this week we are late because

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:48,470
nobody knows how to open the game and

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:53,540
what her leg gets in the sisters stuff

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,540
as shields fourth room she goes

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:04,820
now I need to prep for the neighbouring

00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:09,630
King who to this castle your complicity

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:18,630
but the info of the drawbridge to set is

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:22,530
updated to the caulking goes flat so the

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:26,960
Queen who's a foot down and says this

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,960
beside cool guards off with their heads

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,780
stop stop your efforts are great so this

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,660
way I find quite graceful so he don't

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,620
present my wisdom mouth I was not be to

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,110
need more sensational realize that in

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,500
this endeavor your life disease when you

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,500
work together

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:15,549
I command that only on open field for me

00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:19,720
a castle swiftly be built by 5pm sharp

00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:23,379
with many room as my minions are facing

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,199
their do now let's try one more time

00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,339
they seem to do but working together in

00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,339
our act too

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,569
a castle raised I can craft it with

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,199
closed eyes my teams they don drummond

00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:47,110
do realize you're now it occurs to me

00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:53,889
that with the page we should make sure

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:56,290
to be on the same page hey about castles

00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,259
I know not all that much so with the

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,350
builders I will keep in touch but

00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:09,939
seriously just a few hours left if we

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:11,980
fail our heads our bodies draft hmm two

00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:32,259
wings or three moles always better

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:36,850
surely all can agree the page reads the

00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:39,910
note by partial comprehension so here it

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,389
is natural and without any pretension he

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:46,779
pulls over twins find some guys who some

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:50,949
buildings and draw the plans to renewing

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:56,819
adventure and so on the day progresses

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:56,819
how far the fox five page manage acidity

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:04,590
changes and furiously makers

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:11,450
halation is the basic food is it won't

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:14,730
ever try writing each note both

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:19,050
terrified young vigilante he ponders our

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,440
laws ideas that's less wacky designs us

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:27,540
is happy here boys we work and then

those time sucking balls now has indeed

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:37,970
taste your dust in degrees error the map

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:37,970
is over

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:04,460

I'm your guy hello America I write

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,690
mostly for platform virtualization and

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,690
I'm also the resident crazy cat person

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:39,890
hi I'm kinky I write for open shift I'm

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,160
also responsible for the rest of this

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:46,480
presentation so here's what's going to

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,490
happen next we this is a workshop in

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,100
theory so we're going to work this means

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,110
we are going to talk this means you are

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,030
going to talk this means we're going to

00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,230
talk together what are we going to talk

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:03,530
about we have three things we have first

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:06,380
of all we just presented a play this is

00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,300
a an extended metaphor so what we're

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,410
going to do is first unravel it what

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,870
does it mean what is

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,060
mean to you what does it mean to us I I

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,649
think we used language in the play at

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,680
perhaps a little bit difficult to

00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,690
understand and perhaps the metaphors

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,470
we're not clear so let's talk about that

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:30,000
first then after that we'll touch on

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:32,899
what is no docs no commit / merge which

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,430
is the title of this presentation and

00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,930
after that we'll discuss if we have

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,389
anything else to discuss what this stuff

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:46,439
in between there will be a break as he

00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:48,500
Tina said at so that would be a good

00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:51,269
time to escape and get some lunch and

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:56,040
stay away if you don't want to come back

00:15:51,269 --> 00:16:00,810
ok no obligation ok so let's talk about

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,089
the play in the in the beginning of the

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:10,740
play I think on my in 15 if you consult

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:16,250
your then there's a question it right

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,250
the HP bar oh this is a question can you

00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:27,519
the walls for trades

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:30,130
three primary role to the architect and

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,760
the page so these are obviously

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,829
sometimes related to know Doc's know

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,510
commit right so what do you think

00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:46,529
anybody volunteer yes I mean what are

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:46,529
those roles what are the analogies ruled

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:29,140
ranging in the program oh okay that's

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:33,970
very close what does it produce okay and

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,530
then so what is the right so let's see

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,610
we have the Queen Paige architect

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:41,140
customer technical writer developer

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,809
let's go back and forth so that you can

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,799
kind of get that into your head right go

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:53,440
back go forward okay so these are the

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:56,169
main metaphors for this and now we're

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,750
going to go forward and think about the

00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:03,929
other metaphors okay we have all what

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,929
else is what else what does the very

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:20,640
yes so together what you said what did

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,640
she do

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:40,730
yes she's the manager she well yeah I

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:47,100
guess in some sense she's my peer yeah

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:51,150
hi she represents the wisdom of working

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:54,590
together because oftentimes what what

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,590
does the beep leave our second

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,100
maybe Bart what did you say initially

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,740
what was your premise in terms of like

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,660
right so a small plane was correct as

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:13,290
bad some like this to those who really

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:17,430
cares right but before that right Oh

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:23,160
holes so first day by trying to all set

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:26,850
it takes skill to make that Porsche and

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:31,410
that's brilliant slow getting create

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:34,620
folders right so basically we have an

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,780
idea that and this is kind of a myth

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,540
that supported in society is that like

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:44,460
you can be brilliant you can have talent

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:46,260
and you can loneguy hacker in the

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,370
basement or in the garage or wherever

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:54,150
can create a new bill gates nada there's

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:59,550
a lot of individualism and this kind of

00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:03,630
thing is a very strong underlying

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:06,660
message that the wisdom of the very few

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,929
who is perhaps a manager or perhaps

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,490
somebody who has experience in having

00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:18,059
people work together

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:21,150
manager corrects by giving the architect

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,170
and the page a means of communication

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,370
right so the communication and

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,390
structuring the communication is

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:34,440
important that's okay other metaphors

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:37,470
let's see other or let's just turn the

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,980
page and say was there anything not

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,559
clearing the plate we try to use really

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:51,179
fancy language is there anything that

00:20:42,559 --> 00:21:03,390
you don't understand you want it's like

00:20:51,179 --> 00:21:09,809
yahoo but you know there's a dragon back

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:15,890
there waiting for you okay altavista

00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:15,890
okay all right so other questions

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,810
okay so what you're telling me is the

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,710
play was completely clear everything was

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:34,420
perfect and you just want me to continue

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:38,560
get on but all right yeah we did a good

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:43,960
job good job okay all right let's now

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,430
turn to because yeah let's let turn to

00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,490
the next slide which is what is

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,020
technical writing ok because

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:57,450
documentation is technical writing and

00:21:50,020 --> 00:22:01,450
so here we ask people in the audience

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:06,120
that's you to tell us what is technical

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:13,840
writer ok and we're going to do this

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:15,010
we're gonna get some answers now is the

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,530
time to raise your hand and say

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:23,530
something and next slide please this is

00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:26,830
in your experience in ime is in my

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:30,310
experience and I am h/o is in my humble

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,750
opinion ok so then really what what do

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,370
you think about technical writing what

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,080
do you think about what technical

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:42,220
writers do the template for this is that

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,460
you say hi I'm brave I'm going to say to

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,850
my role I am a blah blah and this is

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:56,590
what I think ok so yeah I know this

00:22:48,850 --> 00:23:01,230
guy's growing up you want to start if

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,230
you started doing on it ok hi

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:16,600
my humble being taken right on going to

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:24,580
get meaningful information will then be

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:27,220
some form okay thank you so I have an

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,300
intermediary role and the key word that

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:35,470
I heard from you was it's a struggle did

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,320
I got it to you yes that's in your

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,910
example traductor to get information

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:53,110
from the engineers into some form that

00:23:41,910 --> 00:24:02,020
this easy understandable because I try

00:23:53,110 --> 00:24:04,300
that my hair used to be smooth ok so

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,640
that's one okay let's get at least five

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,680
ok I'm not going to go forward until we

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,680
get at least five people ok

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:54,750
so basically in my opinion it's bright

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,750
like prescription of the product

00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,460
knowledge

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:18,440
okay so if I understand correctly you

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:30,100
say it is my teaching me that by someone

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:30,100
who knows documentation but not just

00:25:51,220 --> 00:26:05,440
and I sorry but on the other hand I have

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:08,590
to say that if you know too much on the

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:30,400
product you do not see exactly what the

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:34,059
user actually compromised so yes

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,580
technical knowledge but it's very

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:45,039
important to have some other point of

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:50,190
view so if I can surmise then I think

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:58,740
that you're over this is we have to

00:26:50,190 --> 00:27:06,130
elevate this kind there's another kind

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:10,720
but don't do it okay you say that it is

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:15,990
possible to have an extreme knowledge

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,990
like to close not so much

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:53,120
in terms of not having somebody else is

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:56,960
over the powerpoint on the right hi I'm

00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:07,220
Steven yes our contention services at I

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:08,840
headed I'm a weaver bridge gaps and my

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,800
mind oh sh about technical writing

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,940
business bringing order to chaos bring

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:24,460
order to chaos that's really a simple

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:24,460
oks very straight I can summarize it

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:36,830
look up I'm being rigorous okay I have

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:40,660
to do this I say you are o bring hot

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,660
builder Bridget built you said Weaver

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:51,890
rachela bridge made of so a bridge

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:54,470
builder / Weaver and you think that

00:28:51,890 --> 00:29:00,070
technical writing is bringing order to

00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,070
chaos right

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,460
well bringing order to chaos that's okay

00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:09,259
interesting well talk about that we'll

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,070
have some beer to still have some beer

00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:15,799
is about it yes please my name is Shawn

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:27,159
I agree with everything Stephen said but

00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:30,649
I must say I work in the documentation

00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:38,690
discipline discipline but strictly with

00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:44,749
upstream open source projects and in my

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:48,409
opinion which is not a good way to

00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:49,940
survive is about taking a large amount

00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,590
of information a huge wealth of

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:59,049
information a brain dump from your

00:29:51,590 --> 00:30:01,899
engineers chaos and organizing it

00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:05,990
strategizing how its presented and

00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:08,350
making it so that users can quickly and

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:14,629
easily find the piece of information

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:17,529
okay so I to summarize you also work in

00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:17,529
content services

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:53,410
just like hearing echoes at this reward

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:53,410
cast but there is an additional layer of

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:07,700
x as as an upstream focus person up

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:10,250
strange I've used for you sir right well

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,260
whoever would this is another

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:18,080
controversial ward right consume the

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:21,260
documentation this is so basically you

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:28,070
want to make it easy and effective for

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:32,480
them okay great so then we have a bunch

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:34,610
of opinions like I know we did fine so

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,420
the back road is like saying okay let's

00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:41,230
move on but doesn't do what he wants to

00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,230
represent the back

00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:35,369
okay interesting so you didn't say your

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,129
role but I think it would be developer

00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,259
who would that be fair to say okay this

00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:42,749
is just up off wine knowledge that I

00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,249
happened in there and but you raised a

00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,320
point you didn't say what you think

00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:48,419
technical writing is but you said you

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,239
mentioned a problem all technical

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:55,529
writing or one thing that you see is

00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:58,950
that when writing about it then if

00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:01,139
without the knowledge of the product

00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,090
actually using it right hands on

00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:07,080
experience experience gives you

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:10,409
something concrete to to express like if

00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,919
I were to say you know what's it I were

00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:17,669
to write a poem you know what's it like

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,519
to be blogging I had no experience in

00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:23,099
there so I couldn't really feel it but

00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:30,619
if I write another poem like what's it

00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:35,519
like to have nothing to say on stage

00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:38,999
okay great so experience that is a and

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:44,099
it could be a problem because nothing

00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:47,029
beats experience right okay good so are

00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:47,029
you raising your hand Oh

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:22,080
organization for you technical writing

00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:26,190
involves similar to what you are saying

00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,200
is more than just a foundation and it's

00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:39,930
specifically things that the customer

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:51,390
books or architecture moles things that

00:35:39,930 --> 00:36:01,140
are not strictly great so we probably

00:35:51,390 --> 00:36:04,920
are out of time right what's the next

00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:08,660
slide okay so next slide is we're going

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,370
to go into the actual no docs no commit

00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:14,990
philosophy okay so why don't we break

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:18,590
early and so that you get 15 minutes of

00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:21,390
time to decide to not on that you don't

00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:23,250
but also to get more food because I

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,740
think there's a lot of free food here

00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,460
please go out enjoy yourself we will

00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,860
reconvene at it while agent oh wait

00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:38,850
little puncture for flash speaks here

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:43,260
with the script and slide so you can

00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:49,920
find them all and for those more people

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:55,050
than go and apply space if you have hard

00:36:49,920 --> 00:37:04,050
copy and you wanted soft puppy that and

00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:07,950
the slides 1220 right yes please sit so

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:10,350
20 min time well thank you okay and you

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:15,200
see great to promote and also need to

00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:19,910
set feedback about the presentation

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,910
Michael's effects and exit your program

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,510
favorite

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,150
it's like

Oh

00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,420
first

00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:10,530
something like that

00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,290
yes

00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,370
you too

00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,680
I

00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,470
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,740
just a stone

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,480
ok

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:29,450
okay so we have time to kill let's

00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:40,310
finish this what is technical writing

00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:43,420
which is not this thing magically now

00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,420
we're going to go fast for it right

00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:59,040
by the way any anything about to play

00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,040
you can always talk to us afterwards ok

00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:06,730
ok so the next step before slightly

00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,280
before we get through this I want to

00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:12,190
open the same question what is technical

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,580
writing in my opinion or my experience

00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:39,130
to some of the onstage if you want to

00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:45,040
say something about that really

00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:48,370
understanding looks like he didn't we

00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:51,460
didn't try to understand it justly

00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:55,330
that's right all the time for another

00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:59,350
selling me he needs to have a little

00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:01,090
role outside too because sometimes we do

00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,080
you have questions right and we are

00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,080
trying to understand

00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,300
okay anyone else want to say something

00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:19,400
yeah I thought little people said about

00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:23,180
you know we should try talking about how

00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:25,880
we need to tell the customers tell them

00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,200
the things are interested and I think

00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,339
it's pretty pointed in a lot of ways

00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,690
we're kind of like an intermediary

00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:35,630
between software people develop it and

00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:44,270
the customers and so yeah we got to pay

00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:50,960
attention to get that information my

00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:56,410
name is cinemas right information have a

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,410
chance to talk to developers

01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:18,340
we have to somehow this I once used

01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:26,740
metaphors like a commercial that we are

01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:31,420
sort of like Moses because he has to

01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:44,609
take the infinitely complex world of the

01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:48,810
divine powers and yet to convince its

01:00:44,609 --> 01:01:18,310
and simplify it into something that is

01:00:48,810 --> 01:01:20,710
comprehensible yet about right all I can

01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:22,089
say is we're not professionals that is

01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:26,220
we're not professional actors so

01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:26,220
everything expressed here is in Syria

01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:29,550
all right

01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:46,250
that's very much so this leaves us

01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:50,740
actually these kinds of things like the

01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:53,900
friction or the difficulty in avoiding

01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:55,880
to lose our heads right I mean what is

01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,160
the act end of Act one what happened

01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,860
what was the consequence before the

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,550
rewind the minions lost their heads the

01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:08,600
Queen was irate their lives like a twerp

01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:12,050
it the king was dead yeah who cares

01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:15,110
about the king right it's the Queen

01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:19,280
accounts like okay yeah yeah the king

01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:24,530
was dead it was like a bad experience

01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:28,120
and so but the point is these things can

01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:31,820
were avoided in the second act due to a

01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:35,630
better communication model basically and

01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:38,270
so this is the focus of this talk

01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:43,640
actually what we're going to do now is

01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:47,750
pass on to step four to-do item number

01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:53,300
two is drop with a crock who knows who

01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:59,920
doesn't know what grok means okay can

01:02:53,300 --> 01:03:03,710
you explain what yes oh can you explain

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,040
our search bar from Robert science

01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,040
fiction

01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:31,610
stranger Hancock great okay oh no son

01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:33,380
very accurately yeah I had to squish it

01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:41,890
all on the slide and make it big and you

01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:41,890
know fulfilled right this is not good

01:03:46,060 --> 01:04:00,080
it's all caps just like so this is

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:08,740
completely violated the style guide but

01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:11,540
you know I had to do it right however

01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:14,900
this good point is that it's concise

01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:17,270
right and I think by the end of this

01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:22,820
talk then I hope that the people who are

01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:26,150
developers and who would like to help

01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:30,770
their documentation effort realize that

01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:33,740
a small concise note can be helpful as

01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:36,200
the seed right but we'll get to that in

01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:38,590
a few seconds so we're going to

01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:42,710
understand no Doc's note commit / merge

01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:45,950
but here we have no something no

01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:47,780
something okay this is a pattern what

01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:51,050
does it mean have you ever heard of this

01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:54,220
no food or drink no party no clue boss

01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:56,780
said no party that's got to be pretty

01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:58,960
common here right nobody has heard of

01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,960
that

01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:08,660
come on this is like or you know many

01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,910
commercials have this advertisements no

01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:14,720
no come party no party I mean this is

01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:17,780
just in Italy okay no work yeah exactly

01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:22,640
this is the same idea is what is saying

01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:25,760
the idea expresses is that without this

01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,350
important thing then you cannot have the

01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:33,920
next one right it's like a gauging

01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:37,760
factor so let's see next slide what is

01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:40,880
party here party is quality it's like

01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:43,160
without that kind of food and drink you

01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:48,620
can't have a quality experience right

01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:52,550
and so here the documentation including

01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:57,230
the user cases including the readme

01:05:52,550 --> 01:06:02,000
files including just the man pages all

01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:04,850
these things all are observed and read

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,980
and contribute to the quality of the

01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:10,250
user experience in this case the user is

01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:11,690
the customer and what we're trying to do

01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,970
is increase that overall experience

01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:16,090
right we're trying to get to quality

01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:19,670
we're trying to make quality to be a

01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:23,150
parent and because quality is not

01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:26,000
something that is can be really inherent

01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:28,970
in something like if I say is this does

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,370
this have quality this pad of paper or

01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:35,330
this pad of sticky notes does it have

01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:38,150
quality for some some people might say

01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:40,460
yes some people might say no and and the

01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:43,310
real answer is why would it have quality

01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:47,920
and who says for me it has quality

01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:47,920
because it's green I like this color and

01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:55,460
it calms me so this is it has quality

01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:57,710
but maybe and that's just right now

01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:01,040
because I'm nervous on some stage but

01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:03,440
maybe another day I don't need this is

01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:05,570
just it's dead trees and you know what a

01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,570
waste of resources we

01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:10,610
I could this has low quality so quality

01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:13,010
is in the perception and what we're

01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:16,880
talking about is the customer perception

01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:19,430
of not just the documentation not just

01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,750
things that they read but of the product

01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:26,120
right they they use the product I mean

01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:29,750
really we're talking about software what

01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:32,570
is it physically tangibly that the

01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:35,090
customer sees or peels what software

01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:39,230
there's a keyboard there's a screen

01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:41,960
there's you know the software is all

01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:46,100
inside everything is in their experience

01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:48,950
it and the documentation and how

01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:51,710
interact with software is all about the

01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:55,130
experience so quality comes from the

01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:58,820
experience quality is a the moment of

01:07:55,130 --> 01:08:00,920
experience according to this really old

01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:03,110
guy he's probably dead by now Robert and

01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:06,500
piercing anybody anybody here this

01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:08,090
author Robert and pure sake okay he

01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,390
wrote a book called zen and the art of

01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:13,130
motorcycle maintenance okay it's about

01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:16,400
quality it's an inquiry into the

01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:20,120
qualities okay so quality is the goal

01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:22,490
here but we can't build it into it so

01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:25,400
but how do we get to it we have to act

01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:29,600
in a way that fosters it okay so next

01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:33,800
slide so we have some QA people here QE

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:38,330
in some okay so what's the difference

01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:40,339
between QA and chewy who knows okay but

01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:42,380
the main thing is the Q right the Q is

01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:46,429
the quality

01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:50,500
sleep quality something but there's

01:08:46,429 --> 01:09:11,089
quality involved right so what do

01:08:50,500 --> 01:09:13,850
comment okay you should join the dots we

01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:16,100
make these fine distinctions okay in

01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:21,739
this community which is also concerned

01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:25,699
with quality then there is this

01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:30,790
philosophy okay no tests no commit what

01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:35,319
does this mean who can cue guys QA guys

01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:35,319
what is no tests no commitment tell me

01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:58,239
right okay so basically it's a gate on

01:09:55,179 --> 01:10:00,459
accepting of changes in the

01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:04,809
functionality and that gate is in the

01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:08,969
form of a test right no tests no proof

01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:12,130
of non regression or non breakage or

01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:17,409
copper integration than no commit right

01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:20,050
so basically saying we we can't really

01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:23,169
express qualities the one way that we

01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:25,449
know how to express quality is to say we

01:10:23,169 --> 01:10:28,630
don't want to break things okay or we

01:10:25,449 --> 01:10:31,510
want to make things and we will not step

01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:35,530
forward until we have the assurance and

01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:39,189
the engineering of a test test gives us

01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:42,669
this kind of thing so by doing this we

01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:44,769
don't know if really we can add quality

01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:48,099
but we know that we're maintaining it

01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:51,039
right by doing this process okay so same

01:10:48,099 --> 01:10:53,229
idea let's go what's the what's the

01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:56,079
difference one it's more than one letter

01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:59,590
this time right it's one word no docs no

01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:02,380
commit this is because now we're

01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:05,429
thinking okay before I commit before I

01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:09,479
make this change I as a programmer or

01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:11,800
developer in the common parlance I am

01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,479
thinking not only of the functionality

01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,320
not only that I don't want to break

01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:19,959
things but i'm thinking of the user or

01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,880
the customer the client it's like i'm

01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:24,610
changing for example i changed the

01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:28,689
output format on the bin list command

01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:31,809
right i remember a long time ago vin

01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:37,630
lists used to have a fixed width format

01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:41,890
that is when you say list LS minus L you

01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:45,900
get the fixed number of columns for each

01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:49,840
each field for example and this was

01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:53,200
really problematic for for user names

01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,990
because my user name was or login name I

01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,990
guess ttn which is short so there's like

01:11:55,990 --> 01:12:02,050
lots of space that's wasted right if you

01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:07,140
look at the bin list output you see but

01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:12,580
these days if you do a bin list minus L

01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:14,950
then if all the columns are of one width

01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:17,560
then they're compressed right so this is

01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:21,190
a change in the output format of the LS

01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:24,160
command so whoever did that it was a

01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:30,850
good new hacker because this is knew you

01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:33,730
Cory tools at that point they documented

01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:35,740
it ok so they were doing this they were

01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:37,450
saying ok I'm going to make a change in

01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:40,300
the output format this is something that

01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:45,820
will affect the user I'm going to

01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:50,740
document it because i want the

01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:55,240
documentation how the user perceives my

01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:57,430
program would you know to be in sync to

01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,650
be synchronized without the reality how

01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:01,630
it actually behaves right so in this way

01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:08,050
that I maintain the quality of the

01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:11,410
program so that's the idea of having a

01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:14,920
synchronized thing and the communication

01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:16,690
style helps a lot with that ok so this

01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,450
is what is one guy it's very easy

01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:24,160
because it just takes a the the right

01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:28,090
mentality to think ok well I have some

01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:30,070
pride in the output I have the pride in

01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:32,740
the user experience I want them to be

01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:34,240
synchronized it's all one guy but when

01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:37,480
there's more than one person when

01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:40,980
there's a docs team and there's like the

01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:44,890
developing team and there's QE team and

01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:45,160
how can they maintain quality if they

01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:47,470
don't

01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:50,430
communicate right that's basically what

01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:56,890
we're saying here so next slide please

01:13:50,430 --> 01:14:00,310
so that's the gist of this this

01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:02,710
presentation is like how applicable is

01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:06,910
this philosophy though right and why is

01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:11,140
there no docs no commit / merge I mean

01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:15,370
what's up like besides violating style

01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:20,250
guides why is there why is there this if

01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:24,760
i take like when you're committing to

01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:30,790
your changing the software every single

01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:33,700
change if you submit a small blurb to

01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:36,640
the docs team and say okay you know i

01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:39,040
change this change that then maybe

01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:43,030
that's too granular in fact i would say

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:46,390
most people kind of think that's that's

01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:48,610
the first reaction we get okay you want

01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:51,070
you want me to inform you I'm of the

01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:52,630
programmer or developer you want me to

01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:55,360
inform you of everything that I do

01:14:52,630 --> 01:15:00,190
that's like well I just you know changed

01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:02,530
a little a typo here or I just changed

01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:04,420
the white space or added comments like I

01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:07,740
don't need to inform you that and i

01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:09,820
agree i think that's too granular right

01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:12,250
because that's not something that would

01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:14,320
affect the user the user or the client

01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:19,330
or the customer doesn't see these things

01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:22,030
so if i take a strict stance like okay

01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:23,680
well i'm going to improve my

01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:25,360
organization and we're going to make all

01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,250
the programmers every commit they're

01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,310
going to do something with Doc's related

01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:33,490
that's too granular okay next step next

01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:37,570
slide if you do no docs no merge which

01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:38,820
means okay on every merge so I do a

01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:41,160
bunch of commits to

01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:43,200
and you know do my rebasing little luck

01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:46,770
and now it's time to merge the feature

01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:49,710
into the main line if I do that then

01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:52,500
maybe it's two courts right there's a

01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:57,630
lot of documentation that could be

01:15:52,500 --> 01:16:00,020
affected by that one so obviously if one

01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:04,140
is too granular and the others to course

01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:06,660
you have to do the next one right you

01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:10,440
have to do you have to choose you have

01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:13,170
to choose at runtime next slide which

01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:16,710
would be criminal it depends right

01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:21,150
that's why it depends you have to think

01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:23,430
about what is the impact the client

01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:28,380
impact the customer impact the end user

01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:38,010
in bed so at this point people are going

01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:45,120
to escape by they sent it back so it is

01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:48,630
i think it is not the intent of this

01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,670
talk to say no docs know commit it's not

01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:55,140
the intent of this presentation to say

01:16:50,670 --> 01:17:00,540
no docs no merge but is to encourage the

01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:02,629
thinking of what when i do a change does

01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:06,889
it

01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:10,349
music the end user the client the

01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:11,669
customer or even myself because

01:17:10,349 --> 01:17:14,129
oftentimes I'm going to be writing

01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:16,889
software for myself that I'm going to be

01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:18,269
using in six months and I had a cool new

01:17:16,889 --> 01:17:20,219
option then I start to use it

01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:22,679
immediately but I forget about that

01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:25,439
option and that in six months I'm like

01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:27,719
cursing up a storm because i think i hit

01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:29,429
the same use case i want to add that

01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:32,129
option again i have to go look at the

01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:34,379
source wow I could have saved myself you

01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:35,809
know three hours of digging around if I

01:17:34,379 --> 01:17:39,239
just written a little bit of

01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:42,059
documentation in a readme file you know

01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:45,780
that explains this new option but the

01:17:42,059 --> 01:17:49,769
point here is that commits to court to

01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:52,619
granular merging perhaps to course it

01:17:49,769 --> 01:17:56,219
should be together and when you have a

01:17:52,619 --> 01:18:02,489
team separate teams then this

01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:05,760
togetherness has to be should be this is

01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:08,070
what we hold here it should be part of

01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:12,749
the system of the organization that is

01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:15,209
there should be some kind of let's work

01:18:12,749 --> 01:18:18,889
together to add this feature let's work

01:18:15,209 --> 01:18:22,949
together in form so there's a planning

01:18:18,889 --> 01:18:26,729
at the planning stage then things to get

01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:30,199
started excuse me once I don't can

01:18:26,729 --> 01:18:30,199
someone else for a bit

01:18:48,310 --> 01:19:00,639
so this is revision control to the

01:18:55,250 --> 01:19:11,800
changes eventually she can look into the

01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:11,800
law and change without the developer

01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:22,639
would be acting in the idea but in our

01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:26,350
board when we usually work on several

01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:29,150
tracks and there are many like

01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:33,020
documentation must be documented for

01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:36,590
example there's there's no time to

01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:40,770
search cherish mystery for every every

01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:44,800
product basically

01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:49,290
alright so looking into the revision

01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,290
story it is thanks

01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,840
which is

01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:50,820
mrs. Ford as well aware that we want to

01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,820
know why

01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:08,070
the last we had and basically my peoples

01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:10,110
because i was just looking upstream your

01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:15,330
business and our students most colleges

01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:19,410
dimension to it works and I kind of

01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:21,450
complex right and so so I was I was host

01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:24,810
I was almost really was an unbiased

01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:26,940
admit I was frustrated I did I I wanted

01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:32,840
to do men took the best but sometimes

01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:32,840
you need to try to then I just wanted

01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,880
anything the tedious ain't got

01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:43,740
coarseness regularity of most myths are

01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:47,250
incredibly granular you no one can if I

01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:49,500
say oh you know this now works with 64

01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:51,420
my files or something and that might

01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:53,280
actually mean to the customer you can

01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,510
use it on 10 different kinds of

01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,190
architectures you can use it on before

01:21:54,510 --> 01:22:00,200
but for the developer they just you know

01:21:56,190 --> 01:22:00,200
it's a different thing that's all

01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:25,969
and if I'm fix it but it brings

01:22:30,929 --> 01:22:37,350
two leg commit blood like this is

01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:43,080
something that you use experiences I

01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:43,080
mean we could probably arrange something

01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:10,530
really good approach to the system is to

01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:17,280
know your developers right you need to

01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:21,870
know the guy you know basically I feel

01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:33,270
that maybe sometimes the recommendation

01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:35,700
would be to be somehow integrated good

01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:38,160
thing to do is to integrate all those

01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:40,320
people together because overall we are

01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,920
working for the same thing right he

01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:47,060
wants to be this productive circle and

01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:47,060
you know it will should know

01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,830
it's a little tree are just two separate

01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:29,590
team usually every one of us working on

01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:46,840
some oh no panting and you get move to

01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:54,970
other people so I and I know and so that

01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:57,610
we don't forget it's more it it so maybe

01:24:54,970 --> 01:25:00,540
that connectedness is it was like that

01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:04,180
because sometimes it's hard to do that

01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:06,970
working on a big project for example i

01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:13,450
went into me diplo magnetic resonance

01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:17,440
which is a beast with several topics and

01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:20,790
i couldn't have the expertise to know

01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,790
everything from networking

01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:11,140
yes right I every time the beginning is

01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:13,810
always the worst part you because pro

01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:16,330
tempore I mean I just want to learn as

01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:19,030
much as I can about a thing so I can

01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:23,380
start yeah and as for your question to

01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:41,800
decide what we do you see our guidelines

01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:44,680
you have a style guide yeah I want to

01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:49,180
expand on that question and also the

01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:53,820
answer I think ideally then we would

01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:57,340
have standards and we would also help

01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:58,990
developers to approach those standards I

01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:00,910
don't think we can expect everybody to

01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:03,100
maintain the standards that's why we're

01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:06,130
the professionals and other people do

01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:09,100
things that they're good at but we can

01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:12,430
say for example if we expect things in

01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:14,260
outline format we can say you know how

01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:17,710
to structure the information so that

01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:22,420
it's the initial handoff is more

01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:24,670
efficient and just less of a having to

01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:27,310
dig out the information from one side

01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:29,699
and to the other both happening it's

01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:37,019
like an agreed specification for

01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:38,639
how to communicate right it's like we

01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:41,550
didn't need to say it oh they're all

01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:45,630
procedures need to know right now it's

01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:48,630
like that it is more information we can

01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:52,110
start it right how so if you test stuff

01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:53,820
so then maybe think about something else

01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:58,469
you could put can we add to the
