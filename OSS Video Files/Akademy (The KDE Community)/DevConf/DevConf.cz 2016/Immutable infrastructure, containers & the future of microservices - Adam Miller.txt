Title: Immutable infrastructure, containers & the future of microservices - Adam Miller
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Many current trends in software development and deployment are based around the concept of microservices, small independent services interconnected via application programming interfaces (APIs).

The concept of immutable infrastructure is another area of application life cycle that’s gaining attention. In immutable infrastructure, we deploy immutable components that are replaced each time we deploy instead of in-place upgrades.

In this session, we’ll discuss the use of containers as a delivery mechanism for microservices following the immutable infrastructure paradigm. We’ll show this in the context of Project Atomic and OpenShift.
