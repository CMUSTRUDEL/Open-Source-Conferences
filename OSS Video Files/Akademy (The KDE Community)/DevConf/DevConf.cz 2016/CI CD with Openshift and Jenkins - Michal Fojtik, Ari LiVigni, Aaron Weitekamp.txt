Title: CI CD with Openshift and Jenkins - Michal Fojtik, Ari LiVigni, Aaron Weitekamp
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Openshift has the mechanism for building and deploying applications and Jenkins is a tool use for continuous integration/delivery/deployment. If we combine these together we can create a CI/CD pipeline that will allow us to promote builds of applications and make them available in our OSE instance. This could also be extended to publish to an external Docker registry as well.
