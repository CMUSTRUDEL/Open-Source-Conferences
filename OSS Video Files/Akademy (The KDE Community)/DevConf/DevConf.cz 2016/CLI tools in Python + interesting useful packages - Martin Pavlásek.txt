Title: CLI tools in Python + interesting useful packages - Martin PavlÃ¡sek
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	You can take advantages of Python even you don't know the language!

One part of this session would be focused on useful python modules, that can be used as command line tools in your scripts - knowledge of python is not required.

By the rest of time I would like to show you subset of interesting python packages available on PyPi and how these tools can you help to avoid reinventing wheel. Ready for action? :-)

You can looking forward to a lot of demos.

thank you for in forma welcome my name

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,689
is marking for a sec and today I would

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,799
like to show you pretty cool stuff what

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:18,270
you can do in terminal with hot button

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:23,369
if you maybe don't know let's jump into

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,790
the real life task image in some video

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,390
on youtube and you decide to download it

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:36,210
so you have certain ways how we could do

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:39,780
that there exists some web services that

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:44,189
can do this for you or you can install

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,420
an ad on your browser but it's still not

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:53,880
so good why how you can do that another

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,780
task imaging some JSON why this and you

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,180
want to read the structure

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,330
and yeah it's completely fine from for

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:06,770
scripts machines and this stuff but it's

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:10,340
not so comfortable for real humans so

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:15,230
how can whiten can help us in such

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,550
situations there exists a package which

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:26,660
is called x cube that you can use in

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:30,680
your scripts or if i would go back to

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,980
the jason example there exists a module

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,140
which is called Jason dude tool which

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:43,090
actually works as a student filter and

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:47,950
whatever put in if 48 formats and

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,950
predict pretty nicely

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:59,580
so what you are going to do today this

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,980
session is considered as a workshop so

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm going to show you a lot of demos

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:11,100
that I've prepared for you but also you

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,910
can try all these stuff on your own I

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:19,530
will show you that it's in the next

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:23,640
slide in order to use these tools I mean

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:27,690
install em I will do short introduction

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:32,100
about faith bye bye and what's virtual

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:34,710
and if you maybe didn't know I have a

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,980
question for you please raise your hands

00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:44,250
who knows Python I mean knows how to

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:47,640
write l word but today I expected thank

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,070
you but for others I have good news you

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,870
don't have to know the language to be

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:57,390
able to use these tools so no worries

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:01,830
that's why this session wouldn't be

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:05,330
about the Python as a language so I own

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:10,800
go I'm not going to do anything about

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:16,500
decorators generators and other vital

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,330
specific stuff so you can try it on your

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,330
own if you visit

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:36,819
is that application you will find that

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:42,289
all materials for this session when you

00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:46,970
finish the cloning there's script which

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:51,650
creates virtual and for you and you can

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:54,740
invoke it by this comment in case you

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:58,610
will have some problems with that there

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:03,080
are several or at least a few I used

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:07,039
with stickers that you can use some

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,340
problems with this ticket with those

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,340
files

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,840
a python installation it has to be

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,330
downloaded or installed into the system

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:16,190
package manager if you are using Fedora

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:22,360
CentOS or RL just type dnf install

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:29,390
python virtual end to enter the virtual

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:36,500
just source file which is in bin folder

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:42,110
and activate so it seems that you are

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:47,840
ready to play something so welcome to my

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:51,290
sandbox I have prepared demos of on

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:56,620
several categories the first of them

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,620
would be about manipulation with files

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:07,409
you probably know zip archives right but

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,629
you maybe didn't know that the resist

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:16,789
fighting module which you can use for

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:24,659
creating archives listing files in there

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:29,629
and as and also which because it's just

00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:33,779
write a library you can use the same

00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:37,460
functions in your script so let's just

00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,460
shortly take a look on it

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,110
I have some examples here

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,130
so

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:07,600
some modules can be invoked by Python

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:12,010
dash M which will let's say execute the

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:19,710
module itself as as it works in this

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:25,590
example so decia Python dash MZ file and

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:34,500
i dunno i don't remember all parameters

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:34,500
so what's listed it so what's in there

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:49,680
yeah but we can also do that the same by

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:54,850
Python so what's open I bite on which is

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,330
interactive more interactive version of

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,330
item

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:14,000
import the module open are an archive

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:17,780
and see what's in there you can also get

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,080
some more information about just one of

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:30,040
the files that would be pi tended PNG

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,040
for example get size after compression

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,640
or before

00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:54,899
another one which is module which is

00:09:50,850 --> 00:10:00,199
called file cmp which stands for final

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:03,680
compares it actually works as well for

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,680
comparing directories

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,010
so let's try that

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:41,230
and you can see that there is one file

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:47,750
which is called doggle mg which is

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:56,180
contained in to both directories okay we

00:10:47,750 --> 00:11:03,440
can do the same in the Python itself so

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:06,650
what's important what you do today and

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,560
once there take a look what's just in to

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,560
be directory this is a content

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:25,070
and this is common dick report we just

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,070
saw it in previous from the command line

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:38,140
look for some tests and image filters or

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:41,260
tools as I show you on there just

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:45,280
beginning there exists a tool with our

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:51,010
package which is built in which is Jason

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:53,350
do to do you can use it as a filter I

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,850
mean it works for standard bit wound and

00:11:53,350 --> 00:12:04,960
started output but also you can pass

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:12,850
files that should work I have another

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:16,120
question all of you knows worse or there

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:19,720
exists something algorithm which is

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,830
fault rot13 do you have any idea where

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:28,480
this can be used or or some application

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:36,790
or some place but you where you notice

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:42,070
this for example there exists one kind

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:47,710
of outdoor game about finding stuff

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:54,190
outside ok it's geocaching because when

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:58,630
you visit some page of the cash there is

00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:02,380
a clue that should help you to find the

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:09,880
actual location of the box and this crew

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:13,380
is encoded into this is already what's

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,380
nice it's symmetric

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,100
so

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:55,090
so hi all should we translate it into UV

00:13:46,630 --> 00:14:02,520
and why I but you can use it twice and

00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:05,890
you will get the same input mark down

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:11,790
you probably notice that all of github

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:15,520
repos are using greet Brittany files

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:20,530
which looks pretty nice what actually do

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:25,330
others octo repo actually don't try HTML

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:30,250
into that files in the most cases it's

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:34,000
written in markdown language and Python

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:39,030
provides a package which converts this

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,030
markdown syntax into HTML

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:14,890
so the input for example can looks like

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:20,950
this jar headlines place and we can turn

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:23,100
it into the HTML which will looks like

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,100
this

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,410
so this is the output

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:46,830
but also there are exists a package

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:51,280
which you can use for inversion

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:54,010
conversation that would that tries to

00:15:51,280 --> 00:16:02,410
parse HTML file and put it into the

00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:08,850
markdown back the name is Margot

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,850
anything some leftovers

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:28,560
and actually despite this package

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:35,340
doesn't provide come online API so it's

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:39,630
necessary to use the patent in this

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:45,600
example I just open the output which is

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:52,290
example dat HTML reach all lines and by

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:58,400
mark gongloff a4 just turn it into the

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,400
markdown back so this is an input

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:10,480
and this is the output in the Marvel it

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:14,350
doesn't look exactly the same but it's

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:20,199
pretty similar what's nice actually we

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:29,170
can test it it I mean you can use Python

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:41,230
again and use markdown comments which

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:44,130
should turn this back into HTML so let's

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,130
see the differences

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:59,210
it doesn't look exactly the same but I

00:17:55,879 --> 00:18:06,820
think it's still pretty useful there is

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:06,820
only differences in rendering lists

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:22,200
one iron this is my favorite you

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:26,750
probably know command which is called NL

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:31,920
number lines but move but it's not so

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:35,610
flexible as you sometimes you need one

00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:40,220
hand one liner module allows you to put

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:46,550
any expression that you and wants to

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,550
apply to the each line of the input

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:11,120
so this is order example of order an

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:17,950
output of an L and let's try to mimic

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:22,730
the same output there is an hour

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:26,600
variable its stands for the number of

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:33,230
the line and underscore which which is

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:39,110
actually the line of the input let's say

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:43,400
click on other example because it's yeah

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:48,230
also sometimes you need or you want to

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:55,130
print the file name of the input that's

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:57,910
why there exist FN variable which could

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,910
taste this name

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:10,580
and because it's Ordinary by that

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:13,760
expression you can for example use the

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:20,390
upper method and brings everything in

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:25,420
uppercase but we can still may go for

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:29,380
the former the one-liner module also

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:33,610
contains ability or have ability to

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:39,200
import other modules and this example I

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:47,770
will use verbal expression substitution

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:53,230
so I will import the module and turns

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,230
every number into the number as a word

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:09,150
so now you can see that port number and

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:09,150
all constants are substituted

00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:25,590
pigments you probably one sometimes

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:30,620
polarize some source for this utility is

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,620
pretty handy for such situations

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:55,470
it's pretty clever tool because it will

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,470
adjust the output to the formatting oh

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,690
what can one run will wrong

00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,530
a stupid

00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:21,909
so if I specify output as PNG

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,430
get to go

00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:35,089
create the picture

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,890
there's you can also yeah

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,660
the output can be also order HTML page

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:19,360
or you can use different color theme and

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:21,570
also add numbering of lines which looks

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,570
like this

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but there is also an option that you can

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:38,240
unfortunately I can't show you this

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:44,330
example but there is one feature that

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:52,080
will display non-visible characters vice

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:56,640
dots and other characters so that was

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,990
five months I'm relief is British Utley

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,950
if you have to pretty similar pictures

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:08,220
but it's not so obvious what's why they

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,370
are different or if the if is there any

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,370
difference

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,540
so if I show you the first

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,470
and the second the problem didn't notice

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,470
anything

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:55,009
but if I I'm video it's displaced pretty

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:59,980
nicely where our differences also you

00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:04,749
can specify background color so it can

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,749
look a little bit better

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:16,590
also you can use file as output

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:28,830
and have it as a Audrina folder file

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:38,740
let's say go for something interesting

00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:41,950
for the pythoness language you probably

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:46,870
know pdb biting debugger which is

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:48,640
integrated in its which is built in but

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,580
you maybe didn't know that there exists

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:57,510
a pretty nice comment line or text based

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:57,510
de baccarat which is called by you DB

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:14,220
I have some example here this is just

00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:17,880
pretty easy example and on this line I

00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,880
put a breakpoint

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:37,990
you can use cursor cursor arrows or vin

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:44,110
movements to look around if you press n

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:49,280
it will do one step or one yeah it will

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:54,049
jump into the next line if I want if I'd

00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:59,210
like to go inside press s like a step

00:26:54,049 --> 00:27:05,169
and you can go forward further on the

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:11,120
right side there is variable list and

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:19,910
what's pretty nice you can also see the

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:24,080
structure of each variable ok so go next

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:28,940
ah something's wrong because exception

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:33,760
in was traced so let's hit that e it

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:38,260
seems that I passed something wrong into

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,260
this method

00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:47,220
I don't want to continue because I need

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:51,360
to edit the code so i will press Q as a

00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:57,649
quid which immediately exits the

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,649
debugger so let's fix it

00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:10,780
also there is nice feature which is

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,400
pretty common and dip in debuggers but

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:19,600
this one also is able to do the same

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:23,860
which is run into the cursor so move

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:27,190
your cursor whenever you want press T

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:38,220
and the execution would be stopped at

00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:42,550
this place also our wonder method

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,000
returns something you will see it on the

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,000
right side

00:28:52,870 --> 00:29:01,190
this exception is generated on a CD out

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:04,400
just about the Piton the bugger if I

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:09,200
remove the bad point it wouldn't be

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:14,590
there so that was another debugger that

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:21,350
you can be that you can use notebook is

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:23,620
pretty written nice to actually this web

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,620
server

00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:47,539
it provides other features one of that I

00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:47,539
like the most is terminal

00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:14,030
so I'm in the browser but I still do

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:18,440
everything as in order terminal let's

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:25,310
what one thing andrew is the PI to

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:28,880
notebook this is that I'm environment

00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:38,180
lets you interactively execute some

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:44,230
parts of your code and also you can run

00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,230
off deals dismiss these cells at once

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:59,669
so if you hit shift enter it will

00:30:49,200 --> 00:31:04,940
execute do this this place and it's you

00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:08,370
can see that 30 works for the each

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,510
execution you can also put several lines

00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:22,710
in the code into the cell and run it

00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:29,000
once but you can also it also contains

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:29,000
auto competition just breaking it

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:55,059
it also have you can also edit any other

00:31:47,980 --> 00:32:01,440
folder any other file it is support for

00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:01,440
a lot of other languages

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,679
and such case

00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:30,710
so it it was spite a notebook and what

00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:37,100
if you need great sound data for example

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:40,490
for testing purposes in case of CSV you

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:45,879
can use a random data module which

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:50,649
provides data gin functionality

00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:54,350
according to spec file it will generate

00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:56,619
defined amount of lines of just this

00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,619
file

00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,780
yes

00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:28,330
the spec file can looks like this you

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:34,480
can for the interior of comms you can

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:43,210
use ranges minimum or maximum you can

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:47,379
also specify a date also to Delta

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:50,529
between generated items and it's also

00:33:47,379 --> 00:34:00,330
possible to pass your own format extreme

00:33:50,529 --> 00:34:03,460
here or for some other cases you can use

00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:06,249
one of these choices which should be

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:08,919
randomly picked up what is it pretty

00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:15,790
nice you can also pass a regular

00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:20,379
expression and this tool will use it for

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:23,250
creating some random names so let's take

00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:23,250
a look at it look at it

00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:37,730
this parameter dash L stands for I want

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,730
to create just 10 lines

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:49,590
it creates new file and this is an

00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:54,899
output you can see that for example

00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:57,510
these soldier names are generated

00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:02,810
according to reg apps because not all

00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,810
not all of them are has the same land

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:10,070
like it dries several times and also the

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,070
output change

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:22,400
or you can fight others I mean create

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:26,750
some random names but this is much more

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,330
clever tool because fight factory also

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:33,910
considers your national environment

00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:33,910
which can be sometimes pretty handy

00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:53,080
first of all I will show you the title

00:35:49,220 --> 00:36:00,650
direction using his pretty obvious

00:35:53,080 --> 00:36:05,630
whenever you invoke name it will pass

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:14,030
it'll you will get the new name or the

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:18,080
new string at this computer I have US

00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:24,460
national us environment so also the

00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:24,460
names and the rest looks like that

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:42,230
about what if I want to generate three

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:46,460
check addresses you can just pass doing

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:49,329
or nationality specification and it

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,329
works pretty nice

00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,880
and what if I'd like to generate then

00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,880
check names

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,770
did you find dress yourself there

00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:24,760
because yesterday I it generates a name

00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:29,980
of 11 friend I mean his name and surname

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:33,520
as well but was pretty nice you can also

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:38,950
try to for example use Bulgarian

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:43,470
national environment I mean I'm not

00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,470
completely able to read this no way

00:37:50,619 --> 00:38:03,759
you can see which nationalities you can

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:08,019
use so it's really nice at this point I

00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:12,069
would like to do a short break you can

00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:16,079
take a coffee or just poke around and we

00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:16,079
can be exact let's say

00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:22,910
stupid

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,910
you know

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,750
mother son

00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,180
everybody

00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:15,010
there are also some sizzurp our wiki

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,010
Scott

00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,610
should

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,760
you

00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:21,410
to financial

00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,700
the

00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,660
you

00:48:56,549 --> 00:49:09,900
I don't know I don't know how that stuff

00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:15,469
it works yes yeah it was what about yeah

00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:20,969
you wanted to sit here it's 14 yes I'm

00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:23,429
over a half of the presentation so yeah

00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:31,069
and I also think that all of people is

00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:33,989
not is not back and now yeah I don't

00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:36,349
discriminate in the whole check our way

00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:36,349
we can

00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,640
ok

00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:30,829
fashion to encourage you to ask

00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,510
questions to speaker looking at some

00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:34,510
cool river from Red Hat

00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,580
thanks for coming back and let's

00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:53,400
continue on the under part you should be

00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:57,340
about presentation you can use

00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:00,670
OpenOffice impress or another tool but

00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:04,620
also there exists a package which will

00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:08,890
relative great presentation as

00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:12,130
interactive HTML page design is biting

00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:15,520
pie down beaver there also exists

00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:19,330
package which is just called by down but

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:25,060
it's do different stuff so don't do the

00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:27,780
mistake assigned it string so let's take

00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,780
a look how it works

00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,480
usage is pretty obvious

00:52:53,010 --> 00:53:00,930
this is example how the slice can looks

00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:06,560
like it's order in markdown syntax but

00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:14,610
there is ! slide which is divider about

00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:23,010
content of each slides so we can run it

00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:29,150
and it will generate HTML folder with

00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:29,150
index HTML inside in inside it's in it

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:46,880
and this is the output you can use your

00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:52,010
arrow keys able to navigate between the

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:54,980
sides it also supports pretty nice

00:53:52,010 --> 00:54:00,320
called highlighting in different

00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:02,570
languages it I think it also used bike

00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:11,380
months that I showed you in some

00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:18,860
previous example it also contains some

00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:22,510
pretty nice animations if you want yeah

00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,510
and that's it

00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:35,580
another way how you can do the

00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:41,670
presentation from markdown is called ODP

00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:45,300
down which turns your markdown file into

00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:47,430
open up open the current format actually

00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:50,040
I use this tool for creating this

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:52,620
presentation this because it's much more

00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:57,270
easier at least for me to maintain the

00:54:52,620 --> 00:55:04,170
content in github or I'm get in plain

00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:06,500
text form instead of ODP binary so how

00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,500
it works

00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:36,280
let's have some slides such like this

00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:40,060
it's for this tool there is no slight

00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:45,510
divider as you as I show you in this in

00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:51,390
previous example but it's split slides

00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:57,190
according to headlines so this is a

00:55:51,390 --> 00:56:06,070
sites chapter and with in the second

00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:10,170
level headline could be content I also

00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:10,170
have some template for this purpose

00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:25,870
let's have some first slide second and

00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:31,180
something for the end but I would like

00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:40,210
to insert my mark down slides somewhere

00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:45,370
in between so how it can be done ODP

00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:50,080
down understands several parameters the

00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:53,100
most important our content master the

00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:57,220
template contains several master pages

00:56:53,100 --> 00:57:03,180
which would be used for first headlines

00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:07,480
and just second level headlines so the

00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:10,570
main one I call it chapter because its

00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:14,980
name in the template into inside the

00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:24,160
template and the content actually I can

00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:27,220
show you it again view mr. slides this

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:32,610
will be the content chapter content last

00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:32,610
slides and this would be chapter

00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:42,030
but I don't want to insert everything to

00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:46,930
the end of the template I want to put it

00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:49,960
and this in the third position people

00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:55,680
all presentation so that's why i'm

00:57:49,960 --> 00:58:02,160
passing HP and the number were these

00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:02,160
marked down slides would be inserted

00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,940
so let's run it

00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:21,959
and let's take a look out this will it

00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:25,319
look likes so we have first light from

00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:29,279
the template second slide from the

00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:35,849
template and this is a content from the

00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:38,400
markdown file this one as well and the

00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:43,789
last one is also contained in the

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:48,390
template so you can combine some

00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:52,940
handcrafted slides with the others which

00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:52,940
you can maintain in the markdown file

00:58:56,449 --> 00:59:04,920
another pretty I all of this tool it's

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:11,029
called play it again Sam there are

00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:15,329
several other variations of this tool I

00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:18,479
think one of them is do it live right by

00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:23,160
but this one I found a little bit more

00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:26,670
handy actually it does a recording of

00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:32,029
your terminal session and you can recall

00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:32,029
it everywhere you want again

00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:49,530
the command that the package will

00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:49,530
install into your system is PS

00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:56,500
and for example record something

01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:07,689
it is that it does nothing but actually

01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:10,329
it's not true it drops me into the sub

01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:13,449
shell and from this point every

01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:23,609
keystroke is recorded and the output as

01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:23,609
well so i can bring the date or

01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:39,640
something with a lot of typos oh no just

01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,640
hide

01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:57,650
to stop the recording just leave the

01:00:48,630 --> 01:01:01,340
terminal I mean just type exit and let's

01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,340
let's fly it again

01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:17,340
and now the funny thing will happen I

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:20,550
can press any key on my keyboard for

01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:23,760
example just space bar all the time but

01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:31,770
actually it will shows you just the

01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:40,490
recorded characters so I hit enter I'd

01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:46,220
actually this I screwed it up oh and

01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:49,290
continue typing you can see it also

01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:56,070
record my tacos I mean backspace

01:01:49,290 --> 01:02:01,320
backspace this but I'm still working on

01:01:56,070 --> 01:02:05,810
the same bottom in my keyboard all the

01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,810
time and just wait for the enter

01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:16,849
there is also pretty nice feature which

01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:22,349
is called auto type and out of a pound

01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:26,540
auto type is actually time out between

01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:34,130
each keystroke and out of a point is

01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:34,130
time out or just played for hit enter

01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:46,950
sure it depends on what you want because

01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:55,109
there exists also life something

01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:59,430
parameter which is not you can you know

01:02:55,109 --> 01:03:03,150
about it from the hub but yeah I can

01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:07,260
show the example award it also captures

01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:09,900
the output box with the perimeter it

01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:15,770
will execute the command by the time you

01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:15,770
are replying the session

01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:27,730
so if I decide to just use 15

01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:31,470
milliseconds per each stroke and 700 for

01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:31,470
each enter enter

01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:59,180
looks like a video yeah actually a good

01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:02,150
me yeah i'm using this tool in several

01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:05,530
examples but not all the time just in

01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:08,600
the some little bit difficult because

01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:13,100
it's so easy to do a lot of typos here

01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:19,960
so i want to do you to enjoy this

01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:25,210
session and not enjoy my typos button

01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:25,210
back to your question for example

01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:56,560
what's seeded day here and do the same

01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:56,560
so yes recorded session date

01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:09,369
exit

01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:09,369
if I would record it play

01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,849
to date is in past

01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:30,300
actually I don't remember the name of

01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:32,780
the parameter but i know that there

01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,780
exists

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,820
our life we play

01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,370
so late

01:05:55,490 --> 01:06:03,860
as you can see to date the output is the

01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:08,960
same so can so yes you can use recorded

01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:12,410
output and you can also use it for the

01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:15,369
live output which is not which it

01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,369
depends on your own

01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:27,580
here I almost forgotten they also exist

01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:30,090
HTML player for this it's done by the

01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,090
same author

01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:53,799
this is example from the from the altar

01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,799
it's not done buying them done by me I

01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:01,989
still Firefox and words works the same

01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,440
let's move to some interesting system

01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:19,090
with turkeys all of you are using a

01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:21,910
keyboard but though it's not pretty so

01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:29,800
much handy tools for manipulating with

01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:33,880
the content I really like moyer which is

01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:40,270
hot copy and paste just also just just

01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:42,750
beep install copy paste and use it I'm

01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:51,820
for example are going to copy this

01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:57,810
section based just put it in it in the

01:07:51,820 --> 01:08:05,190
output and I can also use standard input

01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:05,190
as the content of the clipboard

01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:18,470
so

01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:20,540
sometimes pretty handy by inotify it can

01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:24,560
be useful when you design some

01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:28,730
application which for example to watch

01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:33,230
some directory if there are as if there

01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:36,410
are some changes for example the user

01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:38,980
change config file or some new file will

01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,980
appear that

01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:10,060
so I can what if i create a new file the

01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:13,839
event would be raised and in your Python

01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:18,180
scripts you can create a handler that

01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:18,180
will do something on this event

01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:34,089
something for internet simple HTTP

01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:36,040
server is pretty simple too in case you

01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:40,210
have some folder and you want to share

01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:42,569
it for example on your local network to

01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,569
a friend

01:09:51,930 --> 01:10:05,300
use pretty obvious just call this call

01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:08,300
the module by default it works on port

01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,300
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:21,240
and this is a content if I for example

01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:37,010
creating a folder just refreshed the

01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:37,010
page and the content will appear

01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:44,500
donut lee true

01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:55,760
it depends on your firewall

01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:57,830
configuration by default I I think it

01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:01,730
wouldn't be possible at least on this

01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:04,490
machine but yeah if the if the port if

01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:10,600
the port would be open it's sure to

01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:14,960
anybody on the same network down at it

01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:20,980
this is a contest for you do any of you

01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:25,280
have any idea where or for which purpose

01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:30,010
you can use talent by these days you

01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:30,010
know that it's pretty old part of me

01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:54,470
great there's also just all so let's say

01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:58,870
it's a toy which is more work for fun

01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:58,870
than for real work

01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:17,130
say thought it was one time ago yeah

01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:20,450
exactly yeah its ASCII art version of of

01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:20,450
this movie yeah

01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:50,390
I'm not going to play the whole movie

01:12:47,300 --> 01:13:13,490
here it takes more than half an hour at

01:12:50,390 --> 01:13:16,640
least but yeah it works there is you a

01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:19,540
visit on the cinema y plus i don't know

01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,540
month or two

01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:33,810
another thing that I already mentioned

01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:36,590
in just her beginning is by Q which is

01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:52,620
utility that you can use for downloading

01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:54,860
videos from the internet some action as

01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:58,430
possible needs to afterwards because it

01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:58,430
it will take some time

01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:17,530
you can use the tool and with just two

01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:25,659
just passing the euro of the awesome

01:14:21,739 --> 01:14:25,659
video hit enter

01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:38,540
and you don't have to worry about a

01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:38,540
resolution or format

01:14:53,540 --> 01:15:01,050
status error is more like it do what you

01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:04,980
can when where you can use when you need

01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:13,530
to debug something for example you have

01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:20,840
to you are looking for some response 400

01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:20,840
I mean HTTP status

01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,280
Oh

01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:45,659
I do apologize this will not work at

01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:56,699
this moment but you can try it on your

01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:59,940
own sigil is pretty handy tool if you

01:15:56,699 --> 01:16:03,989
have some bunch of photos and want to

01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:06,559
share it to address as the HTML or

01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:06,559
gallery

01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,480
so

01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:29,760
run signal in it be sure which creates

01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:33,810
some default configuration the imported

01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:37,050
line is here source which is the name of

01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:42,240
folder for the pictures I mean the

01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:47,130
content sigil built will create all

01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:54,260
static HTML files and also there is also

01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:54,260
built-in web server for presentation

01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:08,059
it also contains full screen mode I just

01:17:01,429 --> 01:17:11,900
press F like a full screen what's also

01:17:08,059 --> 01:17:16,570
nice that it's text Cara world

01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,570
exposition if it's available

01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:30,830
I have some few things for your terminal

01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:36,790
by child will let you in your Python

01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:36,790
scripts create colorful output

01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:55,340
so the output kind of looks like this

01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:58,910
and the usage is pretty easy you can

01:17:55,340 --> 01:18:08,120
also specify some formatting options as

01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:12,250
a sickness or underscoring our ad it can

01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,250
be called as a console highlighter

01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:26,650
it also contains interactive mode for

01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:30,380
creating new rules for example

01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:34,600
highlighting hex numbers which will

01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,600
match this pattern

01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:51,070
we can state it I already had prepared

01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:53,310
drew which is named work for this

01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:53,310
purpose

01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:17,370
so it works this way or you can also use

01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:25,020
it for highlighting your locks this is

01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:30,980
some simple input and also can looks

01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:30,980
like this because of these rules

01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:40,350
the last package that I'd like to show

01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:43,600
you is convey cpu which is actually

01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:47,889
implementation of game of life that you

01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:52,110
may be no actually I'm going to consider

01:19:47,889 --> 01:19:52,110
this like a screensaver

01:19:56,810 --> 01:20:01,030
yeah I will need another terminal for

01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:01,030
this

01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:18,860
it looks like a mess what if I do some

01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:18,860
load on the processor

01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:33,230
it starts changing a lot because

01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:37,130
according to load during new seeds will

01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:40,820
appear them it's also this it can be

01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:46,420
distinguished by different color if I

01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:46,420
kill it it starts slow down

01:20:52,760 --> 01:21:00,260
no it's not random there is algorithm

01:20:55,770 --> 01:21:04,710
why some pixels are appear and disappear

01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:10,650
it's not so it looks like a random girls

01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:12,840
but it isn't during work on this topic

01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:22,980
wasn't hurt even close Anna's oh jeez or

01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:26,280
snake I promise so remember this fightin

01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:31,550
will not bite you bitin can be your

01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,550
friend thank you for attention

01:21:54,699 --> 01:22:03,860
sure I didn't notice that but i think

01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:08,239
that on pi PI there can be some fighting

01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:11,510
some package for this actually on my

01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:16,330
ipod there is several thousands all the

01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:19,099
thousands of packages and it's

01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:22,550
impossible to just browse over the

01:22:19,099 --> 01:22:25,610
ballgame but here the rest is also

01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:33,610
pretty famous for more than I hope that

01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:33,610
there would be something for that yes

01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:48,409
yeah actually I try that it's spin I

01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:51,949
spent a lot of time by by that actually

01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:55,880
all the packages I found on Twitter of

01:22:51,949 --> 01:23:00,550
the pie pie and also i do recommend to

01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:05,179
buy own pi 0 m TW which stands for

01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:08,860
fightin module of the week i think there

01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:14,560
is a lot of examples documented examples

01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:19,360
for also for buildings especially and

01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:23,630
and yeah there are several other

01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:28,270
resources that I are used but there is

01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:28,270
not not all done

01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:34,710
so

01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:53,760
I'm sure that there exists other tools

01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:57,000
that does the same I'd like to show just

01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:59,420
one example in fightin that's I've

01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,420
noticed

01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:21,469
we don't I didn't know that thank you it

01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,570
wouldn't be any other questions thank

01:24:21,469 --> 01:24:25,989
you again in for attention and injury

01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,989
difficult

01:24:50,410 --> 01:25:03,389
yeah it was completely fine using

01:24:56,550 --> 01:25:06,510
yes independent of the pages some of

01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:10,590
them are possible of libertinism I'd

01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:17,929
history but the most tools that I I've

01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:17,929
met mr. from vitamix points yeah

01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,540
Oh

01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:37,680
sinem two-legged really study dammit

01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:44,190
mama to tisha

01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:47,810
this isn't it with you okay cool I just

01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:47,810
