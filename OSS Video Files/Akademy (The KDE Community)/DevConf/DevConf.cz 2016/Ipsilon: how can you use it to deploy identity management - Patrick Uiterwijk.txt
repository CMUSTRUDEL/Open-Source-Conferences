Title: Ipsilon: how can you use it to deploy identity management - Patrick Uiterwijk
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	I have been a main contributor for the Ipsilon project for a long time, and would like to show people what it can do, and how they can use it to implement federated identities at their websites and APIs.
I will give a live demonstration of how to deploy it and set it up with one or two applications, and the new features.

The project is located on https://fedorahosted.org/ipsilon/.
