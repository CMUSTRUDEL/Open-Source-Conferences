Title: OpenQA - automated testing! - Ondřej Holeček
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Test your favorite OS or application in OpenQA!

OpenQA is automated testing framework backing openSUSE and SUSE distributions.
But by nature it is universal testing tool, just bring installation iso of your favorite OS and lets start.
I will cover basic openQA work and you will be able to write test for almost anything you want.

I will provide VM's with preinstalled openQA admin node and worker node, attendants will need own computer capable of KVM virtualization.

what everybody people come here as a

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:41,510
first portion this last day of the

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:45,350
conference and I will basically started

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:48,740
one thing there is an L of conference

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:52,550
that you can join at the end you

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,980
confront I things for Prairie where you

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,860
can visit some nice prizes like some

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,890
boards you cookies and stuff like that I

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:06,770
think you can find a description either

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:09,740
in books or white horse and let me pass

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:13,029
the word to unregular check so said

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,730
peewee developers or a ten year sorry

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:19,730
saucer engineer who works in open QA and

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:26,750
that will be his board ship okay good

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:30,160
morning this animal without considers

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,870
work for promotion video will be also

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:38,800
participated efforts of what we do and

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,800
for that's fine no just

00:09:48,520 --> 00:10:06,660
oh ok but I think wall system because

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:55,270
find this is possible to boot from the

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:58,270
steam no this one file opening a little

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:02,590
bit more which or contains further image

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,880
families sensor image and definition

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,710
file for the virtual machines

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:12,970
recognition if you want to wrap and what

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:17,460
would be somebody or using this if I you

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:20,320
know yeah okay okay so so this is just

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,970
exceptions were to a weapon you can have

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,880
contracted it in two different directory

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,570
but then you want to edit the

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,230
recognition part of it and all the rest

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,230
of you

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:49,550
I've always I'll just hold on either the

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,620
first two part so I was capable

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:56,130
installation and administration gets you

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,700
so this perfect size for our if we are

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:02,520
eternal training so it's little brother

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:07,530
but I don't need to do that sound today

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,570
so you know as far as of course probably

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:13,050
while you are on my presentation

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,960
yesterday this is just only do people

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,120
click on a picture what so how is still

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,270
architecture of the other open queuing

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,140
so we have administration out and we

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:28,140
have fui hello and a cow is small jolly

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,490
for a walk you home usually put 60 pero

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:35,730
based framework which looks like rails

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,800
it's fig need so oh it's tries to me

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,550
tell you about for back so they're so

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,530
arrays system works it provides the UI

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:48,060
follow is for the roster and of course

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:50,670
the rest okay rest api form for external

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:55,380
applications enjoy the motor then we

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:58,260
have xml option moon and WebSocket

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,860
server which is displayed here websites

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,650
different potentials and take the race

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,750
external on the working out we have the

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,820
water which is middleman between or

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:13,310
within a test engine which is always

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:17,940
open hands and read for application of

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:19,860
the dash line from the alternative a qi

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,070
it means that there are some situations

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:26,970
order sibilities vanilla or so tense can

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:30,270
talk and upload results and pascal from

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,490
stuff from directly from the web UI

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,870
without using the water interface or

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,450
middleman and it's used mainly in

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:45,200
ordination deaths and you are asking for

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:49,730
for the state of children jobs and so do

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,750
our purpose is the same lies on the

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,850
presentation Oh took into integration

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,120
testing a certain testing singular

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,089
automation testing you control it so

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,370
will you write the tests if you were

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:08,060
control it so the machine will buy

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,220
yourself so you are typical anderson

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,589
area when you are ready philotic news a

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,040
new tests you just do all the

00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:18,350
installation by hand for one machine at

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,690
X naught X logs what you watch kick

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,900
strokes you impressed what you P do what

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:29,420
you value click and so on and then just

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:33,380
write it down indo indo artist api so

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:37,750
this is basically looks like we have one

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:42,920
may notice boden scott Slama again and

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:49,430
so it's basically it i don't know how

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:51,890
many how much your tail so the 9pm is

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:56,720
not 0 it will execute it is only

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,310
required so if all the variables or all

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,800
the commands are not so in any

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:06,500
subroutine it's not exert the light

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,380
group main section so when it's required

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,910
in just goes and evaluates own variables

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:18,440
Oh using cool choppers and I load to

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,900
whatever test it so it's an iPod this

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,050
one goes well it's accessed by before

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:28,760
it's the variables it gets from from the

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:34,459
scheduler was later and then the test

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:38,089
itself are exactly there is so there is

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:40,520
no stay because there is a 10 30 Serrano

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:43,070
subroutine I don't know how many said

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,070
because they are executed for you every

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:52,150
test Nexus overrun supporting

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:52,150
and that's execute so this part of code

00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:02,200
yeah this is that the other things is a

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:06,320
noodles sure I would have created

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:09,380
screech yeah it's a basically scripture

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,100
speaks under some meta data where you

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,630
put the other you write the tag so we

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,550
can we have four different many

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,560
different creatures with the same time

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,870
so when you are matching this giving

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,600
shocks endure any test you just pull the

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,300
tech name and yet though just engine

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,200
will try each and every one every

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:36,070
screech also with the with the same time

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:38,810
achieve our destiny I saw some helpers

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:41,900
we tried to use that the best idea

00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:45,860
itself is so distribution or oils

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:50,900
agnostic so in theory open Oh test even

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:56,180
windows so no just an ascent on using

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:57,980
for open q8 on opensuse and put a ball

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,220
for deposit and blew it we actually have

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,950
tests which tested while booting it

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,250
doesn't do anything fancy with windows

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,980
what so he's still start to move aside

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:14,180
to move it and chapter it's actually

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:16,970
working after though to ensure that the

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,730
menu in style tumblr veto network with

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,480
machine gets it falls through up your

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,480
window vista windows installation

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:35,140
so this is so prepare to just kind of

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,960
finding anything because so I usually

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,730
will speak about tests and then somehow

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:48,370
i switch to jobs and so the the test is

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:54,880
on a hundred eco this is like compare if

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:57,070
you compare the oh yeah the process edge

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,350
of the statistics processes to call you

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,110
execute some binary it becomes the

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:06,130
process so job is a test which is

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:10,780
remaining that is only the code so

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:14,590
that's where i will open ocean URL

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,200
generator all things you it will you

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,750
will want we will want to test if he

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,039
acts regenerated jobs he generated from

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:32,700
the test hope yeah just to be on the

00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:32,700
same page with originating yeah

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:42,930
concept is the variables and the

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:46,230
variables divided into several

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:49,590
categories they actually are you can now

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,890
choose whatever category you want and

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,220
put everything in okay that's not so you

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,200
have to put all hardware related things

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,670
into machines you can put everything

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:06,120
just one but so we were suppose to

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:09,600
divide it so it's more logical to well

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,550
for some variables to influence the

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,970
creation virtual machines it's all in

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:17,610
the pink machine stables and 0 which it

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,520
burns at a desk the best auto expo job

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:23,580
flow in the destitute and medium times

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:31,110
with you influence the for example the

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:34,980
installation items and so on then the

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:39,510
job groups initially oh it all was so

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:44,550
done automatically but we then changed

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:47,130
it a little vinegar manually so that if

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,920
you thought doesn't do every combination

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:54,660
but you can fetch up groups when we

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,910
specify which for which machine or from

00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,600
the define from the tables run on only

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:03,210
the specific test case so you so you

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:08,700
don't have to always do the same thing

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:13,380
so how to should I break every possible

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,660
combination yeah this was sort of you

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,890
just have so it's all get your group you

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:22,830
will find the machines now x86 32 bit or

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:27,000
our armor then you have test pc test

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:29,030
tubes and then you just an angle oh yeah

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,190
there are pictures are from the movie

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:35,300
you arrested enable machines for the

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:38,210
world nation of data should wear a bit

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:45,770
so i generate the proper it's a couple

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:51,640
jobs yeah probably i will i cannot show

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,640
you how we use it your war

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,860
so it wasn't click more

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,910
just a little bit Wi-Fi will be working

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:27,700
ok it looking like a new person oh ok

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,700
yeah yeah great less if you use ok ok

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,440
quite connection deactivated

00:21:51,020 --> 00:22:00,260
also that should work yeah I wrong it's

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,260
cool that's what manager is complaining

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:16,330
have you tested it yep my time already

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,330
I'm trying to login

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,240
in the meantime like it's generally

00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:42,200
found open another top here as I will I

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:44,330
knew oh when you lose the machine I gave

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,009
you from our mistakes it will

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:51,950
automatically start with you I and

00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:53,899
apache on which uses a proxy for it or

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,620
product because I will review is an

00:22:53,899 --> 00:23:02,450
ankle some always about hosting some

00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:06,379
report when you open it it's completely

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,950
empty you can you will be initially

00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:12,350
locked out but we support so very

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,320
various so out the duplication my

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,909
talking for this one is the fake

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,250
identification is an ipod so when you

00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:23,019
click the quick just log in you'll be

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,039
able to close the demo user and

00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:31,659
admitting balls admin section there is

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:34,759
so there are the tables down mca here

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:37,159
you know because it's been with

00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:42,139
installation but so it's basically you

00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:48,139
can you cannot although all the

00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:51,820
variables you want you will show you

00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,820
even once i look through

00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:02,500
very well but

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:15,300
oh yeah this is already look so in a in

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,890
a recent origins in a job groups when

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,559
you have feel like a circuit you created

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:23,640
new google group then you if you have

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:28,130
defined machines and so on let's go and

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,130
it will allows you to create connections

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,030
what

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:50,580
did you manage to stop it okay I was

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,590
hoping we will write some tests together

00:24:50,580 --> 00:25:02,040
but that's where I can only show you we

00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:04,980
do it for example yeah I will continue

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:11,520
the way to the the presentation because

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:14,490
I ok so this is the pill so much in

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,710
tables to see the back end so you don't

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,590
need to specify if you don't specify it

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:25,550
it wasn't it to be Q but you can have

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:29,460
the powerpc s390 it may for Naga resting

00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:31,200
the border cause I will get to it that's

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,870
a good thing to distinguish when you

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,210
have some specific configuration on some

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:38,670
hardware or some work for some little

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:43,290
machines so that you can use water class

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:48,600
20 limits or some tests only to be run

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:50,160
on this one on this set of workers where

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,190
we're going to miss you require users to

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:57,060
specify the water yeah networking the

00:25:53,190 --> 00:26:00,690
different working its own and it does

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:05,370
suit you see the signs of use the

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:09,870
logical things you expect to envision it

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,700
plans to support pole and media so the

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:16,470
assets tables are generated

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:19,920
automatically from the then you should

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,610
do it wiser or something to build to

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,530
have it will create so because of when

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,630
you should go rated you need to put some

00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,240
mandatory mandatory options which are

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,570
the architecture the flavor version

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,610
under this tree this tree is so anyway

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:40,350
we organize all the test or test so we

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:45,180
already in different distribute this

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:47,850
trip for our directories so when you

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,920
have tests for windows and that you test

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:53,149
for desk for something looks cool stuff

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,519
you put a bit different directors and

00:26:53,149 --> 00:27:01,820
this straight hood it's to differentiate

00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:04,219
between them and job groups who created

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,820
you jump ropes and it will show you how

00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:10,159
to the arcs from the medium which is a

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,639
su creditable job group and then there

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,409
is a button to associate asset of the

00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:23,899
medium of vintage group you can ask nor

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:26,239
mediums to one cup group but yeah oh

00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:30,849
it's so little confusing because so I

00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:33,679
know it when I am doing this at work

00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:39,249
almost no one or get it from the first

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:42,049
time and so I I understand but that's

00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:49,159
one summer you get used to it it's so

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:52,269
make sure you would good sense right so

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,269
we manage it to him

00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:02,430
oh I'm inside the link so when you can

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:04,860
now look for the test all the star on

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,530
the top I think this so Luke is still

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,870
correct like for fedoras I guess is

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:15,270
already installed without a fedora test

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:16,830
you can see oh yeah you probably don't

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,790
get this one because this is late an

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,730
hour so you can get so goes for opensuse

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,640
and that's the test so we actually share

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,010
it as a test video sleaze and soap and

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,830
since I sold the Fedora Eagles are in

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:35,760
the floor does to your casa yeah we had

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:45,320
four different it died out for this so

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:45,320
we can take this yeah it's Logan

00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:06,200
almost second come after you to find the

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:11,269
machine do reverse define the XML you

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:14,690
can semester before I think what I like

00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:18,879
you have you doing it for web manager

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,879
yes a little bit manager you can open it

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,500
Oh

00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,179
this is so I'm clocked in it this is

00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:57,129
from the of the actual elephants deserve

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:59,229
this so is so like this updates and so

00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:02,399
on some actual job groups when you

00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:09,939
create a job group it will create also

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:12,009
to create them in the overview so this

00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:18,399
also purpose of the reviews to organize

00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:29,829
and you know so you can see but so some

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:33,129
blue good overview oh we are on the

00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:35,169
github a shit-eating so it's a real

00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:38,639
stretch of the network is much more

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,639
water for me

00:30:46,039 --> 00:31:04,649
uploads so I will over here here so this

00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:08,059
is a show you know npm which is the

00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:13,590
Lotus older for photo opens is a test

00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:20,239
it's quite so long but hope I have a

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:23,909
show with behind a moment in the actual

00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:27,210
layout at Musil the test we are actual

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,759
test so we have a late but we right now

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:33,059
when you want to create some your

00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,869
library or some helpers for your tests

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:38,999
we put it in English and so I

00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:41,909
automatically appendix to the pedal

00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:45,239
search path over like the risk for

00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:47,849
modules the latest thing is where you

00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:49,859
put some static help static that I

00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:54,749
removed for test for that when you want

00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:58,619
to download some some data two parts on

00:31:54,749 --> 00:32:00,960
the disconnection we put it in data and

00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,389
then our two slightly higher functions

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,099
which interacts which helps to download

00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:09,570
so some stuff to the testing machines

00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:12,739
they are automatically gathered from the

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:15,739
the data architecture a diff data

00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:15,739
directory

00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:30,379
so I can say if anyone is like a little

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,759
overwhelmed with all this it is nice we

00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:33,409
found when we start that we don't need

00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,929
to know all of these things it's quite

00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:38,769
easy to set up one or two tests and all

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:41,210
the combinatorial variables you can just

00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:42,739
go by trial and error until we get

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,269
through it and then you get two or three

00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:45,889
tests running and a lot of this stuff is

00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:48,110
just what you need when you get bigger

00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:49,999
and you kind of figure it out it makes

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,169
sense as you get more tests building

00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:55,789
right but you don't need to know it all

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:58,429
to start out yeah it's a tool i have

00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:03,919
twenty-five bucks windows open now so i

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:06,340
get to post here that's not what anyone

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,340
played

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:32,140
yeah perfect so okay only I can I will

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,680
just have initial to grab the test and

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:46,030
then we can see how to break it up and

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:51,700
then going to find where is it yeah hey

00:33:46,030 --> 00:34:00,070
so there is the presentation from this

00:33:51,700 --> 00:34:02,770
whole bit so this is a so Adam also gave

00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:05,410
up you can run a repair job so in two

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,240
different place and you want to use all

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,169
this distribution for metals from the

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,090
tables you will like it ran 18 as I call

00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:16,090
it a tie so centric approach you just

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:20,500
get a new you also annual no image you

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:23,710
go build and with our API you just

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,110
shuttle to posit that I have basically

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,179
side I have this new image and should

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:31,179
check out all the jobs you can find for

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:35,020
it and then we have the jobs injury and

00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:38,770
you can now play just just 10 just one

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:43,530
hour job and you want you even need to

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,530
anything in also in those tables

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,859
this is the form for the isos you put it

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:03,880
into the deeper I directory for

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:07,000
laid-open create factorial so oh this is

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,930
the directory it is usually share that

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,640
because we need some come on some shared

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,310
storage between the blue you three mode

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,829
holders so this basically is exported to

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:21,460
server NFS and whatever you want to use

00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:23,460
a slow and gets it so liberal file

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,050
system and it's an object storage and

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:30,520
then well you created 3 poster for

00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:34,660
created a post request with your eyes as

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:37,869
part of the mandatory or we were

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:40,150
variable variables and it will visible

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,160
create whatever just inverted to how

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,369
many tests it's actually created and I

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:51,300
beasts of the test its own backyard

00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:54,730
Jason Vermont on the other hand the

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:58,510
holding the door test you will salute

00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:01,270
job so pass for a post command but you

00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,770
it doesn't consult anything from from

00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,839
the tables it completely ignored the

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:08,800
tables so you will need to specify all

00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:11,530
the variables yourself oh there is one

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,260
we live around for death and that is

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:17,680
when you use the isos 1 i'll just post

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:22,900
man and specify the test worry above it

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:26,500
and the test nine you want to create you

00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,810
all want to show you and it will take

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,270
all the things from the tables or all

00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:36,130
the tables you wear but on schedule only

00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:38,349
one the one test is specified and the

00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:40,569
reason we do this because with this

00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:42,880
release approach and you have the multi

00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:47,050
machine tests to create only one and you

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,140
need so it's very hard so to create

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,080
automation

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:55,840
using this because when you specify it

00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:58,790
in the variables you just said you just

00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,590
say that I want this test to be run with

00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:05,030
this size with the time you have written

00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:07,490
test tubes but internally when the tests

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:12,340
are created to compare gave it as a joke

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:14,780
all these so all these so blames to

00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:19,240
between this column you can adjust our

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,240
platforms to the edge of IDs so when you

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:36,020
get a chance and so when you want to

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,390
make around and use this one or multi

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:41,090
machine test look you will create the

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,250
one each one is one job will return the

00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:46,550
ID and then you will create a new one

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:50,090
and you just need to other special

00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:54,290
variable she's underscore Oh parallel on

00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:58,280
underscore jobs or run to score a run

00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:01,190
run after jobs and you put the ID of the

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,510
previously created so really Nicki so

00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,250
that's why there is the middle ground

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,160
with your Isis post when you specify

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,050
only one test nine but it will also be

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,960
detects that there is some dependent

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:16,970
tests or parenthetical to around there

00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,920
also so that's the side that is very

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:27,320
quickly why don't you want to run it but

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:29,390
yeah it's all in a panel a try and get a

00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:34,670
folder when you are going to Destin

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:37,730
already running now we also know spy

00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:41,870
software stardom or as we call home then

00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:44,240
all the either using the few I what you

00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:47,360
need to be locked in a little bit at

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,320
least operates or so identification

00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:54,470
level to do that the same guys when you

00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,500
want to run it from them from the

00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,570
command line the reliance creek actually

00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,230
it's not the stairs

00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:06,300
no magic in the only thing is that the

00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:10,660
two-part this one instead of the path of

00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:13,360
the rest man it's only the clients only

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:18,510
Leo reads configuration so it knows

00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:21,760
we're on what what was name is so is the

00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:24,250
open tray on the RVP used for

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,280
authentication and click and we all the

00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:33,040
rest of the / IP API / version 1 /

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,500
depart so which will prepare directed it

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,020
ok to complete an hour prestbury and

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:42,850
this is the method views you can expose

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:45,460
to get put the beat it's in the

00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:49,030
destination oh there is the clowns

00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:53,650
reporter and which are which can claw

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:55,300
all the good jobs but what con job can

00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,390
also do is for example then you have a

00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,670
cure-all instance running and you want

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:04,120
to plow jobs draw from different of

00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,760
thank you a instant you can specify the

00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,560
punjab the chicken from this URL from

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,160
this instant from the open quranic on

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,540
this URL clone it to my open

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,430
acquaintance as it's running on

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,250
different URL and if the good actually

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:20,380
asked so the remote open play

00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,750
installation what all the remembers you

00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:26,170
do what you need what assets you need

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:30,340
and so on it downloads it and push it so

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:33,210
you can clone from from different open

00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,210
QA installations

00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:43,740
okay so intersection yeah also ordered

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,370
to how to write a test I started from

00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:50,250
the easiest way and that's how to enable

00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:53,220
it our time to just when my failing

00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:59,940
tests so you need to update the screen

00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:05,700
shots only yeah this is again I so I was

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:13,560
talking again reiterating just so so we

00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:15,780
remember it and yeah this is the three

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,260
things i go for the graphic honest match

00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,000
that's so that's when for example the

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,970
new branding comes in you need to change

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,490
only only we're all screenshots port

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:29,790
flow change and you need to put some new

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:32,970
commands in it you know for example but

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:36,990
the license or added license are going

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:40,050
to our diplomats and the completely

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:43,020
missing the reception let's have a pass

00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:45,210
you got for it for is what first to you

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,550
usually don't need to mess with my ppl

00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,790
or when you are working completely new

00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:55,830
testimony to you right there and the

00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:59,430
dead the problem is that's a we as for

00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:03,870
opensuse ties have so much for its and

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:07,020
so many base classes for for the tests

00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:09,360
that you that the way we actually write

00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,620
the opposite test if you want to try it

00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:16,049
in a from scratch you will find that

00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:21,689
missing so much stuff so

00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:23,479
yeah that's before sometimes it's

00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:26,749
necessary how I'm to write it left

00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:33,119
clicking the new it that's good what

00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:36,410
enticing i do right yeah before how we

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,799
can even the time i was wrong we need to

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:47,839
see what's where the problem is so the

00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:52,799
job can be okay file or are soft 50

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:55,949
modules are the chopped' file yo past

00:42:52,799 --> 00:43:00,749
and filed its sorta sponsoring soft

00:42:55,949 --> 00:43:03,479
files is when the wii during the test

00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:07,109
detected that we need to use some

00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:09,869
workarounds to get so so we know that

00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:13,529
there is a bug but we know how to work

00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:19,140
around it and i can continue so when we

00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:21,239
are our do this work around we do things

00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,089
we can mike monkey that so this

00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:30,469
basically we use for ground so it's like

00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:33,749
it fast but yes so oh okay it is still

00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:36,660
in decided to use the author is also

00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:41,959
close what with this color is so now

00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,959
although about greenish-yellow now box

00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:52,520
and you may also see these so icons that

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:57,780
can be three of them and it depends a

00:43:52,520 --> 00:44:00,540
this one is the importance of the longer

00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:04,200
of the test so for example it will not

00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:08,400
abort the whole test the whole jump job

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:11,640
but once it once failed even if

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:16,080
everything all Ellis passed from the

00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:20,310
overall result which will fail Oh a

00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:25,080
little harsher is the is the fat out

00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:27,420
flock if it fails it supports ho test

00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:32,280
and it doesn't even try to continue real

00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:37,920
life and the milestone oh this is awful

00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:40,740
I can eat so individual even you went

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:46,080
this module when district module though

00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:50,359
is fast it will create a snapshot for of

00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,950
the current state and when the

00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:55,950
automatically wet weather us define any

00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,230
other variables or not it will always

00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,780
create suction and effect is that then

00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:05,670
in the next time when someone you'll

00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:09,240
fail even if it's important or not but

00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:11,190
the fix failed the test engine will

00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,200
automatically reload from blast good

00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:17,730
snapshot and try to continue from that

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,630
one so it's a choice sometimes to revert

00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:26,760
to someone now working no state and see

00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:29,450
what's whether it will work its way for

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,450
the rest of the test

00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:37,529
in the photo needles week when you have

00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:41,249
your selected files test you will then

00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:46,109
see all the needles the green one our

00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:49,379
past the red ones are fail oh I will

00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:53,129
spell saying cutter there are the tags

00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:55,829
so let me go only like the Texan it's

00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:59,759
basically this is the algorithm oh so

00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:03,089
it's so matching very different skin

00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:11,159
choice with a sign talk it's can dry

00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:12,959
sand Oh Joe it takes just 10 fix also

00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,079
part of the or meta data is matching

00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:17,609
area for example when you really

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,349
generally don't want too much whole

00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:22,619
screen for example where the time is

00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:26,339
changing your good needs it will won't

00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:28,919
much anywhere else no and it won't make

00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:32,039
sure at all if you you are comparing the

00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:37,279
ball screen so we just specify the

00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:41,459
region we want to to be matched and

00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:49,409
that's all part of the egos I will just

00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:51,589
quickly check how are we undo okay I'm

00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,589
just

00:46:52,250 --> 00:47:10,090
oh ok finally locked in so stop it in

00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:17,000
time yeah I wanted to shoulder the RO

00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:22,490
how our tables look like I may open this

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,600
one just stressed as the Wi-Fi open it

00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,600
in the integra

00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,529
so you

00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:52,610
so this is so updater updating our laws

00:47:49,580 --> 00:48:01,370
we have some fancy things like a little

00:47:52,610 --> 00:48:04,010
which looks really oh damn thing so you

00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:07,520
basically need to go splat some basic

00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:12,320
portfolio for that this is you can see

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:16,150
that that is the screens usernames

00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:21,830
automatically artist here are the tags

00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:24,560
no screens and very readable seems but

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:27,470
so you basically all of the texan visor

00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,620
i already sample time we can copy them

00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:32,870
visually from other existing or art or

00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:35,240
so here is the warcraft property which

00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:41,590
will Marcus of fire this new garage

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:44,180
which is and so this is the way you

00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:49,310
update you just select the wrong

00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:51,380
screenshot here this is the only

00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:53,690
existing speech once on the first one is

00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:58,190
through one which was captured in just

00:48:53,690 --> 00:49:01,990
your breath res the most up-to-date you

00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:05,180
can specify our new matching areas or

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:09,200
copy machine areas from santander needle

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,500
when I met the ex like this one means I

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,440
copulate retching here

00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:17,610
this one is new and the same when I

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,810
select the tax i just copied beer from

00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:25,140
that and i don't have to invent my home

00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:27,740
and then you just say open to it can be

00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:31,260
configured so ultimately to push this

00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:33,630
this changes to a triple if you make for

00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:37,950
endorsing you know its own repository

00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:40,980
for open to the music on shortly so when

00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:43,560
you try to help and update something

00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:46,020
finally Nicholas savory it doesn't occur

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:50,550
pushed it if it so it's the out of LAX

00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:54,690
automatically deploy on the system so

00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:58,680
quick is it and what if I heard oh I

00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:01,890
don't yeah dude oh how we matching what

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,560
is the tude a little worried about the

00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:06,930
expressive location right where you put

00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,090
the National agent because the American

00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,560
previous slide or a little bit back

00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:14,690
where it was explaining matching yes

00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:19,830
yeah it is ah great as I thought yes

00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:22,770
yeah so this is what it started with

00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:25,050
look but when you expect to be but if

00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,510
it's not there it's just making going

00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:32,370
spiral motion and expanding expanding

00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:34,230
search area and when it's so fitting the

00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:36,720
time out its Charlie's just the whole

00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:41,460
screen and just try to find it somewhere

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:43,080
else there so it's reusable like when

00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:46,920
the scripts for every when you are

00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,510
checking for some of it though text data

00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,510
in from the law and you are using a

00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:53,550
screen shots for that too and if you

00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,020
don't have to worry that sometimes it to

00:50:53,550 --> 00:51:00,540
the end of the screen sometimes it's on

00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:06,060
the top and so don't just have your big

00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:09,660
needles what s called we go to work for

00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:11,730
usually with the pilot module with the

00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:15,480
path needle there is the scope so that a

00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:19,370
cote d'ivoire just for viewer which is

00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,370
always today and do I

00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:33,070
here wet

00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:45,390
so you are when you re also tools to

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,819
have to find resveratrol aerotropolis I

00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:50,130
love with needles or window videos are

00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:53,640
the only the outer and slow gets off

00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:57,900
from the test engineer when if there is

00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:02,369
test code at all oh you just need so to

00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:11,400
obey this module make a better get up

00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:13,859
somewhere right I'm taking someone give

00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,280
me a second I have to go to a balanced

00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:18,960
or we run open QA on fedora we'd love to

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,280
have helped if anyone is inspired by

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,180
this you can get in touch with me

00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,190
anytime and now you know I'll walk you

00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,329
through helping with our open QA and any

00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,950
questions you have the point you down

00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:30,960
for the workers we have a package for

00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,099
pedor with you so I'm item Williamson

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,160
for anyone who doesn't know me I'm

00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:39,230
around a conference and I'm google thank

00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:43,400
you oh I had my control the actual I

00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,400
don't need to get up right

00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:59,680
plus a tease this is actually update

00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,640
so

00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:34,640
this is how our world alongside

00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:41,609
basically this is some helpers we want

00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:44,429
either usual usually so trite as all

00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:47,910
this is for you for cleaning it's still

00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:51,749
and basically starts always ask for

00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:59,039
we're so variables which they are set or

00:53:51,749 --> 00:54:05,969
not we have also somehow predator oh you

00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:07,890
can ask him yeah this this is just

00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:10,439
setting some other we can't check out

00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:16,160
okay you can get variables you can set

00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:20,519
doing doing this better multiply or so

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:23,009
all this is part of this API all the

00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:27,119
recommendation for test applies and you

00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:29,939
know I in the test engine or cold it's

00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:33,329
so plain old a spider bite so it's all

00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:38,489
the ODI and you can explore its

00:54:33,329 --> 00:54:41,789
cool she started passwords in impacts

00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:45,029
directly you somehow encrypted before

00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:47,969
shooter games almost done to this one

00:54:45,029 --> 00:54:52,709
for test these are visible in our github

00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:55,229
too but is only only in our our test

00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:58,469
missions and were you and have somewhere

00:54:55,229 --> 00:55:00,269
SSH private key during behalf but did

00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:02,689
sit for is for testing I know that he

00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:07,369
will get to some statistics about it but

00:55:02,689 --> 00:55:07,369
but that's a never use anywhere

00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:19,380
and the event it looks like this it's

00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:22,000
the loads all the things you want

00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:24,310
important thing is that this code is

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,650
executed before the virtual machine is

00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:28,920
running so you don't have access to

00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:34,270
anything or advanced check or anything

00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:36,790
go regarding like the tested system also

00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:43,150
don't use any sleeps here and so on

00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:46,540
because it so then walks miles music and

00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:48,940
for the actual test you can sleep

00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:51,550
without the object for upgrade of the

00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:55,990
system is it for roughly so you know if

00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:58,540
you have zipper it's like apt-get or get

00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:01,120
so far inside by package a sensor and

00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,880
you can do also a distribution i'm

00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:08,830
getting sick about this using this now

00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:10,570
you see so it's okay that all this is

00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:12,700
the reticular i'm going to do this way

00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,210
so in some ways and that means that so

00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:18,100
we are not using the bass tester shipped

00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:23,170
with oil which test engine itself but

00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:25,090
you are using some our own helper which

00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:30,130
already provides some functions which

00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:33,970
are which show may be used here and so

00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:38,680
then we use of this IP I and this is the

00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:43,000
main run we have some pic on politics is

00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:46,690
here from the pedal and when this crisp

00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:51,460
is bio when say it's pizza it actually

00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:53,860
you is that so XO type this command

00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:58,720
they're using the keyboard where you're

00:56:53,860 --> 00:57:01,810
going CEO on the destination but there

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,720
is eliminated it is personal checks

00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:10,390
window when do the script is finished it

00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:13,180
will automatically up and the most other

00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,330
direction for sell your console without

00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:19,190
I guess

00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:21,170
the of the come on so when you love

00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:26,720
serving the screenshot swagger eat it is

00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:29,180
this oh it's a come on finish but one of

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,070
the description doesn't doesn't change

00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,200
but it doesn't check whether it was

00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:36,380
successful or not we can have a third

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:41,780
script run which go to the test if it

00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:45,140
fires are there so also betting that the

00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:48,350
script out the event oh oh it's part of

00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:51,500
the test i PR it uses so you know

00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:53,840
specifics Oh specific things so for

00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,540
example you don't you can't use skipped

00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,110
run on Windows machine you need to do so

00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:02,840
type string which just died within our

00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:06,640
or creates override it and created or

00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:10,040
others and so this is all

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:16,730
object-oriented pebble in the way in the

00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:18,760
most basic way no no oh no so yeah

00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:23,360
battle had some strange ways to use

00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:31,390
analytics outside so you can override so

00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:35,210
some functions I very conduct basically

00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:40,670
the same you can send wait for the

00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:43,190
seller output with it so just fades and

00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:46,130
our products from I got all after the

00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:50,180
this command is a finished it click it

00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:55,370
sets the pointer to fight not the point

00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:58,130
to run by the position oh you are you

00:58:55,370 --> 00:59:02,180
open the folder yeah its seat at the end

00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:05,650
of the end of the file which it's a

00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:09,350
gathering there Sarah output and Oh

00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:11,810
between this round and this run you know

00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:14,420
this one and see only what what's what's

00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:16,539
happened was appendix to the smile after

00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:20,079
after 10 copies

00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:22,390
see also it doesn't match all the

00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:26,259
previous stuff so it can be quite sure

00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:28,900
that so anything happens it can be so b

00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:40,239
school cause is the new stuff and not

00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:45,429
not the one that is just just flex you

00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:49,539
can set all although whether it should

00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:53,709
have aborted a suit or not this is still

00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:57,189
really now we have our not documented

00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:59,079
but like your best practice thing miss

00:59:57,189 --> 01:00:02,890
practice things you don't actually need

00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:05,919
to set our favor and important into one

01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:08,019
big concepts and let you know in I don't

01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:11,380
leave you a capital test it's also an

01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:14,469
important one also many tests one half

01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:18,069
these tests wise at all Eva and then

01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:21,579
even though or some important Lexi said

01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:27,279
it's because it's usually done in the

01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:31,359
bass test which we are getting from so

01:00:27,279 --> 01:00:35,559
this you see the two very operating this

01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,779
with call it so just look at the start

01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:41,439
and writers do the stuff as you would

01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:44,279
expect when you are given in the machine

01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:44,279
yourselves

01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:53,740
so still up here we had some result

01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,740
partially loaded

01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,530
I

01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:09,820
or is it from yesterday yeah this is a

01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:11,830
how you check the results the good thing

01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,290
is that so when you have the weights

01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:17,800
when you wait for you sorry output Excel

01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:22,090
ultimately so in the into the

01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:25,600
screenshots will bring to the thing it's

01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:32,020
captured on this area all food let's

01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:34,330
start let's come on once again so

01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,580
just for the swab it here which are you

01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:42,310
just update update you heard of the best

01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:44,650
it's out in front of from scratch and

01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:49,720
create the desk from scratch you need to

01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:55,860
create completely destroyed s folder so

01:01:49,720 --> 01:02:00,790
i was saying also oh do when i was so

01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:02,740
recurring this integral and you are

01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:06,690
trying to write to test from looks great

01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:15,940
I seem to use someone so many helpers oh

01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:17,860
we wait to see you even out even out of

01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,080
the solar and let somebody help so many

01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,550
helpers that so when we get used to

01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,770
forget when you start working on a

01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:26,350
federal stylist and then you will stay

01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:30,040
also used mining out or something you

01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:34,060
will want to try completely yo mr. boo

01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:40,630
with new test it's actually sometimes

01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:45,400
famously you we need to learn basics you

01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:49,570
just so you need to be a very far off so

01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:55,780
I both federal guys an open City guys we

01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:59,470
are using so many so many predictor we

01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:01,660
need to be watch for that oh this is the

01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:04,630
best structure or it all the ballgame

01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:07,510
this is one of the things because for

01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:11,650
when you work I was throwing this power

01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:12,210
00 first older you just use both

01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:15,930
testable

01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:19,680
because we have helper which it so also

01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:23,490
this so that you don't need to preface

01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:26,880
it with that just bit module which is

01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:29,849
probably a bad thing because we should

01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:36,780
put it s exported symbol into the output

01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:42,300
i spot one 630 I saw me what is this in

01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:49,290
this sauce why it is its curriculum so

01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:52,920
this is all going to solder again

01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:57,180
reiterating oh that's a low machine is

01:03:52,920 --> 01:04:01,380
not running so so you can't check

01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:11,849
anything except different variables and

01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:16,770
that that's it yes it load of shortest

01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:21,119
oh you don't need to you so you're

01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:23,640
strict here because so we are unable 8

01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,010
by default in our base test and all the

01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:28,560
tests which which inherits from it's

01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:33,210
automatically at the street and boarding

01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:37,530
snow enabled so we give something like

01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:40,260
model power module and then he'll

01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:43,730
basically a photo at least I PR gossard

01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:47,369
screen is to check her the screen shows

01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:50,430
this is the type of the over nido we

01:04:47,369 --> 01:04:53,400
want to check against xelement step

01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:58,080
program it so what it does it start

01:04:53,400 --> 01:05:01,740
extending no but I expect that you are

01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:08,190
in the San graphical environment over

01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:10,500
again highly specific the same come

01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:13,890
route and this is this is the only thing

01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:16,920
for from us ice cream a touch screen is

01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,730
universal so you can now use it on your

01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,000
dependent

01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:23,000
you know different voices the rest our

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
weary

01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:42,359
here again the only mandatory was

01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:45,269
working the desk 5 solo it's also well

01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:50,789
you know you need to enter it from at

01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:56,910
least bass test this test is so i can

01:05:50,789 --> 01:06:02,400
show you this is beauty of hope and

01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:12,650
solid i can show you all the sources so

01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:19,470
this is a pettist engine and a bass test

01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:24,539
this source for 40 a real test is so

01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:29,099
it's called space that's all Prince

01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:31,410
little you kind of can get statistics

01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:37,160
even in tests what if you want to go to

01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:47,450
it's not for me is also defined so sum

01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:47,450
sum over some helpers

01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:59,470
just practice yeah this is a good at all

01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,079
we have books which you can run before

01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:09,049
the test then when justice run this is

01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:12,259
basically it in the test itself you put

01:07:09,049 --> 01:07:14,539
the prayer around three Walker

01:07:12,259 --> 01:07:17,089
subroutine and it could be run it will

01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:21,019
run before test then of course plan and

01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:27,170
then we have failed hello when it fails

01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:29,869
you can post fail oh you all I can put

01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:32,869
it in your test cases just modules and

01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:35,739
execute them all together not what I

01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:41,230
wanted to show it except the test a PRA

01:07:35,739 --> 01:07:41,230
there is also a distribution

01:07:42,249 --> 01:07:51,529
distribution fee which is full or rather

01:07:48,440 --> 01:08:01,220
just API usually sometimes 404 basic

01:07:51,529 --> 01:08:04,849
things it will all set I would say it

01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:06,589
would have this API has some low-level

01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:09,710
stuff like the type string casa screen

01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:12,559
and then this is excellent or installed

01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:15,969
and become moot and so on it's a check

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:19,909
so if you have some question

01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:22,850
distribution which which inherits from

01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:25,880
this distribution and this is why this

01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:27,969
is the where you would want to override

01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,369
for example when you are preparing for

01:08:27,969 --> 01:08:35,420
one trying to test windows you will

01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:37,759
create a new list with Windows

01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:41,290
distribution of Windows forever inherit

01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:46,210
from this one and overrides the cedar

01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:49,190
the helpers and then you can use it even

01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:54,699
five sipi but you need to at first

01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:59,920
override it and in

01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:59,920
tests I didn't show you what

01:09:13,179 --> 01:09:23,219
looking fit okay in the loader at the

01:09:18,339 --> 01:09:23,219
beginning of the longer we have after

01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:32,309
Islam

01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:39,630
so basically in the lib directory of the

01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:41,460
test i shall i showed you do yours

01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:44,100
distribution all right if you want

01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:46,170
windowsill do we know there and then in

01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,960
lowly you just set the distribution and

01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:53,820
it will instigate this IP is basically

01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,220
all all over rid of overriding stuff you

01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:59,820
actually began with condo coming to the

01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:04,520
effects on it so this is required for

01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:04,520
some different os's than Adela relaxes

01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:17,630
and even there our sister distribution I

01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:27,990
don't even know what so all X we have

01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:32,010
here what if i sum one cycle okay this

01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:34,230
is another over a big school I don't

01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:36,450
know where I throw the installation and

01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:40,080
you're excited so it checks whether the

01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:43,200
packages installed you wanna know ok not

01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:47,010
so I think it here it only works in X

01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:49,710
Linux 1110 and so on such you can do

01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:53,660
have many places so to put some helpers

01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:58,410
of overrides answer the question

01:10:53,660 --> 01:11:04,880
if you now you have some presents i use

01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:13,200
st openoffice happy and you need to know

01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:16,860
when you open the help you identify the

01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:21,480
area for me to test and because you

01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:25,920
don't have screenshots for that this was

01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:28,830
I've only some side screen or check

01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:31,170
screen and until you don't have yet the

01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:34,020
safe screen doesn't check anything this

01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:37,230
a screen is to actually want you you

01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:39,570
will write the test as you know so

01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:44,490
that's it oh god gets to this situation

01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:46,350
and then I do you just wait for word for

01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:48,750
a few seconds and then saves list angel

01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:51,630
it will recite screenshot will then

01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:53,400
appear in the results and you just can't

01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:57,570
create a new needle from the screenshot

01:11:53,400 --> 01:12:00,390
ok so this I can do you have to know

01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:04,500
douchebag this is from the page all you

01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:06,570
can create your own screen you can do

01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:09,300
this by hand i could take a screenshot

01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:12,950
of the machine and rj sounds meta data

01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:15,540
and cooking put it there so pops it so

01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:18,300
it's easier to just put a safe

01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:24,060
screenshot call it will say it and I'll

01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:25,920
cover it to the too many good question

01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:28,200
and also you have prepared all these

01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,280
guys for for some distribution and

01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:38,220
everything

01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:40,920
how you test outside some high high

01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:43,230
contrast so we change the colors and

01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,870
also change your phone and we clear out

01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:49,110
everything or you need to only go to the

01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:51,540
website and check email us falling on it

01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:54,240
through the website town but that's

01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:59,370
usual and for the new branding the same

01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:01,940
the usual later of the work for it's the

01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,320
same you don't you don't need out any

01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:06,930
well come on Spock so you need to

01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:11,040
completely change this interest and then

01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:14,580
again oh you just may use the same time

01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:22,290
so will you convey to touch and I think

01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:25,050
it's called them and oh it's also if you

01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:26,250
can but usually because the little

01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:29,040
scared of a middle name is

01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:33,120
auto-generated you don't overwrite the

01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,660
world one so you can test the old

01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:44,150
version will be welcomed back we'll just

01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:44,150
work no no it was like

01:13:54,730 --> 01:14:01,930
for what you can

01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:08,330
yep this API I have for somewhere

01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:11,260
generated all the commands we have see

01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:11,260
if I come

01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:31,190
and this is generated from Riga POV to

01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:35,340
HTML this is all if I they're going in

01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:38,010
categories some fun what would the size

01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,139
screen shot as we are talking about soft

01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:43,530
failure from work around you can

01:14:40,139 --> 01:14:45,810
manually if you you either can use the

01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:48,330
work around the type from the flag on

01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:51,000
the screen shot itself or when you use

01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:54,270
walk around like in the co2 just this I

01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:58,260
don't know why this in the video Genesis

01:14:54,270 --> 01:15:01,110
explain what we can oh look at markets

01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:06,420
you know I see if you'd always have

01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:09,630
answered screen oh they're just so they

01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:12,510
can be ready or or the nail or just the

01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:14,400
needle and it will try to find one text

01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:21,090
clear is the same as a selfie but

01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:22,889
without so favorably failing oh the good

01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:25,860
thing about for example this one

01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:28,889
dimension static is that a bottom though

01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:33,239
the associate a screen they return the

01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:36,840
type of layers under the needle like

01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:39,330
object which matched so you don't need

01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,940
to save it it or the last night she's

01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:45,929
all there is always so we automatically

01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:49,500
say the last match object and you just

01:15:45,929 --> 01:15:54,060
can't know i'll check whether what stuck

01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:57,929
it was later and don't need to use some

01:15:54,060 --> 01:16:01,550
special variables oh this is how you can

01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:04,230
click without actually specifying God

01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:06,659
coordinates you can move mouse my

01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:12,500
coordinates also but this is go that it

01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:15,179
will find you it will find a needle and

01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:17,730
also the National yeah it will put it

01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:20,880
will calculate middle point of the fair

01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:24,090
paint area and click on it so when you

01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:27,350
want to just so click ok just this this

01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:27,350
one or double click

01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:36,740
this is for Laura for still a bit video

01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:41,510
and Link whether it's changing for

01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:44,390
matter is not changing oh this is for us

01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:48,200
access to variables so you can put which

01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:52,820
if Wes the the test won't fall or the

01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:55,730
chalkboard fall not so very interesting

01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:59,420
but intuitive and then serve your cereal

01:16:55,730 --> 01:17:03,110
so I hope ours just white sari are which

01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:07,190
just expected the chicks photo this air

01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:10,460
out of the machine and let's keep down a

01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:13,630
script and Santa hunters all the

01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:17,920
important thing is that when you is so

01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:21,800
as I said is Krypton gotta wait until 00

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:24,470
the program ends when you don't want it

01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,970
you for example that you need to check

01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,110
something for some sorry out with

01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:33,250
yourself we need to disable timeout or

01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:37,730
you saw type string it setup script on

01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:40,700
it that's a little to use it a little

01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:44,150
bit use to always so all this API watch

01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:46,670
at least we have now placed of them it

01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:53,180
wasn't a session case or like two weeks

01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:55,040
ago it was no communication well at

01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:58,190
first it was obsolete it a little

01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,490
because so nobody bothers ready to

01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:04,550
update the DoD's it was so another place

01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:07,310
because I actually spent a week working

01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:11,480
on collect another plantation to be in

01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:14,960
the right order and no updates all the

01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:18,950
all these strings and you really wanted

01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:21,860
to know which which just I PIV we offer

01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:25,030
you just need to go to the code and you

01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:30,050
an are some of our QA go you guys didn't

01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:33,210
no idea your son now this is the saying

01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:36,239
that many people don't also no less

01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:38,550
good so when you are new to some

01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:41,250
projects the first thing you do just

01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:45,450
copy and paste and existing tests and

01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:48,980
adaptive and let's react so sometimes

01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:54,090
beds that so-called style and tone so

01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:55,830
yeah I'll vice last week or two when I

01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:59,010
was preparing for all the presentations

01:18:55,830 --> 01:19:04,310
that's all I basically updating the

01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:06,570
documentation as well you know then

01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:09,560
you'll see we had something different

01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:13,170
for week I should have the machine

01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:16,530
without of course not all of them evolve

01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:21,230
so for all the kind sir this usually

01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:24,660
works only for chemo oh it may maybe

01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:26,550
also what I don't know it said all its

01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:28,080
depending if you go if you want to call

01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:33,710
it on the back end which that doesn't

01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:39,510
support it will crash the test do you

01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:45,270
have a bit like I go is currently being

01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:48,000
this so like this gradually we are

01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:51,090
stopped using it because 4pm oh it's

01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,670
actually look so there are how much

01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:55,950
sugar cpu which or CPU or utilize and

01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:58,770
where it is don't go off some class hold

01:19:55,950 --> 01:20:02,250
its side ok we are idle but on the other

01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:05,280
backgrounds it just sleep so it stops to

01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:07,590
show the test for there is a key 19

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:11,180
signals by default I don't know why I

01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:15,810
teen at our side what this in the code

01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:18,360
so we are that's why we are dropping

01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:24,600
this and use the waiting for the sale

01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:26,550
now this is the things to upload rocks

01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:30,600
and to get the Delta you have if you

01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:33,480
have something you know if you need

01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:36,140
something for a test uploading vlogs of

01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,140
holding assets

01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,690
keyboard support some key for individual

01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:49,920
keys there's nothing which you so for a

01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:55,260
little this is Alice's I so hate or

01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:57,630
helper when you for example need a list

01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:00,150
of menu for example a group and you want

01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:05,550
to select only the third important and

01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:08,490
don't you don't want to put so thats NT

01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:11,100
a four cycle and sometimes it can even

01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:14,040
change positions for apple and we have a

01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:16,350
rollback for Battier btrfs it's always

01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,900
different so we just never needed a

01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:21,930
screenshot or needle of the selected for

01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:26,850
a country with a selected protein a and

01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:29,490
we just said that so so it's a it's down

01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:31,530
until you make sure your needle and it

01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:33,630
will automatically iterates and try to

01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:39,890
push down and down and down at all

01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:39,890
absolutely so it's sometimes useful

01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:47,650
yes type string type of sport to say but

01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:55,990
passport is so then are hidden from the

01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:59,610
log so easy to small support you can

01:21:55,990 --> 01:22:03,190
move it oh we have come outside so

01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:07,900
offered so what is actually quite so

01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:11,590
important to use because when you have a

01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:16,570
clock scores or somewhere and you have

01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:18,070
it in your needle it many times so no it

01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:20,710
can happen it sometimes with multiple

01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:25,450
just hidden sometimes now and even the

01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:28,660
small first or kinda Oh made the needle

01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:31,990
tool to be finite so we use if I often

01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:34,420
it is it would only think it there does

01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:40,360
it just move this to some of offset dog

01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:47,200
out of the screen and just so it will

01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:49,960
not cluttered 00 bienvenidos yeah the

01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:53,230
motor control so this is a starfish

01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:58,120
pretty please oh it's again we look so

01:22:53,230 --> 01:23:00,960
only about you panel you can override it

01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:05,530
what the idea is that we don't need

01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:07,810
venue the distribution oh that's the

01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:10,240
distribution part cannot because this

01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:12,100
part is not available from this idea or

01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,620
this the Arkansas is not available from

01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:19,870
tested guide so don't from distribution

01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:22,060
oh that's mainly that the test the right

01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:25,450
of the test doesn't look myself with so

01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:28,480
we have the system population it's just

01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:35,170
obvious so testing system and basically

01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:37,090
you cannot you can add some hoops for it

01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:40,810
for it or when even we have root console

01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:45,910
it knows it is always so on TTI too so

01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:48,790
it always know when you call nan select

01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:51,159
phone select console and if consol read

01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:54,280
it will automatically push

01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:57,099
control alt f2 and during the accident

01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:01,059
or you are out in the console with

01:23:57,099 --> 01:24:03,249
automatically block to a lesser route so

01:24:01,059 --> 01:24:04,929
now you don't need to dislike become

01:24:03,249 --> 01:24:06,849
rule you will help first you just try

01:24:04,929 --> 01:24:09,249
needs a root console and it will switch

01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:12,809
to it in text mode I knew your people

01:24:09,249 --> 01:24:17,169
console and will switch to 50 there is

01:24:12,809 --> 01:24:20,590
37 I use a console so after she took out

01:24:17,169 --> 01:24:22,989
the four and so user is logged in so you

01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:24,669
don't need to like watch whether there

01:24:22,989 --> 01:24:30,130
is login prompt and do i need to locate

01:24:24,669 --> 01:24:32,729
it's already locked in and let's get out

01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:37,239
of support just this is the last one

01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:41,139
collected for like the audio yes you saw

01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:43,840
yesterday probably we can just so you

01:24:41,139 --> 01:24:47,289
can play audio in the back you are just

01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:49,360
too so how it sounds but on the every

01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:55,349
way itself it's just comparing the

01:24:49,360 --> 01:25:01,780
screenshots even for the audio you know

01:24:55,349 --> 01:25:03,699
so if you know wanted sit this is

01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:07,800
probably other errors in generated from

01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:07,800
the test API here

01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:16,510
and cold

01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:28,050
all right you know classical third and

01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:28,050
final data over each function is this

01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,360
box I don't know

01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,710
see the API

01:25:43,929 --> 01:25:49,289
yeah this probably what you want also

01:25:50,189 --> 01:25:56,880
the important thing is that by default

01:25:52,689 --> 01:26:00,699
when you don't settle the job is running

01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:04,719
and you don't set the results explicitly

01:26:00,699 --> 01:26:07,030
and it it will pass a little regard

01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:10,059
because it failed or it's alright though

01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:12,760
I think it will be state and unknown

01:26:10,059 --> 01:26:15,189
stay but it will reject the overall

01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:17,860
state would be like really paying so you

01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:23,679
need to explicitly said get the result

01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:27,489
is ok to be actually okay but you don't

01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:32,219
need to do it for sale and of course we

01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:38,320
use now that way so we just die right

01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:40,300
but it's early but in it s because now

01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,999
that you can have you can add a reason

01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:46,119
why I provided the way the test I it

01:26:42,999 --> 01:26:50,380
will show in the web UI it's ya know

01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:59,099
because of days to decide recording

01:26:50,380 --> 01:27:04,989
filers yes quality viral about it obert

01:26:59,099 --> 01:27:09,219
debugging cobra test I what

01:27:04,989 --> 01:27:13,150
else or logs and files a big rule which

01:27:09,219 --> 01:27:14,860
tests are produced so there is the

01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:16,840
independent if you are debugging the

01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:21,010
destitute itself over the divided

01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:23,709
parking SE te or no that's what's

01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:26,829
happened so for a debugging testers the

01:27:23,709 --> 01:27:30,429
importance of playing slow the output of

01:27:26,829 --> 01:27:33,820
the hottest engine where you see what so

01:27:30,429 --> 01:27:39,130
what needles was matching what was typed

01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:43,360
in tone and it's quite chatty so usually

01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:44,850
find what's wrong for debugging actual

01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,930
know

01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:52,590
with tested system we have these other

01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:55,740
variables and this will force to the

01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:58,460
optical finder the test days finish and

01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:02,490
all the tests are uploaded data uploaded

01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:06,240
the image is deleted and you specify the

01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:09,870
keep a GES variable oh it will prevent

01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:13,230
resolve it and you can then copy it

01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:15,480
outside it or whatever you want make

01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:18,240
snapshots so this basically overrides

01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:21,300
the milestone flag and we added to

01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:24,270
everything so after each successful text

01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:27,150
module it will create a snapshot then

01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:29,520
you can you skip to variable which will

01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:32,160
when you rate your start with your for

01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,700
example using a helper it will

01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:38,370
start the test for the last from the

01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:40,830
milestone we specify so let's say that

01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:44,820
can be your style for the beginning of

01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:47,460
the idea of the show that ICT or when

01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:50,220
you are developing the test so you don't

01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:52,800
need to again do the installations type

01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:57,900
and so on to just so concentrate on the

01:28:52,800 --> 01:29:00,270
10 on the one hour come on what you will

01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:06,450
not interested in there is one drawback

01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:09,900
though and that's where Napoles consoles

01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:12,480
when you are using the console test when

01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:17,520
you the the consoles are set up on

01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:20,310
during the first so like motivator than

01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:23,070
the test is started when you skip to it

01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:26,310
it so it keeps all the setup of the

01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:29,220
consoles so when you can then try to use

01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:33,690
select solid console and you skipped

01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:35,820
over your initial page face so it will

01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:39,000
not be tolerated that either don't know

01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:43,260
we console or you will know where you'll

01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:47,400
obtain and some so how one you need to

01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:50,400
beat needs to be careful also skip over

01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,650
the initialization usually it's good for

01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,489
when you are testing the

01:29:51,650 --> 01:30:02,060
it's stopping the poster it's usually in

01:29:55,489 --> 01:30:08,239
the correct so both sides yeah this is

01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:13,130
the door almost at the end fearon with

01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:16,370
time for dependencies start after test

01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:19,640
you set it as a oh so you better do it

01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:22,330
so variable then you push the status

01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:25,580
line a little clearer in the change or

01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:27,560
dependency which means that one test

01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:31,010
will be run at the first and the second

01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,600
item will be started boob shadowed only

01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:36,890
after the first one is faxes

01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:40,460
successfully finish oh what all that is

01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:44,900
this it's the shadow issue that's all of

01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:49,010
these jobs will be here together and I

01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:50,659
think to remember is that schedule error

01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:54,469
checks the state of the mass of the

01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:56,510
parent stars or a bottom job and you

01:30:54,469 --> 01:30:59,030
need to write the test in that way it

01:30:56,510 --> 01:31:02,120
will wait until other sooner we'll

01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:04,760
finish because when the parent job stops

01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:07,489
or finishes either successfully or not

01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:10,010
the shirt and the job the children jobs

01:31:07,489 --> 01:31:20,050
are running the shadow is for the

01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:24,590
children drops yes yeah kilo so we have

01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:28,429
except for ya yes I was showing the best

01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:31,780
idea we also have nmit I which is for

01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:31,780
exactly for multi machines

01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,400
No

01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:05,919
and here we have you see this is what we

01:32:02,889 --> 01:32:10,599
got so the iti exports so you're going

01:32:05,919 --> 01:32:12,429
to ask all the stays out there are no in

01:32:10,599 --> 01:32:14,380
what state are each other from the

01:32:12,429 --> 01:32:18,159
shoulder you can out from childhood get

01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:20,199
asked about parent and you will won't

01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:23,409
have to call wait for children it will

01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:25,749
justice waits and so what you need

01:32:23,409 --> 01:32:29,739
somebody needs whether at the orange for

01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:36,909
current job needs to be running again

01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:40,989
and for that we also get City it uses

01:32:36,909 --> 01:32:45,579
the Glocks and lock signet in the lock

01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:48,899
API and it created to have a maximum or

01:32:45,579 --> 01:32:55,599
text create contacts local takes a lot

01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:58,599
it sucks so only for texts are named so

01:32:55,599 --> 01:33:01,209
you just pass a name of the organ text

01:32:58,599 --> 01:33:04,630
to create and and you cannot ask for for

01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:08,919
it and the important thing is that they

01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:10,689
are all these are always related to the

01:33:08,919 --> 01:33:14,110
job to the job groups they are they have

01:33:10,689 --> 01:33:18,329
an Incan so when you pull up around for

01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:21,610
you say was the same name names

01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:27,820
indifference this is a test they don't

01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:34,079
interfere so you can safely use or

01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:34,079
whatever name and I use it it's actually

01:33:35,929 --> 01:33:48,929
yeah it's still we still can be updated

01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:53,969
but so far for out test this is so

01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:58,410
what's so put enough for us drop a set

01:33:53,969 --> 01:34:01,710
oh that's as I said difference between

01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:05,850
locks and offset is that assets can be

01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:08,580
asses our store that can be removed in

01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:12,440
different tests there is the difference

01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:15,120
between the store HDD publish a GD and

01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:18,420
you have store asset and pasta to

01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:20,370
publish yeah there's a topical up

01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:25,020
opposite and you can specify whether you

01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:27,810
want to be private or public and the

01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:33,050
difference is that the private assets

01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:41,010
are the job ID is prepared declined over

01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:44,160
graphics for asset so idea is that no

01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:49,320
asset is already used in the job and

01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:51,300
it's not rehost outside of south so to

01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,640
guarantee that you don't overwrite it in

01:34:51,300 --> 01:35:01,910
tomorrow with that you if you use the

01:34:53,640 --> 01:35:01,910
public it will pass today or the order

01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,850
of the asset and each test value around

01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:13,949
it and use the same way football

01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:17,910
overreacted if you need to go through

01:35:13,949 --> 01:35:21,179
the alero these variables are the store

01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:23,850
HD iotv HD use it use it as a test for

01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:28,949
rebels and it will trigger the upload of

01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:31,410
the image the machine which click finish

01:35:28,949 --> 01:35:34,230
and then you of course you at the FBI

01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:38,219
for a broader set for a new device these

01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:41,250
variables are for order images so let's

01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:43,980
a nice idea organized for example when

01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,420
you know just something can publish it

01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:47,460
you

01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:50,100
somebody else from one different work

01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:53,600
and download it I think we use it in

01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:56,219
Imogen control flow to it when you

01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:59,790
install or two it's only to some

01:35:56,219 --> 01:36:04,020
straight publish the public asset the

01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:06,570
edgy asset and then Jenkins is called on

01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:10,110
this on this easel or is all this for

01:36:06,570 --> 01:36:15,330
eyes or great image so we do its tests

01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:19,489
and so you can actually apply to open to

01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:24,900
end up nicely in the IPL description

01:36:19,489 --> 01:36:34,530
yeah that's that's all for my side

01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:38,010
editing yeah 3 grams Santos oh there are

01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:43,500
no packages fault I well they were there

01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:46,230
men managed to pick it for fedora so I'm

01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:49,199
always different but it's not like those

01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:53,870
whose a specific time you can not be

01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:53,870
purchased for airport I small reason why

01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:05,620
yeah there is a docker image for the

01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:10,989
seconds oh you don't have no we were

01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:14,110
already yelled at some I don't already

01:37:10,989 --> 01:37:23,020
out it's also about poet or someone I

01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:29,590
think oh the one we actually do

01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:31,360
sometimes some nasty stuff in peril so

01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:39,520
far and so far no one no one was

01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:47,380
confining some and yeah but it's all in

01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:50,790
a bit for those surveys open open the

01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:54,940
surveys we all kind of liability only 44

01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:57,880
Susur distributions but we can you wanna

01:37:54,940 --> 01:38:03,219
go in there is interest or I think some

01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:06,850
type of user to but so far we were a lot

01:38:03,219 --> 01:38:09,810
i postponed this and federal guys just

01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:09,810
do it later

01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:19,970
any more question and on this

01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:24,770
recommendation on line Nia where's your

01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:27,860
petition is to this IP are yeah it's so

01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:31,190
close you can write in your phone well

01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:33,610
but the plan is I didn't they don't have

01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:37,010
time for to finish it but plan is that

01:38:33,610 --> 01:38:38,360
this is this this repetition blow

01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:40,330
automatically generated and then

01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:44,450
published in open QA where crystal

01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:47,330
because this is the best engine where

01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:50,720
this test API is if this one is always

01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:54,410
sometimes but all the documentation

01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:58,220
about how to write the exam two or more

01:38:54,410 --> 01:39:02,750
periods is open way so eventually in the

01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:05,510
upcoming days or equal to I expect to

01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:08,920
have some automatic upload a protein

01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:12,140
from authorized to evacuate and then

01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:17,240
