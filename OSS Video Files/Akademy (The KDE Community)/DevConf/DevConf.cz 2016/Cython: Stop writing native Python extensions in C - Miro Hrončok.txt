Title: Cython: Stop writing native Python extensions in C - Miro Hronƒçok
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Cython [1] let's you write native Python extensions in a syntax very similar to Python itself. It compiles your code to C and gives you the performance of C (or C++) while keeping the coding itself easy and Pythonistic. You can use Cython to write performance focused parts of your Python project or to create nice Python interfaces for C or C++ libraries, without the need of going mad using the Python C API.

This workshop is interned for programmers already familiar with the Python language, who have no or very small knowledge of Cython.

Live demos are part of the session - the entire session is mostly demos.
