okay hi my name is Michael Thurmond I'm

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,820
currently employed by a company named

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,650
imagination technologies you might know

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,510
me I've been working at rosette for

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:33,719
quite a while before and now I have been

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:37,190
contracted to work on yes so I have been

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,379
contracted to work on fedora form it's

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:44,640
what I will be talking about is firstly

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,219
MIPS architecture in general then MIPS

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,360
and what it means for fedora where are

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:55,530
we then some hardware that you can or

00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:01,680
cannot use and buy and hopefully a live

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:03,899
demo so MIPS in general MIPS has been

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,350
around for quite a while been introduced

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:13,320
in 1981 as a university project for

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:16,110
racist abuse the MIPS company was

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,540
founded by the professor who led the

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,520
whole at the university research team in

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:31,530
1984 SGI tomato bought the company in

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:34,439
1992 and entered and imagination

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,130
technologies I mean there hasn't been a

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:42,060
lot of work around MIPS or in the last

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,270
decades let's say and imagination

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:53,399
technologies just post about the company

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:56,490
in 2013 so for the actual CPUs there are

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,670
loads of loads of loads of instructions

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,200
as different instruction sets we can

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,369
basically divide them into two groups

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:11,849
first our legacy which ended in 1998 and

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:14,629
then modern ones the legacy MIPS 1 2

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,629
MIPS 5

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,210
some routers and some boards are still

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,540
using them but I don't think that's

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,900
really relevant anymore or for something

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,280
like future development so so let's talk

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:37,140
about the modern ones they called them

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,200
mips32 and mips64 obviously MIPS that 2

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,320
n64 are specified in revisions one two

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,360
three and five wikipedia says forward

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,970
skip because it brings bad luck in Asia

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:56,490
I don't know whether this Drona but and

00:02:49,970 --> 00:03:00,360
and there's a new specification really

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:02,340
64 both 32 and 64-bit which was which

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,350
was designed by imagination technologies

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:10,440
and which has some compatibility issues

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,440
it's not really all called fully

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,930
backwards compatible because the the

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,310
rest is fully backwards comparable the

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:24,540
really six solves some historical issues

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:30,120
that mix has to this day but it because

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:33,120
of the compatibility so ND anything max

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,040
can do both you choose basically it

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,070
depends on it depends on what the cpu is

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,160
designed to do but in general you can

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,750
just make the Indian theater aside and

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,450
go with whatever unlike other

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,680
architectures may test three major a be

00:03:51,450 --> 00:04:03,660
ice it has the 0 32 which is the old 32

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:06,930
bits ABI it has 32-bit data registers

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,980
and pointers and it has some extensions

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,820
like for floating point registers I'll

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,000
be talking about that then there is n 64

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,150
which is like 40 60 board for bait ABI

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,800
and then there is n 32 which is kind of

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,780
hybrid it's

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,849
it has the stupid pointer and 64-bit

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,250
data is the opposite of what Intel does

00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:37,159
because Intel wanted just to have more

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:40,250
memory on 32-bit data and mips want it

00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:45,229
to have 64-bit data like for example you

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:47,569
want 64 bits time or 64-bit counters and

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,370
in the network appliances but you still

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:53,470
want to keep your binaries as small as

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:56,330
possible so so that's the motivation and

00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:00,199
44 the variance of the oath of the two

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:04,580
ABI the first two are quite

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,330
straightforward like the floating point

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,590
registers are either 32 or 64 bits

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:15,409
dieppe is 64 a kind of interesting I it

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,759
took me a while to get how it works but

00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:24,129
it actually tells your system you have

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:30,380
64 bits wide registers but underneath

00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:32,900
the the implementation in hardware is

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,259
that you actually use two 32-bit

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:39,529
registers the I don't know whether it

00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:41,539
colonel does its or probably G lipstick

00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:44,090
let's place it and set it into two

00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:46,909
registers and actually if you have an

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:51,349
embedded assembly or whatever you only

00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:54,680
can use the the even register addresses

00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:59,750
and if you use the the advanced it will

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:04,120
fail compiling so yeah and then there's

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:07,430
the FP XX which tries to be somehow

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:12,229
compatible with everything it assumes

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:15,110
nothing and really either either uses

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:19,340
what's available or or goes with

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,770
whatever code is linked to it like the

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,870
yes big six code is kind of neutral and

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,000
if you link it with that two-bit it

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,300
starts assuming such to be refilling it

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,110
with 64-bit start assuming 64-bit from

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,870
the moment today maps where maps is used

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,080
networking of course

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:45,860
switches routers embedded on network

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,860
card internet backbone telephony

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:57,780
microcontrollers yeah in car industry in

00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,870
like different driver 8 wearables there

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:07,560
I've even seen a tablet and of course

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:12,150
video game consoles and and I was told

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:16,620
mixes also MIPS is also starting to play

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,330
in high performance computing and what

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,330
usually runs on maps these days it's

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,630
linux android has been ported in twenty

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:30,000
twelve or twenty thirteen i believe all

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:33,300
the bsd variants and of course i was

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,430
surprised actually that the embedded

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:40,170
windows i knew about that but Windows NT

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:46,430
up to the 4.0 has also random lips like

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:46,430
own every other architecture yeah

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,750
yes

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:18,760
yes yes risk so nipson fedora there has

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:25,390
been a booster attempt between fedora 11

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:30,190
and 13 and they called the architecture

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:34,780
mips64 l it was using the hybrid and 32

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:38,229
ABI little-endian obviously but there

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,990
was little interest and in fedora 13 it

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,539
just died I mean you can still you can

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,260
still get the packages from from the

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:52,980
original author but but it's you know

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:56,920
it's a part of subset of the Rafferty so

00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:02,590
then we started our fedora 20 to

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:07,660
bootstrap in last year March we chose to

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:11,950
architectures mips64 L which is now

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:15,700
fully 64-bit and with Lebanon obviously

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:19,330
and mipsel which is the 32-bit ABI with

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:23,080
the FP xyx with the most comparable

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:27,360
variant of all the ABI and at this

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,820
moment we are in stage 4 we are

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,340
preparing to deploy kochi kochi hardware

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,670
has been due to arrive in october then

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,700
november december and actually last week

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,100
i got the photo of the actual machines

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,040
standing in the Reich so I believe we

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:56,140
finally have that and and we can deploy

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:57,460
code you now yes I'll get that yeah you

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,910
might see I've sent an email that's

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:06,900
Fedora 23 or reasonable subset of

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:11,810
further 23 has been sort of released on

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:15,070
last week basically or this week you

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:19,490
there are some images for creme you and

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:27,260
images for CI 20 board I'm going to get

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:30,740
to that so status for a 32-bit maps you

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:34,580
can see like almost 7,000 out of some

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:40,130
8,000 I think it's 8008 packages source

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:44,480
packages and filler 23 exercise and

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:48,380
Alexi desktops work there are some

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:52,310
issues with building Java like some real

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:55,160
issues that we need to address adonys

00:10:52,310 --> 00:11:01,730
bootstrap ball grains only has support

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:06,410
for the 32 fully 32-bit ABI it has no no

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:09,410
support for a 64-bit extensions and one

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,230
thing is that the desk life like that

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:17,540
the door I use is for hardening is kind

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:21,770
of broken ellipse and broil breaks every

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:26,270
every package that uses hardening on a

00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:29,960
64 bits there's there's a little last

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:34,700
packages Bell just because the build far

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:38,210
for 32-bit is a little larger desktops

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:43,100
also work via VNC I am not aware of any

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:45,170
mid 64 machine with video output yeah

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,310
java bills but eclipsed need

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:51,230
bootstrapping and i'll obviously and it

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,050
has some some interesting issues with

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:58,310
the lungs own cars which are made in

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:00,880
china some links and engineers try to

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,230
contact us sometimes they race

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,990
compatibility issues like they have some

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:12,050
instructions that that our rounding

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,529
values in a different way than the other

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,110
course and they need to they always ask

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,360
us to disable some limitations or well

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,900
basically almost all the optimizations

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,610
to i mean big fully comparable but when

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,329
you ask them i mean what's the root

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:31,790
cause you get no answer or you just get

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,170
asked my manager and that's the end of

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,880
the conversation or something like that

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:42,339
so needs more communication definitely

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,959
okay issues we've got quite a while

00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:51,200
obviously packaging parks some packages

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:56,950
walk upstream support there's no okay mo

00:12:51,200 --> 00:13:02,329
for maps and then yeah different

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,820
different JavaScript Jade's are or are

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:08,089
not working or even if they have made

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:13,040
sport it's for some ancient instruction

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:16,839
set and nobody really works on that

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,640
anymore so it an interesting thing that

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,060
the Guru built IDs are in support

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:29,839
elements if you try with build ID style

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:32,360
called GNU GCC files obviously boost

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:38,449
required I was talking java eclipse

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:40,579
other interesting thing 32-bit maps only

00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:44,750
has three gigabytes of virtual space in

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:46,640
a kernel you cannot add more don't ask

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,490
me why it has something to do with map

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:55,399
and on memory but that's that's as far

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:58,240
as i understand it yeah the dash I'm 32

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,060
and 64 flags are not recognized by GCC

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:06,970
which some some fedora packages as

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,970
explicitly by by the mode yeah

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:19,870
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahs or unit today

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:24,340
at like if our car i'm 64 in mid 64 l

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:29,560
I've seen that it saved me quite a lot

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:31,690
of work yeah another interesting thing

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:37,240
that you name only tells you mix or

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:40,660
mips64 you don't get the indiana t you

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,530
don't even get the the instruction set

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,900
or I mean mips64 really six isn't binary

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:50,920
compatible with the previous the

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:53,680
previous binaries but it tells me 64

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,550
anyways so so that's not a good not a

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,510
good way to distinguish or architecture

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,520
and a most packages actually use auto

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,130
tools r sigmaj and the hand was properly

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,630
but there are some packages that that

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:14,560
just check your name and go for it so

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:16,990
yeah the shell atomic needs to be

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,460
specified excessive on 32-bit mix I have

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:26,170
no idea why but it just need Java that's

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:31,120
a really interesting story I've been

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:34,089
trying to it with with the 0 with the 0

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,770
like Enterprise mouth it builds fine on

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:44,380
64 bits on 32-bit it dies on illegal

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:46,690
instruction I've asked several guys why

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,940
this could be i mean our internal tools

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,490
guys java guys colonel guys and nobody

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,600
is able to tell me when we disassemble

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,850
the code for found the instructions just

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,660
put it into a text file compile a load

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:04,060
run it was working so only in a context

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:09,970
of java for some reason the instructions

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:12,580
are illegal we we've been on that for

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:17,010
quite a while and I mean nobody is able

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:20,110
to tell what what could be the issue

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,170
yeah then there's a inside llewyn belt

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,220
time

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:27,260
I mean it's obviously not the most

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,760
powerful architecture in the world but

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:35,180
my most favorite package for last half a

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,230
year is limited which is a library that

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:42,529
computes integrals which it actually

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,630
takes to some seven or eight hours to

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:57,680
build on primary or such a tube admits

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:59,540
it took 21 days now but I actually think

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,899
there's something like concept really

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:07,220
wrong I mean it 21 is really too long

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:11,209
for stain bill I mean I understand c++

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:15,559
and C++ is slow but there's fairly

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,329
something that could be done yeah and to

00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,319
the fullest is on fedora wiki if you

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:26,270
just go to wiki further a project or

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:31,210
architecture maps you can find it future

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:33,350
plans short-term deploy the Koji finally

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,679
of course and finish the bootstrap

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,740
midterm fix or exclude our call the

00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,470
packages I mean bring this to a state

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,890
where its secondary architecture like

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:48,110
every other for sure we will be

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:53,950
bootstrapping the r6 architecture it's

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:56,809
been added to cry move in summer and and

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,419
from long-term imagination wants to be

00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,210
including residence price Linux but

00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:08,840
there's there's still a long way to go

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:11,929
for that so hardware current status of

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,320
hardware very little standardization I

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,840
mean very little every every every chip

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,840
manufacturer bail system I mean it's

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,530
very similar to our you know arm like

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,960
unifies over time or at least a bit this

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,610
is in the state to state where arm was I

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,640
would say five years ago when we started

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,090
sir and it's even the same status in the

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,210
colonel

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,890
you cannot build a generic arm kernel

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,350
and module for chips that you need to

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:49,310
pick the one board you are building for

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:53,510
at the beginning and and this well with

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:55,910
our fedora the flavored kernels and it

00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:01,190
was the pain in the ass but that's what

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:04,730
makes us but that's the steps nipson

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:08,210
mixes in at this moment so a lack of

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,830
support an upstream colonel no I would

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,970
say current Hardware runs on upstream

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:18,620
cure some some boards are very close to

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:21,500
that some are very far from that but but

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:25,460
with Epsom Colonel there's there's very

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,400
little support of course there's a lack

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,010
of hackable hardware because mostly MIPS

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,180
is used in embedded boards like it's

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:38,960
embedded on your on 10 gigabit nic or

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:42,110
it's some coprocessor for for whatever

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,680
but you cannot really like run your

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:56,540
operating system on on the actual Mapes

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:58,460
CPU yeah yeah you can do that yeah the

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,930
issue with that is that routers usually

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,970
don't have more than 256 memory 256

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,460
Meg's of memory because for some reason

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:12,530
I was told its historical reason I don't

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,880
stage that maps only has support for 256

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,430
miles memory and if you want more you

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:21,200
need to enable high mine which decreases

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:23,030
performance yeah and there are you can

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,100
buy out to bars but they are usually

00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,930
begin the end at this moment we are not

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,930
building beginning in fedora we might

00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,460
edit in the future the issue is really i

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,910
would say lack of build hardware because

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,830
we just got our little indian kochi so

00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,850
but there's there's there's no like

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,420
conceptual problem with doing that

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,990
really it's just the resources and yeah

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,710
usually the the memory I don't know if

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,370
anybody will

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:54,529
try to use fedora with 256 megabytes of

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,640
memory but you cannot reduce the NF if

00:20:54,529 --> 00:21:02,809
you have that may be atomic could be

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:08,809
solution for that I mean because I don't

00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:12,590
know time will show so one board you can

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:15,919
buy for sure is the creator CI 20 it's

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:20,090
it's been designed for by imagination

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,840
technologies just as just to have some

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:28,309
development board it has a dual core cpu

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,860
gig of ram 8 gig nant whatever SD card

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,440
slot it's basically similar to all the

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:38,149
arm development boards that came out

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:42,169
over last five years it is a although a

00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:46,750
a pin out compatible with raspberry PI's

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:49,100
and you can get it you can get it for

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:59,570
fifty pounds fifty British pounds i

00:21:49,100 --> 00:22:04,279
think it's $65 in the US yeah i'm

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:09,380
getting played the CI 40 is a it's a 32

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:11,210
bit bored it's 32 bit little endian the

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:16,520
board imagination is planning next is

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:18,020
DCI 40 it's designed to be for the

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,799
Internet of Things it's not really a

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:26,360
development board it has a it has the

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:28,730
low power consumption CPU double court

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,080
alter it so you should actually see for

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:36,049
threats in your eyes again it only has a

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:41,149
quarter gig of memory it has a small

00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:46,370
flash and it has some dedicated chip for

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:51,140
for the 60 pad stack used with the

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:54,590
Internet of Things and imagination we

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,600
will actually ship it as a kid and they

00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,580
have some some Sun supports already

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,110
designed for it

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:06,590
I think there's a like a box and three

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,779
sensors by default you can buy more they

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:12,200
have ranged funds on Kickstarter the

00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:14,720
board i believe is either being in

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,610
production or design is finished and

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,610
will go to production but it's coming

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,610
they raised enough funds on kickstarter

00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:42,200
what now yeah and then we have the the

00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:43,970
64-bit the s DNA it's I think some

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,360
dedicated network apply software they

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,360
get a network appliance it's mips64 to

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,740
cabin built these parts they come in

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,990
several configurations from 448 CPUs

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,799
from for the first piece of memory they

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:03,950
have SAT a slot for system you can order

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,559
them from Reno laps it's an American

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,019
manufacture and if you want to have it

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:14,240
shipped into Europe you need to pay

00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:16,309
taxes unfortunately that's the issue

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,080
they don't mention price last time I

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:22,190
checked they've only sold two companies

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,799
they only had one one product when I

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:28,730
checked like well when creating this

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:31,429
presentation now there are actually I

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:35,510
think five or six configurations

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:42,440
available from presumably cheapest to to

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:44,690
the most expensive we only have I mean

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,840
in the match mission we have T as DNA 7

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,730
130 whatever it was the only one board

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,260
it was available was codenamed UTM it

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:57,710
and it was about thousand dollars it's a

00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:03,649
quad core quad core MIPS I think with it

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:05,809
gives memory yeah and these machines are

00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:09,110
actually the machines that will become

00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:11,140
Koji if it's a photo from the data

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,150
center

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,270
yeah so I mean you need to you need to

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:35,870
ask you know they have form like half

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:37,580
calf which we want to order yeah I never

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:41,690
saw the situation with harbors good I

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:50,450
mean I would love to tell you I mean by

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:52,669
this Boris it is yes when I was planning

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,820
the presentation like half a year ago or

00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:58,970
a year oh how fear ago our way it wasn't

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,580
in the shape is now and I was like I

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,790
might we'll be able to compare it to our

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,880
v8 but at this moment I mean really its

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:10,250
course but there are there are other

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:14,090
boards blend I mean imagine a shin just

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:19,520
bought the deed maps or three years ago

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:23,770
and they basically started thinking

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,510
about new boards and they really do plan

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:30,790
some next door so hopefully fingers

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,790
crossed we will we will get some more

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:55,790
yeah I see ya and it will be used by 12

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,429
votes right once more internet of things

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:02,929
but most of people will go for

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:05,480
anyway the other one is for this one

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:09,159
King about memory board where most

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:17,809
people will go for arm right or you have

00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:20,990
64 feet from one server um yep you're

00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:42,350
right i mean i I can't tell you anything

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:47,720
else yes once you get fedora you can use

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:51,320
it to boot centers yeah and ten toes you

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:56,649
can build on your own you can play with

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,649
those guys good give it included etc

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:13,820
basically very ish market okay yeah okay

00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:20,090
you can of course you scream you it

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:22,549
works there are a lot of CPUs mmm both

00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,889
64 bits and searched available beginning

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,350
little endian are some issues like you

00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:29,929
cannot get SMP for whatever reason and

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:35,809
you can only specify two gigs of memory

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:40,480
Crimea doesn't let you specify more live

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:40,480
demo ok the moment of public humiliation

00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:47,539
okay hopefully not today because the

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,720
presentation is being run from the 20

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:49,720
board

00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:04,700
um can see I have a bluetooth mouse and

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:07,730
keyboard oh yeah the unfortunately the

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:13,190
GPU drivers proprietary so you have to

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:17,450
use you have to frame buffer but mostly

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:20,510
works I know I've got bluetooth by

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:24,490
referrals I can connect to the Wi-Fi

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,490
hopefully even though it's unusable here

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,669
yeah that's about it so that's my life

00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:36,010
demo if you want to see anything if you

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:36,010
want to see anything just ask I can try

00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:10,720
yeah so imagination both lips as a

00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:13,960
company in general with all their

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,480
employees they are in process of somehow

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,450
merging the workflows they want to do

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,899
that but I mean it's still working

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:26,080
progress they they want to do this they

00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:46,330
want to work upstream but hopefully

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:51,519
we'll get there no it's all mine your

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:54,490
work I mean when you when you get to the

00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:57,669
point where you have Koji you can

00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:03,130
actually do some automation but before

00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:07,149
that yes and I saw a project that would

00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:11,039
like actually try to ease up this

00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:13,600
process I don't know what status is in

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,779
yeah I know the band has a shell script

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,429
where you like basically booster debian

00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:23,740
architecture and on the other end you

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:26,610
get any iphone but no yeah no Fedora has

00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,610
nothing like that

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:44,970
yeah so the GPU is is the perp our VR

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,860
chip which is actually the primary

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:51,960
business area of imagination so it's

00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:56,250
their own and but they they are

00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,370
discussing building our providing some

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,010
like limited open-source drivers to the

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,200
colonel so that it works at least

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:08,880
somehow basically something like Google

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:15,590
or or it's not that there but the

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,590
discussions are ongoing anything else

00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:34,740
no I mean there's no the short answer is

00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:37,710
no I mean I am not aware of any there

00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,659
might be in future I I'm not saying you

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:50,539
fi will not be available but at this

00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:50,539
moment I am not aware of that human d

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:08,000
yes well there is the original lips

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:12,720
bootloader it's cold I don't know CFE

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,600
yeah I don't remember exactly and but

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,140
basically all the current birds work

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,140
with you would

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:40,010
I mean that's here 20 bart has it has a

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:43,400
newer one and I'm not sure how much they

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:46,610
push power or what part of it put i push

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,770
the upstream with nothing okay because

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,480
I'd oh I know I know in a colonel there

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,820
are bits I mean you can build up stream

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,230
kernel with CI 20 defconfig but it

00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,390
actually doesn't work because you don't

00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:04,010
have any storage subsystem to put your

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:15,590
root of a song but but well yeah I got

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:19,460
oh what oh I didn't try that I'll just

00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:30,409
checked last time that MMC USB and the

00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:33,020
9th didn't work at all so I gave up and

00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:36,220
I mean the patches are you can grab the

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,330
patch if they have a 318 curl on it and

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:43,510
I have good Reaper you can grab the

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,510
patches there's lots of them early and

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:52,810
you need them I mean USB chipset support

00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,810
for for the for the XO

00:34:53,510 --> 00:35:01,230
okay um okay so yeah i'm not i'm really

00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,180
not a colonel guy i really just like

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:07,590
working on the packaging stuff and

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:10,770
booster think so but definitely make

00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:26,750
your point i will i will raise it to

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:26,750
people who work on that yeah yeah

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,810
good question no idea I mean the bar is

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,860
if you go to Reno website they have

00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:44,760
pre-configured it's like the most

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:46,170
powerful board is 48 cars and 64 because

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,360
of memory and that's basically what's

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,160
written there and in case you want to

00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,190

motion a shin guards imaginations of the

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,400
still it's a connection participating as
