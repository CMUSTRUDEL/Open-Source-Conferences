Title: Containerizing the distribution - Colin Walters
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	This talk will focus on a roadmap for longer-term (1-2 years) changes to make to drive container awareness deeper into the traditional package distribution model. For example:

- Support for non-root containers using RPMs
- The role of systemd on the host and inside containers, particularly "microservices" vs systemd-in-container
- The role of SELinux policy
- How to maintain the advantages of packaging, such as system/cluster wide updates
