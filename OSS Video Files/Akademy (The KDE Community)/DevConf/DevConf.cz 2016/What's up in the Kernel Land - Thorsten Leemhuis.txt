Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	This presentation gives an overview of recent and current developments in the Linux kernel; it will discuss what major changes the recent kernel versions brought, what the next kernel version will bring and what the kernel developers are working on for future releases. In that scope the presentation sometimes will also discuss changes in software close to the kernel; that for example includes Mesa, as its OpenGL hardware drivers work closely with the graphics drivers in the Linux kernel.
