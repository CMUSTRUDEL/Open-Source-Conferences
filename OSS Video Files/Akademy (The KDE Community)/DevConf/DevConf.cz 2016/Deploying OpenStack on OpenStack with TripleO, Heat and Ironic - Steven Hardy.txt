Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	In this session you will learn about the latest developments in the OpenStack deployment project, TripleO, which uses OpenStack services including Heat (orchestration) and Ironic (baremetal provisioning) to deploy your production OpenStack Cloud.

The session will cover an introduction to the OpenStack components involved, the main components of TripleO, and a deep-dive into the TripleO Heat Templates, explaining how to modify them to suit your enviroment, and a demonstration of TripleO deploying OpenStack, on OpenStack!

Some prior knowledge of Heat, and of OpenStack services will be beneficial for the deep-dive part of this talk, but no prior knowledge of TripleO or OpenStack deployment is required.
