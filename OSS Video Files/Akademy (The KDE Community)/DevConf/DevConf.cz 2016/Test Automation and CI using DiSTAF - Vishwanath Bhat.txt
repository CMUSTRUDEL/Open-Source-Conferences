Title: Test Automation and CI using DiSTAF - Vishwanath Bhat
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	DiSTAF stands for Distributed Systems Test Automation Framework. It provides powerful APIs which enables the user to automate the tests fast and efficiently. It is very modular and written with simplicity in mind. Although it is written to solve the automation problems of glusterfs, it can be used to automate many distributed systems. More information is available at https://github.com/gluster/distaf. 

In the presentation I will cover the advantages it has over the other test automation frameworks and about architecture and APIs. I will also cover how the upstream CI has been structured using the distaf and containers.

I will be giving a live demo if the time permits.
