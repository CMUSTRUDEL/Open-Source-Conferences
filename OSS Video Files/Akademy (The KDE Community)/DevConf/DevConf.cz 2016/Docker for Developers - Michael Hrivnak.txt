Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Docker is not just for deployment. As a developer, there are many ways Docker can make you more productive, regardless of how your app gets deployed.

In this session, you will learn practical strategies for using Docker, including how to:

- Run unit tests locally in multiple environments with almost no overhead.
- Make your integration tests easy for anyone to run by distributing them in a Docker image.
- Simulate advanced network topologies, especially for a service-oriented architecture.
- Make a Docker image in 5 minutes or less that produces builds from a consistent environment.
- Isolate database state changes in your test suite by using a pool of disposable containers.
