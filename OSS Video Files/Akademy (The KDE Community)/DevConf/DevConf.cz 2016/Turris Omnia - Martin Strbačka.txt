Description: 
	In 2013 we started a research project regarding SOHO networks security called Project Turris. As a part of the project we developed our first open-source SOHO router. Turris Omnia is a spin-off project from the original project Turris and it aims to bring to the market afordable, powerful and secure SOHO router which is completely open-source and open-hardware. This talk will cover few topics such as motivation for starting this project and developing of our own hardware and software.
