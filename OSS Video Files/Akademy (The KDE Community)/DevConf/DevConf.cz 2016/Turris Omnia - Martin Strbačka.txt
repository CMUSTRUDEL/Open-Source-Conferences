Title: Turris Omnia - Martin Strbačka
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	In 2013 we started a research project regarding SOHO networks security called Project Turris. As a part of the project we developed our first open-source SOHO router. Turris Omnia is a spin-off project from the original project Turris and it aims to bring to the market afordable, powerful and secure SOHO router which is completely open-source and open-hardware. This talk will cover few topics such as motivation for starting this project and developing of our own hardware and software.

Oh

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,680
today and stood past comes with a set of

00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,370
four months personality to the edge

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,370
Konoha range

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,070
I mean

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,890
yep booster feel really good yeah

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:47,140
you have to predict emotion he wants

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,140
custom go i got super-dizzy spa

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,220
01 succotash

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,440
hello everyone please welcome Martin

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,440
sterba chica

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:07,090
thank you my name is once again that's

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,730
better yeah so again my name is Martin

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,750
Sobotka I work for seasoning and more

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:15,610
concretely for our own projector ease if

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,300
you haven't heard about dates I will I

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,450
will try to tell you something from the

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,340
three years long history of the project

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:30,970
and hopefully you'll be it will have a

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,880
nice overview so at first few words

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,669
about seas at Nick we are the operator

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,270
of Czech TLD domain we are

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:43,150
not-for-profit organization and because

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:46,750
of that we are trying to do projects for

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,950
the good of the internet just for

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:54,340
example one of our biggest projects and

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:58,360
oldest birth route in the moon or not

00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,419
dns server and many more maybe you heard

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:06,419
about it viren we also run the Czech

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:09,760
national CCS team and everything we do

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:14,289
it's open source we strongly believe in

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:19,539
it and we are happy to well share our

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:21,970
work with anybody who wants you so what

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:25,539
is project tourists it's a security

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:30,430
research project at first it's a service

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:33,580
for helping to protect home networks we

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,310
created a tourist which is basically a

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,890
router but it works as a probe as a

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:43,510
network probe in the same time we

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,020
developed it and we produce two thousand

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:50,530
pieces of these routers and gave it to

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:54,880
the two thousand check internet users

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:58,210
for one check round for three years one

00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:04,530
check around this well less than once

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:08,110
and so it's a really really low price

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:11,810
because of that why it is so cheap

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:15,620
because the people who who get the

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,620
router they sign a contract with us that

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,949
they will share some information about

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,800
their network and able their network

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:30,639
flows with us and we are trying to

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:33,349
analyze these data and look there for

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,079
similar similar behaviors of attackers

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:39,349
and so on and thanks to these facts we

00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:45,170
are trying to well keep the internet

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:47,600
keep the end users safe when we found

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,970
something some some some attack we are

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,640
cooperating with a scissor team and he

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,800
is responsible them for contacting the

00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,709
user and tell him that something is

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,959
wrong how it all started in 2012 we

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:07,839
started with a project called catalogue

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:13,310
of routers and in this project we try to

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:19,459
analyze normally available small small

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:22,730
office home office routers and analyze

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:28,279
how was the status of these routers how

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:30,350
safe and how how good they are but after

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,800
one year of this project we found out

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,630
that the situation is quite terrible

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,839
home routers are definitely not up to

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:42,199
scratch there are security holes cheap

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:45,140
solutions cheap chips you can find a

00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:49,730
really cheap hardware solutions inside

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:52,519
and regarding the software it there is

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,850
really they are really slow at adopting

00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:01,160
new technologies like ipv6 DNS 6dn sec

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:04,490
and so on and if there is any security

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,800
hole or any other problem there are

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,290
almost no software updates so there is

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,420
no way how to get rid of these please

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,790
problems so in a year later into the in

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,529
2013 we decided to start with the

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:25,040
project tourists we decided

00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:28,029
we need our own hardware or at least a

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,499
hardware which runs our own software and

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:37,339
thanks to the software deliver delivers

00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:40,339
more more secure solution for for the

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:44,600
end user but about the hardware there

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:48,110
were three ways to go the first one was

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,059
using existing hardware and their put

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,170
their our own software this is really

00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:56,110
cheap and easy but we well I can tell

00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:03,680
you that we cannot find the right device

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:05,990
because there it was devices where they

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,459
doesn't have enough of ram and a storage

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:14,269
enough of CPU power so we try to ask few

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:18,980
manufacturers if they can modify the

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:22,129
router for to meet our needs this is a

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,579
little bit more expensive but who will

00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:28,910
modify only 1000 of devices if they

00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:33,879
normally produce like 100 thousands of

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:38,120
devices well nobody so we decided to go

00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:41,089
the third way make our own hardware this

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,680
is definitely not cheap and not easy but

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:51,019
you can learn a lot of things so this is

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:55,129
the output 0 for work the project

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:58,000
restauranteur well let's say in a

00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:02,779
comparison with other home routers this

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,029
let's say a beast if you understand at

00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:09,620
least a bit to the video embedded

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:11,240
hardware you can easily you can easily

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,600
see this see that from this

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,929
specification there is a dual pc

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:25,519
processor one point two gigahertz two

00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:31,699
gigabytes of ram 256 256 megabytes of

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:34,850
nand the hardware is able to route 1

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:38,430
gigabit per second without any problem

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,700
through USB 2 o's RTC chip this is quite

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,250
unusual but we need it for the DNS SEC

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:48,750
which is enabled by default there is

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:52,260
also a crypto chip which help us to feed

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:57,209
the entropy pool at the start up of the

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,580
device and of course I'm I must mention

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:04,560
the our killer feature which is the

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:06,899
dimmable RGB LEDs what's the operating

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,330
system which it which is inside the

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:15,149
three router well we call it to raise OS

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:16,380
but basically it's a fork of open wrt if

00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,680
you don't know there's a distribution

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,649
for home routers with 10 years long

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,740
history there are more than 3,000

00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:28,440
packages available and we gave all the

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,470
little through all the users root access

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,560
so you can modify the setup of the

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:38,250
router in any way you want why we

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,240
decided to do the fork well we wanted to

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:45,779
add at some some features we missed in

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,110
open wrt and the most important one is

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:54,209
automatic updates we are trying to

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,790
release every month a big release of new

00:13:54,209 --> 00:14:01,230
updates new versions of software and so

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:06,750
on but we do not stick to this plan and

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:10,620
sometimes we release updates or that's

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:13,589
usually this is when some when we know

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,690
about some problem with some important

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,740
software which which is inside the

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:22,680
router so just for example when we heard

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:26,430
about openssl hardly tour poodle problem

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,810
we were able to fix this box in all the

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:33,480
routers in a few days just prepare the

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,310
update and all the routers checks for

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,550
updates periodically so they will

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:42,240
download that immediately and update

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,600
itself automatically we also add there

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,230
some

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:52,360
some features which helps let's say your

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:57,190
normal users to set up their router

00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:00,279
without knowing not knowing much about

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,319
how the network verse works and so on so

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,480
the configuration wizard which is inside

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:09,370
is called forest it's written in Python

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,380
and you can see on the run on a few on a

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,800
few slides here it basically works as

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:19,089
well as I said configuration wizard so

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,610
it will help you to set up Wi-Fi it will

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,250
enforce the user to set up a strong

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,880
password so if the router doesn't work

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,259
without entering a strong password so

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:34,209
there is there shouldn't be a problem

00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:39,100
with keeping a demain admin in router

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:40,959
for for for the eternity also one of the

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,899
step in the wizard is updating the

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,860
router that's let the green the green

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:50,230
slides you can see there which which

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:55,120
software were elated at the first start

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:59,110
of the device and so on we also add

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:03,220
their software called Maya Domo and this

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:07,209
will help you to to have an overview of

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,610
which land clients talks to a rich

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,730
remote server this is this can be

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,420
helpful if you have just for example as

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:22,839
smart TV at your home and you want to

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:26,050
see where your Smart TV phones too so if

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,410
you can see in this in this application

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:33,130
that you're smart TVs sending something

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,569
to some Chinese servers you can be quite

00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:39,279
sure that there is something wrong

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:42,279
happening with your TV I told you about

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,579
the data collection so what are we

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:49,290
collecting we collect unsuccessful

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:52,630
connections and and from both directions

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:56,290
that means when some when somebody tries

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,100
to talk to a router but the port is

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,130
closed

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,910
or if there is no service which answer

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:09,010
to the questions we know about that also

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,930
when your router or any device behind

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,630
your router tries to communicate with a

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:19,300
remote server but the server doesn't

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:21,720
answer we log that too we also do our

00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,180
various statistics from from these

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:30,550
firewall logs we collect packet flows

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:34,720
that data we doesn't we don't do do deep

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:39,670
packet inspection but we look at the IP

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:43,270
address port and well SNI if you

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:46,090
communicate with with an HTTP server we

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:51,340
also collect Pink's we are trying to

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:55,200
pink few let's say important Internet

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:58,530
services like Facebook Gmail so on and

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:03,670
we are trying to compare this data and

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:05,890
have a knowledge on how easy or how is

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,800
your internet connection going and so on

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,360
how similar to the things we do

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,500
certificate collecting this is

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,770
definitely more interesting because we

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,760
are trying again to connect connect to

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,000
Facebook and other services like this

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,980
and compare the certificates we get from

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,590
this from the server so if we know that

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,170
1000 of users get the same certificate

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,690
but one of one of them have different

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,970
one then we again know that there is

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,400
there is something something wrong and

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,470
we can contact the CC r then he will

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:48,330
contact the user and so on we also have

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:53,440
have software called called mini pods

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:56,050
that same well similar to honeypot but

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,130
it's it's small so we call it a mini

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,190
pods that's a telnet server which do

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,520
just

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:09,050
just just just the handshake big to log

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,560
in that means that we are able to look

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:15,080
how the ethical tries different login

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,320
information and so on thanks to this

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:22,010
fact we were able to catch quite big

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,850
botnet made of home routers I will tell

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,340
you about the later we also has

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,830
something called honey pot sa service

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,320
that means that the honey pot doesn't

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:38,420
doesn't run on the on the on the router

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:40,430
but or on our own server and if somebody

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,640
tries to connect to the ssh on the

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:46,730
router we basically do men in the middle

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:51,140
attack on them and redirect them on our

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:55,970
own server we then lock just like normal

00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,460
honey pot we lock all the all the all

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,740
the comments he the ethical shoot and on

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,010
the on the router and you can

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:07,970
comfortably see that on your own you're

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:12,230
on our web page through your profile we

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,870
use kaori fork for this if you are

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:22,370
interested you can see that on our

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:25,580
github on this link well when I'd tell

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,730
anybody about data collection they

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:32,930
always tell me that he doesn't want such

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:36,140
a router at home well so why you

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:40,460
shouldn't be worried we have got a

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:43,250
positive big brother ever in 2013 we

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:47,210
have separate separate database for

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,510
accounts and for betas and we also

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,930
consulted our whole solution with the

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:56,690
Personal Data Protection Authority and

00:20:52,930 --> 00:21:02,730
we keep your data only for 10 days then

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:07,260
it is deleted and our lost 44

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:10,110
so what will you get for well you share

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,179
some some some kind of that data with us

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:16,320
so what will you get for four days for

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,600
that for example you can see different

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,169
kinds of Statistics this is one of them

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:26,220
so you can see the share of ipv4 and

00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:28,799
ipv6 in your communication well this is

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:33,720
from my router so you can see a I'm

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:38,970
quite i'm using quite a lot of 5p v 6

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:43,309
and another another thing is passive

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:48,210
bandwidth monitoring so we monitor

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:51,000
what's well how do you how you use the

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:55,830
bandwidth of clear connection so you can

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,860
you can judge from from this you can

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:01,590
judge how well if you need infinite

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,120
faster connection or slower connection

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:08,340
you can judge it from this from these

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:11,669
graphs I told you about the hypothesis

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:15,299
service and this is this is the UI where

00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:19,890
you can see what the attacker done or

00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:23,190
try to land on a router so you can see

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:27,260
here that somebody from China try to

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:31,049
connect to a router then he tried to

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:36,030
stop stop the 55 all different kinds of

00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:40,380
firewall then he tried to download a

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:44,490
file called shower and try to execute

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:47,130
that and there are lots of lots of other

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:50,940
attackers who probably tried something

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:54,090
something similar now we know about

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,280
every attacker from from every router so

00:22:54,090 --> 00:23:01,679
again you can share this data with our

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:05,010
sis your team and if there is lots of

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,400
with lots of similarities they can learn

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:12,080
other users that there is some some new

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,420
oh say danger

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,560
was the biggest catches of the project

00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:25,380
to race we found two botnets the first

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:27,620
one was or is made from asus routers the

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,220
button at the bottom it has more than

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:34,800
ten thousands of devices and we found

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,610
them through the mini pods because we

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,790
found out that at in the same time a

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:45,270
lots of attackers tries to connect to

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:50,360
the telnet telnet ports on the routers

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:55,590
and use the same series of logins so we

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:58,410
get the all the IP address and put it

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:02,460
into Shah den and he will he told us

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:04,860
that all of them are well almost the

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,950
same asus routers so we both wore one of

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,520
the one of the models and connected to

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:15,060
the internet well and in a few days we

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,820
were part of the botnet as well and the

00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:22,490
second one was made of ubiquity air

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:27,120
router there were around six and a half

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:31,040
thousands of devices and well the

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:35,160
problem with these routers were not so

00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:40,470
not so bad but still well the users just

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:43,440
enabled a remote remote management but

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,810
left there the default login that means

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,490
had made a min or something similar

00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:54,000
doesn't matter so it's a lot of false of

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:56,460
the router but maybe the router should

00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,240
enforce the user to set up a stronger

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,600
password before they can enable the

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,230
remote management they also found a few

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:11,460
user pcs connected to botnets like Zeus

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:14,880
and so on and we found out quite a lot

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,380
of highest piece who breaks in

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,890
International trilogy or network

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,930
neutrality that means they are really

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:26,340
redirecting communications to their own

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:29,950
servers typically they don't want to

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:36,820
they don't let you to connect to remote

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:42,370
smtp servers or they try to redirect

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:44,800
your DNS traffic and so on we we think

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,930
that this is another good behavior so

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,660
again we contacted them and told them

00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:55,180
there are better ways how to how to

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:58,030
protect the users oh well most of the

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:02,140
data or add all of the data we cannot

00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:07,320
share it with anybody but we try to also

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:10,450
help other other people to stay safe so

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,050
at least we we have something called

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:17,860
gray list IP greatest and this this

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:20,980
means that we measure behavior of

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:27,060
attackers on which attacks the routers

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:31,990
and or let's say remote pcs who tries to

00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:36,430
connect to a router we look on that this

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:40,270
communication and we gave a score to

00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:43,150
each IP address for example if a

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:47,560
particular r.i.p others tries to scan a

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:50,620
one router that means well score minus 5

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:54,670
plus 3 and if the same IP address tries

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:59,500
to scan ports on thousands routers that

00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:04,020
means score minus thousand and if an IP

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:07,000
address get some amount of minus score

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,080
we will put it on the IP address Bray

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,200
list and its refresh to regenerate every

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:20,400
week the screenshot below it that's from

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:25,090
some tool from our cease your theme and

00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,630
every column represents an IP address of

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:32,890
an attacker from

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:35,780
our IP arraylist and this this blue row

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:40,040
means that the IP addresses from from

00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:44,150
truth other rose means that the IP

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:50,360
address was caught also in different

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:53,630
other services which CC team scanned for

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,460
for similarities so you can see that we

00:27:53,630 --> 00:28:05,750
are quite successful in a you know

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:08,480
measuring the bad behavior even while

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:11,810
the tourist project we're quite

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,880
successful and or we think that it was

00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:17,570
quite successful and a lot of lots of

00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,020
people ask us if they can buy the router

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,770
and use it in let's say well any

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,090
anywhere outside of the Czech Republic

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,460
unfortunately this was not possible do

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,910
it to some rules of we set for the

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,230
router for the project but we told

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,220
ourselves that maybe we should do

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:41,110
something with it so we made an new

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,520
router or we work on that right now and

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,650
this is the answer for the high demand

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,090
for the previous theories it's called

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:53,210
story somnia and it's this one the first

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,910
plan was to make a price of price

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:59,090
optimized tourists because this the

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:02,990
previous one was quite quite expensive

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:06,500
but as a side effect well the router is

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:13,250
just just better in every way it's more

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:17,630
powerful less power-hungry and so on we

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:21,040
decided to found to fund the project

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:26,210
through the IndieGoGo so we set up a

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:32,660
target for 100,000 US dollars and we hit

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:37,280
the target in 23 hours right now the the

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:39,230
campaign already ended but right now

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,100
it's in in diamond mode

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:45,669
so you can still buy it and we we

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:56,570
gathered almost 1 million u.s. dollars

00:29:45,669 --> 00:30:02,690
which i think is quite a lot well so

00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:09,530
what's the hardware thanks again we are

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:13,850
really proud let's see the processor is

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:17,299
armed Marvel Armada dual-core again 1.6

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:21,020
gigahertz the power consumption is well

00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:26,330
round six bots in a normal usage but it

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:28,880
can be as low as as 4.3 wats there is

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:34,880
only one gigabyte of RAM but you can pay

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:39,470
for ram upgrades only nigo go there is 4

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,970
gigabytes of emmc memory sfp port which

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:49,910
is quite unusual on home routers to you

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:54,470
book USB 3 o's programmable RGB LEDs 3

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:57,530
mini PCI Express slots and one of them

00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,900
is switchable to the msata mode so you

00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,510
don't need to do anything just by SSD

00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:06,169
SSD hard disk or reduction to the

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,750
standard SATA port and put it put it to

00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:13,190
the slot and you can use it for for

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:16,340
connecting your hard disk ah and the

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:20,110
third mini pci express slot is prepared

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:26,230
for connecting LTE modem so there is a

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:31,400
sim card a sim slot again there is RTC

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:35,390
and crypto chip we also be like

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:38,990
raspberry pi so we wanted to have a at

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:40,970
least similar similar pinch pins which

00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:44,540
are available on the on the Raspberry Pi

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:50,250
so there there is a there is a pin

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:56,070
header where you can find 10 gpio ports

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:59,220
to you arts spi and I to see so if you

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,970
are really into do it yourself with

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,640
electronics and so on I think you'll be

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,350
oh maybe happy and maybe you will

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,800
replace your Raspberry Pi with the

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:15,930
recently oh this is the this is

00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:19,910
schematic so how how the internet

00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:23,570
internal network connection looks like

00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:28,470
this is again quite highly unusual

00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:32,850
across home routers the CPU has three

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:37,460
ethernet interfaces first one is

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:41,280
connected to the LAN port and the reason

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:45,440
there is or between one and sfp slot so

00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:50,550
when if you put sfp module to the sfp

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,560
all the sfp the one part is immediately

00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:58,350
switched to the sfp if you remove it

00:32:52,560 --> 00:33:02,580
it's switch back to the theater net the

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:05,460
rest of the two interfaces are connected

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,880
to the switch chip and the switch ship

00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:13,610
is fully manageable so it's really up to

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,790
you how how will you set up it you can

00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:20,340
you can let's say that the first three

00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:24,780
ports will be connected to the port five

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:29,010
that means eth0 and the rest through the

00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:32,360
port six to the eth one F and then have

00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,360
a while

00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:44,240
well you can you can let your leave your

00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:49,250
length Lions separate oh this is how how

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:53,630
the board looks like well I think that

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:57,020
all of you are able to see the USB and

00:33:53,630 --> 00:34:02,150
SME this is the battery holder processor

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,710
and so on if you want to well you will

00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,049
have any questions just ask me after

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:10,720
them and you can discuss it with his

00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:15,859
prototype software software is the same

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:19,010
as with the previous stories that means

00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:22,070
three so as for Coco open wrt it has the

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:24,800
same feature set automatic updates and

00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:29,389
data collecting but it can be turned off

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,389
and the policy is opt-in and because if

00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:35,570
you buy through so many I you are not

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:39,290
part of the tourist project by default

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:42,440
and that means that you can you can load

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:45,440
in today to the hardware any software

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,590
you want I'm already I already know

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,090
about some some guys who are eager to

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:54,950
try put openbsd to the hardware and so

00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,680
on and we will be happy to cooperate

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:04,400
with them once we will have some free

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:06,380
prototypes it almost will always like to

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,470
say that this is more than just router

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,660
because it's really really powerful so

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,690
you can use it as a decent home server

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,540
for file sharing backup services and

00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:20,890
thinking on we already know about some

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,300
people who use the all the tourists as a

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:27,440
let's say do it yourself home automation

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:29,540
center there are two software packages

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,280
for this one is one of them is called

00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,460
home assistant to the second one is

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,490
domotics if you know about them you can

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,680
you can use it without any problems you

00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:45,080
can use the routers also as a tour

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:49,490
gateway or use other out so paralyzed

00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:52,760
as the not dns server bird and many more

00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:58,750
VPN without any problems 100 megabits

00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:01,160
per second in measured through the VPN

00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,170
everything as I as I said we love open

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,480
source so everything is open source and

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,600
open hardware bootloader operating

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,930
system power management server if we

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,630
forget some something just ask us and we

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:18,200
have no problems to release it we will

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,960
release also schematics and the full

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:25,670
production documentation but with a

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,580
little Lilly well some some people told

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:32,720
us that they found some discussion in

00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:36,190
Chinese on some Chinese forum and if

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:45,890
they are they would they would love to

00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:48,980
produce it before us if you want one

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,990
I'll be really happy it's as I says I

00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:54,830
already told you it's still available

00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:58,610
through indiegogo just take a look at

00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:02,780
this link or follow the key or the link

00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:06,460
in the QR code and this is all i

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,460
prepared to thank

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:30,460
any questions yep certificates

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:42,810
that's a now we have different kind of

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:47,089
software we do not collect it on the

00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:51,690
let's say pocket level but we normally

00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:54,900
through some some program or let's say a

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:59,400
fool connect to the server and download

00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,920
the certificate so it's just for just

00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,540
for the certificates we do do not as I

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:12,560
said we do not do the duplicating the

00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:20,609
deep packet inspection you know a while

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:26,369
for them for the certificate collect yes

00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:30,329
I yeah I understand these things we we

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:33,420
do that on regular basis let's say twice

00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:35,849
a week we will connect to the remote

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,390
service as I the facebook and so on and

00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:42,260
I'm download a certificate and put them

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:49,040
in the comparison from all the routers

00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:51,530
so that doesn't mean that we we do not

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,380
we are not looking on the certificate

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:57,950
every time when the user are connected

00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,950
to the Facebook

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:22,680
yeah yeah that's our connection our own

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:25,630
connection from our own to we there is a

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:32,950
body fold there is a package manager

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:35,590
called opkg I think and we try to update

00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,530
it as a normal as a normal energy

00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:41,260
distribution there is a there is a

00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:47,460
script as a rapper script around the

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:51,040
opaque opkg and it regularly asks for

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:54,670
for the update and then update every

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,150
like like well it's the same as well as

00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:01,380
if you update your notebook with Linux

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,380
what is the same

00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:14,850
well it's not that easy because there is

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:17,890
aa we alway always release a plan how to

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:22,510
do the update because there is sometimes

00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:25,840
there is a thing so you need to take

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:46,510
care money manually and it's with the

00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:49,780
reason for it for the blends well we

00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:53,380
contacted the CCS team and tell them

00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:59,760
about the problem and share all the

00:40:53,380 --> 00:41:02,530
information with them if it is well a

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,820
problem similar to you ssss routers

00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:08,560
which attacked the Taurus Taurus routers

00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,680
there is no way how to contact them

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:16,680
because usually that's you know routers

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:21,300
from russia south of south america

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:26,910
you don't know who to contact but if it

00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:29,790
is user-pc connecting to the zeros and

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:33,690
similar botnets again CC will contact

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:36,740
the user and send them an email about

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,540
the problem and an information how to

00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,849
have the fight with the problem and they

00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:55,829
can freely contact them if they don't

00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:58,470
know what to do well it it could be

00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:02,010
possible but we do not support any any

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:06,150
other hardware in our own but if you

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:09,450
have a router powerful enough I can

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:14,700
imagine how few of them I can tell you

00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:17,520
later yeah it can it can be possible but

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:22,440
maybe there will be a few few obstacles

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:25,559
with the open wrt s buildroot if you

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,980
think stay tuned and so on but yeah it

00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,980
can be possible

00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,420
you

00:42:50,510 --> 00:43:05,960
oh if you'll if you ask us or tell us

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:11,860
that you want to buy a 100 1000 filming

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,860
us will be really happy to talk to you

00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:26,180
what not yet but we plan to upstream all

00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:31,870
the changes we make right now it's

00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:34,610
basically about DTS tuning and there is

00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:37,700
maybe I'm not ever above any other

00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:40,640
problems right now yeah out of time

00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,480
sorry okay like we have 4.4 Colonel

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,480
right now

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,640
thank you

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:56,940
