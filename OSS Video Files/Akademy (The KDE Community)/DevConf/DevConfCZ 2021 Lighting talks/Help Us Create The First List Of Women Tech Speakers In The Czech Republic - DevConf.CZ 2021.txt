Title: Help Us Create The First List Of Women Tech Speakers In The Czech Republic - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-02-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021 Lighting talks
Description: 
	At CyberMagnolia we believe it's important for tech conferences & meetups to have diverse speakers lineups. As some of our members are community & event organizers, we know how hard it is to find ladies willing to talk about their work.

Help us create the first list of women tech speakers in the Czech Republic by recommending women whose work you appreciate and would like to hear more about at the next technology event.

and the vision behind it there's two

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,360
things we would like to achieve

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
one of them is um to

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
connect women working in technology

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,680

seniority or a job description

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
