Title: Success factors: Why am I using Scrum or Kanban - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Hina Popal, Dominika Bula

When people talk about Agile, two of the most popular words that are associated with it are Scrum and Kanban. How did this happen when the Agile Manifesto is a set of values and principles that never prescribed fixed rules to follow? After working with many teams, there were common factors that enabled success regardless of which framework was being used. Those factors are built into the Scrum and Kanban processes. In this talk we will go over what the success factors are, why they are effective, and how Scrum and Kanban have built them into their processes.

The five success factors we have identified are:
- Transparency of current work (kanban or scrum board)
- Understand team priorities (grooming, top to bottom in kanban)
- Understanding scope of work and why (acceptance criteria, descriptions)
- Improving the way you actually work (retro, kaizen)
- Scoping work so you can see progress along the way (sprints, work in progress limits)

all right well Frankie Chuck did

00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,420
introduce me as his colleague hina

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,850
I am a natural practitioner at Red Hat

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,420
and pretty much I hope that this is

00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,800
something that is a very foundational

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,990
information but a lot of people are

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,699
missing it so let me see if we can

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,699
change your minds between Tommy and I

00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:30,569
heinous print as you heard I'm seeing a

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,460
lot of familiar faces here in the

00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,649
audience many folks that we are working

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,269
with on the daily basis and two-hour

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,239
sessions will be asking you to

00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:41,100
participate with the feedback so I just

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,780
wanted to set up the ground rules we

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,429
will be asking the questions but will be

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,829
not passing the mic so I will be

00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,219
repeating your answers there might be

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,460
prizes I think we're ready to start at

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,379
this point so let's dive in all right

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,929
let's get started so before you have

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,290
success factors for agility you have to

00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,870
become agile and often how does someone

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,950
become agile does anyone practice scrum

00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:15,870
or Kanban in this room all right how

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,310
many scrums and how many Condon's all

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,590
right there's gonna be a quiz at the end

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,240
so I remembered all of you okay I would

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,140
like someone to volunteer their

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,050
experience if they switch to agile how

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:38,870
did it happen for them did they get any

00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:38,870
training any any life lessons tell me

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,299
all right

00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:07,149
so that's very promising that there was

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,950
minor training and attempts and of

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,250
course hesitancy that's quite the

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,319
formula for coming to ad EULA T

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,360
oftentimes when people say that they're

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,390
gonna move to agility they're actually

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,560
told hey we are gonna deliver perfectly

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,569
and we're gonna use something called

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,819
scrum but I'm not gonna really tell you

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,879
much about it right so when people go

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,680
and they move to scrum what happens now

00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,049
that we've had enough people practicing

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
scrum there is a quite a bit of a

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:38,170
reputation and nine times out of 10

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,799
people who are doing scrum will tell you

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:45,310
that it's daily stand up right and shake

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:48,430
your head yes and down yeah okay and

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:52,690
it's also meetings all day is that

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,599
correct yes okay and then there's my

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,299
favorite the misunderstood child Kanban

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,430
the anti scrum something with less

00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:05,200
process that will still let you be agile

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,950
and what is Kanban creating carts but

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,420
what is a card

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,120
we don't really know cuz we don't have a

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,630
process so we don't care and also what

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,400
is comp on right they just say it's the

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,780
anti scrum and let's do this magical

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,739
thing so let's get into actually

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,090
becoming agile teams go from this and

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,099
then they have a little bit of Education

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,200
or maybe they don't and they find

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,829
something that works for them but step

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,169
two to becoming agile is learning that

00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,970
it's just a mindset so when you think

00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,180
about scrum and you think about Kanban

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,329
they're ways to deliver software they

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,280
fall under the agile methodology but

00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,280
their frameworks there's a set of steps

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,260
so when someone prescribes you to do

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,000
agile they're actually not telling you

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,240
how to do work they're telling you how

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,240
to think about a pro

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,000
your work and often that is the

00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,740
foundational piece that's missing how

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,200
many people got that message when they

00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,900
started their agile journey of hey it's

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,700
not a set of rules but here's kind of

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:13,040
the mindset we want you to approach when

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,840
you're working anyone okay well a very

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,910
underwhelming amount of people I think

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,430
that was for and this is quite a large

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,800
room so let's tell you a little bit

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,700
about it and then hopefully when you get

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,340
back to work

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,410
hopefully not until Monday at least

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:32,780
you'll take a look at what we tell you

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:37,600
today all right so we have such a

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,600
practitioners I think we skip one slight

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,850
other practice team is growing in Red

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,710
Hat we as HR practitioners are trying to

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,530
focus with our teams that they

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,270
understand principle principles first

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,160
but what is that they are doing on the

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:59,560
daily basis is that some team you scrams

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,840
some teams use Kanban many of them after

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,970
testing it for themselves it's they're

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,370
coming up with some hybrid approach that

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,130
works for them the best I would like to

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,010
talk about how this looks how the

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,710
methodology looks from the perspective

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,530
of scrum how it works he now will dive

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,510
in into more details of Kanban just to

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,910
create a shared understanding what are

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:26,390
the ground rules for play with scrum and

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,940
Kanban so scrub is very popular because

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,670
it's a lightweight easy to understand

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,770
process this is why many teams would be

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:37,190
adapting that this is perfect for

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,660
executing complex knowledge work so if

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,600
you are working in the complex

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:45,020
environment scram will probably work

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,340
scram will probably work for you you

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,560
need to keep in mind that there are

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,010
specific rules for play so there are

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,860
team roles there are specific ceremonies

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,710
they are scrum artifacts like product

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,419
increment product backlog and sprint

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:07,069
backlog all of this is focusing on

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:11,369
interactive change in the time boxed

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:13,469
this is of periods of time so we go in

00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:17,309
the attractive interactive cycle of

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:19,579
improvement here on the back of all of

00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:22,319
that the most important is that this

00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,659
methodology is focusing on three pillars

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,309
it's empirical process so therefore we

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:31,919
have inspection adoption and improvement

00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:34,169
the process has to be transparent to

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,139
work and people who are using this

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,819
process at the back of their head should

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,129
remember what are the core values of

00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,019
scram and one of the them is very

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,339
similar to what record beliefs is

00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:51,169
openness then we have courage commitment

00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:53,550
focus we share we have a common as a

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,819
organization we have common values to

00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,569
those scram values therefore that mostly

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:04,879
works for our teams now we'll move on to

00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,879
details of how combat works

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:10,589
all right here's Kanban I'm gonna give

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:13,439
you a quick overview keep in mind this

00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:16,619
is not everything if you have questions

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,849
I'll be here all weekend the quick

00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:21,569
overview of Kanban

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:24,809
is you are visualizing your workflow and

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:27,119
you are moving things across that

00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:30,209
workflow so you have to define work

00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:33,509
because their units of work and here's a

00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:35,669
big big thing that a lot of people don't

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,059
know and this was recently proven when I

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:42,659
mentioned this all of these things these

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:46,139
units of work should be of similar size

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,809
ideally the same size how has anyone

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,499
heard that before

00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:55,800
does anyone practice that ok and I know

00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:59,099
he does the one that raised his hand he

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,989
does believe it so why do they have to

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,789
be of similar size you're moving things

00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:05,009
through a system kind of like a factory

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:07,679
because this is all inspired by the

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:10,199
Toyota Production system and what you do

00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,149
is you define how it goes through the

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,309
factory just as you would build a car

00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:15,749
you start with certain pieces and you

00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:18,179
move it down the line the production

00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:20,580
line and so with Kanban you're doing the

00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:22,050
same thing you are

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,060
exactly understanding how it goes

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,310
through the system and you're defining

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,300
what has to be done and you're keeping

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,250
it very very simple the only thing that

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,229
I'll add to this because I can go in for

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,560
about the next two hours to talk about

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,029
Kanban is if you look at the top you'll

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,529
see numbers so if you look at the word

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:46,500
pending at the first column they're six

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:49,500
that's something called a limit so what

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,810
we can do is we can overwhelm ourselves

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,000
by putting in every kind of work that we

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,399
can or we can do the Kanban style and

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,829
limit ourselves and that'll allow us to

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,260
focus that number at the top is called a

00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:04,440
work in progress limit and you'll see

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:10,079
why that's helpful in a little bit so

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:12,269
now I'll hand it over to dami yeah so we

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,750
were keeping in mind adult principles

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:18,750
like I mentioned before many teams adopt

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,370
scrum some of them convert to Kanban in

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,589
the middle of the way because they feel

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,180
this is more suitable in some cases they

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,060
go back and forth because they wanna

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,140
retest the approach I see Tamar smiling

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:35,459
and we have so-called favorite

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,350
approaches that teams are working on we

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,000
as other practitioners are fine with

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,170
that and we're observing this team's

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,180
work and being successful and we mapped

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,670
we mapped out some success criteria

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,740
among these teams and I'm very excited

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,570
to present on this a success criterias

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,850
today because this is hopefully

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,579
something you can take home and apply to

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,279
your work with the teams starting from

00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:02,399
Monday those are like little changes

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,199
that can be made and checkpoints that

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,120
you can keep in the back of your head to

00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:11,279
refer to later on so to make things even

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,990
more straightforward we'll be talking

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,699
about five criterias of success for the

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,610
teams that are working with agile

00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:23,269
methodologies and first one of them will

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,670
be transparency then we look into the

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:29,310
priorities and prioritizing of work

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,880
scoping of work creating a shared

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,350
understanding within the teams and

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,079
incremental improvement

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:41,940
we'll be presenting this SuccessFactors

00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:46,560
using the metaphor of the coffee cups

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,509
because this is a main theme of the deaf

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,180
communities years who got their coffee

00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:54,810
cup already do you guys have your coffee

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,100
cups clave great so we'll be presenting

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:01,079
the success factors based on the

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,029
metaphor of the coffee cups and just one

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,940
thing to keep in the back of your mind

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,899
is that one cup represents one unit of

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,690
work all right

00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:15,000
so transparency means being open and

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,000
honest not only about our progress and

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,120
achievements but also about our issues

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,670
and our setback okay what does that mean

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,660
first step one is looking at the photos

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,589
because this is a very cup oriented

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,690
presentation we're gonna have a little

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:38,120
bit of fun with this if you look at the

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:41,540
top photo that is day to day work and

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,740
what can you tell me is going on there

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:50,040
anyone do we know what we're working on

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:55,079
no well clearly someone did the dishes

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,120
because there's nothing there okay but

00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,190
the reality is we're actually working on

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,720
a lot if you look at the bottom photo

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:05,970
that's everything that's going on and we

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,190
only know that because we see it it's in

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,410
front of us we can visualize it it's

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,889
displaying our work I can see with my

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,410
eyes I know that I can have real-time

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:19,170
status updates I know if there's an

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,720
atomic cup in the queue or a fedora cup

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,199
in the queue right because it's there in

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,439
front of me and when you know what's

00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:30,870
going on what do you not need to

00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:34,139
micromanage does anyone like being

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,329
micromanaged show Vance okay this one

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:40,889
this time I got none oh I got half I got

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:43,649
half but also that knowledge in that

00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:46,139
open communication makes a trustful

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,950
environment because our cards are out on

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,690
the table there's nothing to hide

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,480
there's nothing to be anxious about I

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,670
know exactly what's going on so I don't

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,920
have to wonder are you working on this

00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,040
PR are you working on that PR it's

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,620
already there I already know and that

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,140
awareness improves communication because

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,170
I know I'm able to facilitate the

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,750
conversations I need which is really

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,060
important so the one thing I do want to

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,520
add because I had this thought while

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,350
brushing my teeth in the morning was all

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,380
of these principles that we're teaching

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,810
you all of this these ideas they apply

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,960
to both individual work and team work

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:28,360
often people say I work by myself I

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,460
don't have to worry about this but the

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,620
reality is someone who works by

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,040
themselves it's still important for them

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,020
to be organized to scope their work to

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,180
be transparent the only thing they're

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,030
not doing is working together with

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,370
someone so they're talking to themselves

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:49,230
when they communicate the difference

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:53,860
between individual work and team work is

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,990
just talking to someone so that

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,510
communication part is gonna be very

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,970
important but remember if you just work

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,390
on stuff yourself everything in this

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:07,540
presentation will apply to you as well

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:10,510
so now now that we know what

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,010
transparency can look like I'm gonna ask

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,020
everyone who has a little bit of

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,790
familiarity and if you don't know that's

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,640
fine we're here to talk you through it

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,540
about how scrum can show you

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,630
transparency do we have anyone who wants

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:30,670
to take a shot at telling us how does

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:34,050
scrum give you transparency daily

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,050
stand-ups how so

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,370
all right I'm gonna rephrase that

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,640
because it was pretty spot-on

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,040
everyone shares their status so everyone

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,350
on the team knows what's going on that's

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:55,470
absolutely correct anything else about

00:14:49,350 --> 00:15:06,350
how scrum shows transparency okay it was

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:06,350
still random all right I'll take that

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:16,110
all right very cool and let's move over

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:26,100
to Kanban how does Kanban give you

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:27,950
transparency right all right I'm hearing

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,130
common trends about you can see things

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,130
one more

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:40,050
absolutely all right

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:42,090
and so to keep it simple yes all of your

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,970
work is visualized in both scrum and

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,800
Kanban you can see it ideally if you

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,620
keep it up to date please keep it up to

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,840
date because I'm an agile practitioner

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,730
and then also the little addition from

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,740
scrum great one our first answer I

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,500
didn't actually anticipate to hear that

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,270
is stand up you're putting everything on

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,900
the table because you're keeping it very

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:06,510
simple and updating everyone on usually

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,770
a daily basis we'll talk about how it's

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:15,630
okay to tailor things a little bit later

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:19,890
next up the second factor of succeeding

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,770
with agile bring your work with teams is

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:25,740
prioritization agile teams use

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:29,730
prioritization to confirm that they

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,760
deliver the value and that means that we

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,500
are not prioritizing just at the

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,800
beginning of the project when we get a

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,720
project chart we keep prioritizing

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,120
through our project so it's very

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,460
important to go back and reprioritize

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,430
that to-do list that you have when you

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,769
have more work coming because it's it

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,290
more

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,480
like it is most likely that some of

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,550
these items that you might be already

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,639
working on have a lower priority than

00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:01,509
what is currently brought to the table

00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:04,720
fertilization is one of very important

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:08,559
aspects of the agile process and we need

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,020
to remember and ask ourselves when the

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:16,569
leaver delivering daily work how is that

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:19,569
bringing value to the customer from

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:21,760
experience we heard feedback that well

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,610
my team doesn't have customer I don't

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,350
have a direct interaction with the

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,939
customer so how would I know these

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,620
things there will be other people who

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,240
should be knowing how to prioritize I'm

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,960
just working on what is given on the

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,580
table then our advice will be if you

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,740
don't have a customer you most likely

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,370
have a consumer of your work somebody

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,480
who is depending on your work then it's

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:49,000
important to make a note that hey am i

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,330
blocking with somebody with that work

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,529
that I'm doing on the daily basis is

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,220
there anything that we can do

00:17:53,529 --> 00:18:01,750
differently to bring the most value and

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:03,549
this is driving the point that driving

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,659
the point to the second agile principle

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,580
that agile teams welcome change late

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,100
also late in development they are not

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,770
getting frustrated oh my god we work on

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,830
all of that work and now this is wasted

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,679
this is not the point if we know how to

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,090
prioritize we know that if we work or

00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,730
not something that we are no longer

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,299
going to use first of all we learned

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:32,520
something but second of all we also know

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:35,950
that this is not a big deal because

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,529
something goes from the pile of to-do

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:41,590
items and something is replaced by that

00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:44,230
and if everybody in the team have a

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,809
shared understanding of this we can move

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:53,380
on as a team and compile complete the

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:55,899
most viable work and talking about scrum

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,429
and Kanban do you have idea how is that

00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:59,620
represented in the specific

00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,660
methodologies if we will talk about

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:06,250
scrum first where is that

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:14,950
prioritization factor coming to

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:17,650
importance right so we are grooming the

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:21,520
backlog in scram I heard backlog order

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:24,010
which is also applying for Kanban the

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,450
items that are most important will be on

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,820
the top of your list

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,790
so the idea should be a person driving

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,480
this backlog and looking into the items

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:36,340
to do on your boards to make sure that

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,430
they are prioritized the challenge is

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,000
that sometimes we are so busy creating

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:47,620
the items to work on that

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,420
not necessarily them the most pride the

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,160
priority items will be work on first

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,140
right because we are like okay we have

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,030
this cart we'll go and work on this but

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,660
it was that the car that should be done

00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:01,300
first the dependencies mapping and

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,870
priorities might be challenged in that

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,110
aspect

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:08,290
so make a mental note before taking a

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,030
new task to do ask yourself how is that

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,970
bringing value to my team and other

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:18,910
teams that are cooperating with me could

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:20,820
something be done better all right so

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,810
let's get into something called scoping

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,280
to read the quote because it's always

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:29,020
fun this scoping is necessary to in

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,840
order to come up with the right number

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,840
of software releases the right sequences

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,660
of those releases the dependencies among

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,200
the requirements and those the

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,450
deliverables and scope for each release

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,250
without this crucial step the process of

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,820
breaking an application into software

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:54,820
releases would be completely arbitrary

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:57,040
which means pretty much useless so let's

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,090
take a look at the cups again I'm gonna

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,580
ask for your help

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:04,480
at the top remember this is our work

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:07,810
this is our work queue first can someone

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,350
tell me how that top list of work makes

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,350
them feel

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,690
they're all right you know what I can

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,410
see where you're coming from because now

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:25,280
I'm thirsty as well but did they think

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:27,980
that let's say for two people they can

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:35,050
drink all of those cups within a day

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:38,840
maybe ideally if you're hydrating well

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:41,000
but often not know so then let's go to

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:47,210
the bottom do you think that's easier to

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,760
consume all right all right so scoping

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,990
work basically is exactly that you're

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,179
understanding how much can be done

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,720
within reason no I can't drink all of

00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:00,170
those cups in a day maybe not even two

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,350
days they're big cups you're also

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,340
focusing on short-term progress and it's

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,400
gonna help you with long-term

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,400
predictability it'll allow you to

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,900
collect metrics so maybe I drank these

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,360
two cups and then I realized I could fit

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,090
in another cup of tea and I'll be able

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,370
to understand that because I collected

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,120
that metric and it'll help us forecast

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,340
our work and that means all right so if

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,160
I know that on average I drink three

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:36,050
cups a day how many cups do I think I

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,580
can drink tomorrow probably three right

00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,470
there's always a little bit of wiggle

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,910
room but that room for error will

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:45,080
decrease the more I get to know myself

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:47,390
the more I I test this metric out so

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:52,070
let's talk about how this cut these cups

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:54,260
relate to scrum and Kanban I'm not gonna

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,030
go one-by-one I'm just gonna ask can

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,360
someone tell me how do they think that

00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:10,270
this scoping work is built-in to scrum

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:10,270
or Kanban okay anything else

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:24,190
mm-hmm right absolutely

00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:27,009
all right and to show you because we've

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,950
created these slides in scrum you have

00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:32,619
sprint cycles and in Kanban you have

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,239
work-in-progress limits remember I

00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:37,090
mentioned all work should be of the same

00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:38,710
size I do want to continue to drill that

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,200
in your head because it's something it's

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,809
the unsung hero of Kanban that's why

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,720
Kanban is the misunderstood child but

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:49,210
the easiest way for me to describe why

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,869
there are sprint cycles and why we are

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,629
trying to measure in kanmani you use

00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,950
throughput which is how fast one of

00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:59,049
those units of work can get through the

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,980
system and in scrum you have sprint

00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:05,440
cycles which are a defined set of time

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,019
for example two weeks three weeks four

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,239
weeks and they are repetitive

00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:12,340
so those sprint cycles will continuously

00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:15,879
be what you've defined as two weeks

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,090
three weeks four weeks and there is a

00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:21,100
big ask to not change those boundaries

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:23,169
unless you have practiced it and you see

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,419
that there's a need for some level of

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:28,690
flexibility and I'm gonna go to my

00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:30,970
friend physics and math for this so can

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:36,190
someone tell me from a physics

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:39,480
perspective what velocity is unless you

00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,830
forgot that's okay I can remind you

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,619
absolutely everyone is thinking of it

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,179
but we're a little shy that's okay

00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:51,159
velocity the measure of distance

00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:53,259
traveled with respect to time so why do

00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,289
we have these sprint cycles we want to

00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,450
collect our velocity why do we have our

00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:01,960
throughput because we want to measure

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:04,720
how much work we do with respect to that

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,840
time and that will essentially give us a

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,480
number that we can then measure against

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,889
every time we repeat the process in

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,720
Kanban your process is how much how fast

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,059
it takes you to get one unit of work

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,509
through the system so every time I drink

00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,840
a cup from the start to the finish that

00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:24,910
is

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,250
a measurement that's my metric for that

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,200
one I'll take everything I'll sum it up

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,070
and I'll use that as data points to help

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,290
predictability and for scrum it's pretty

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,420
much the same thing but you're

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:40,270
forecasting how much you can drink and

00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:43,360
let's say the week and then every week

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:46,810
you take it you go alright this week as

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,360
a team we drink 20 cups we thought we

00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,150
could drink 30 let's talk about why we

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,700
couldn't drink 30 but then we'll go

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,460
ahead and we will make a new forecast

00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,100
for our next sprint and the beauty of it

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:03,220
is that time doesn't change in the

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,440
sprints so we'll be able to now have yet

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,160
another data point and the more data you

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:15,970
have the better you can make predictions

00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:20,470
right yes okay and now hand it back to

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:22,510
Tommy so let's dive into what is the

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,000
shared understanding the shared

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,390
understanding is the thing that is

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,090
missing when the project is failing

00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:33,610
because everybody's thinking that they

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,580
kind of know what the other person is

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,170
doing but maybe they went on PTO and did

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,640
an updated heart

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:45,040
or maybe they work on one project

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,220
instead of the other one maybe they had

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,530
some kind of the customer support case

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,560
in the interim so the stuff that was

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:57,400
projected to be worked didn't get

00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,380
touched so the best way to grasp share

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,710
understanding is called consider what

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,130
happens when it's missing and this is

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:11,380
where we are starting to have a problems

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:13,150
in general like diving back to how the

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:17,350
share understanding looks like on our

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:19,360
cup metaphor we see the caps on the top

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,250
pictures there are five cups can you

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,380
tell what kind of projects is a team

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:29,440
working on you might have educated guess

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:33,070
right if you were familiar with this

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,039
type of swag or you are talking closer

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,539
to somebody on the team because you are

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,340
the calorie close to each other so we've

00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,789
had this discussion but at the team

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:46,960
level you are not sure you really have

00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:49,539
to have a closer look and have it

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,809
explicit what is going on right I see

00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:55,479
silver Blue is in progress we are

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:58,239
compiling specific things we are working

00:27:55,479 --> 00:28:01,149
with the PN T dev ops so there are

00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,999
improvements done to the team shared

00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:05,799
understanding is important to the team

00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:08,769
from the perspective that every single

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:11,470
one of us is different and we are coming

00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:14,049
with the knowledge that we gain through

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,779
our life this is a tacit knowledge that

00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:19,779
is not written on module pages on any

00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:22,899
kinds of directories in our company this

00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:25,269
is those are the things that we learned

00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:27,879
throughout the life then we have the

00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:32,080
expectations and the knowledge that is

00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:34,840
learned when we start onboarding to our

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:40,149
teams like we read specific guides we

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:43,179
read the documentation that is provided

00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:45,129
by the team and those two combined make

00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:50,399
us the team members for the specific

00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:53,409
teams but is important to remember that

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,710
there could be a lot of confusion so the

00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:59,889
discussion is needed on the daily basis

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,960
and we need to make sure that we create

00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:06,669
room to have and build this shirt

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,470
understanding within the team if not the

00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:10,629
testing team will be working on

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,389
something else than the development team

00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:16,269
we are being requested different thing

00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:18,999
than we are delivering final item of

00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:21,340
work and this is not what was respect

00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:24,940
expected from the people who requested

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,129
that from us so when you are not sure

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,940
what is that we were going to work or

00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:33,989
how that fits it's good to have the disk

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,989
kind of discussions

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:45,399
and now let's like recap how are we

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,289
applying that to scram and the Kanban so

00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:51,399
we scram we have an acceptance criteria

00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:53,710
and workflow definition of done design

00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:56,230
the same goes to Kanban when we are

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,639
looking at the task description and the

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,190
most important is that we are building

00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:02,019
awareness do you have some tips how to

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,549
make a better shirt and shirt

00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:05,549
understanding within your team's

00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:16,210
planning poker anything else that your

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,129
team might be using that might be of use

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,809
for other folks in the room that works

00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:35,049
well for you to create this shirt

00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:43,119
understanding on the team level thank

00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:45,190
you all right and this one I had to plug

00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,970
in one of my philosophers if anyone

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:51,159
knows me I love philosophy so knowing

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:55,809
yourself is the beginning of all wisdom

00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:59,320
and that's from our friend Aristotle why

00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:01,119
am i bringing this one up because we're

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,659
gonna talk about incremental improvement

00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,940
and instead of giving you two photos I'm

00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:10,629
giving you one so I'm gonna ask you

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:15,269
about this Cup is there anything

00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:20,769
different about this Cup it's broken

00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:23,279
kind of like other things in tech what

00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:23,279
would be broken

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:35,649
I didn't say anything okay so still

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:39,210
works well let's see but I have another

00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:41,889
question which often we forget to ask

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,409
you said the blanket statement of it's

00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:49,919
broken but let's make sure we all are on

00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:49,919
the same page why is it broken

00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:57,820
what makes it broken you can't use a

00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,720
handle absolutely

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,520
it seems obvious but in the beginning I

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,220
heard you can still use the cup which

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,710
there's truth in that but to be honest

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:12,340
if I saw the broken handle I'd be like

00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,840
can't use this cup what do I do now what

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,790
if it's my only cup or what if I don't

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,660
have time to go to the store and buy

00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:23,640
another cup how can we fix it is it

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:32,280
fixable well I have to dehydrate any

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:38,230
anyways to fix it glue it all right so

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:38,740
we just did a retrospective surprise all

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,810
right

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,790
we reviewed and we reflected we took a

00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,390
look at this and it was small it was

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,450
easy

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:49,750
we didn't philosophize at the meta level

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:52,960
cuz that one takes a lot longer to find

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:57,340
out about right we're setting small

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,050
attainable goals glue it absolutely I'm

00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,970
gonna try that I'm gonna try gluing this

00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:04,090
Cup it's a real cup we took the we took

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,250
these photos but if I heard something

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,400
like get some clay

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:11,710
go ahead I'd hear it see if that helps

00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,650
maybe bake it in the oven see if it

00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,540
solidifies any Potter's will know that

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:21,790
whatever I just said is complete trash

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:25,480
and that won't work but that's a lot

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:28,540
harder than gluing right it often times

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,880
in retrospectives we hear the go get

00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,590
some clay and then we're gonna put it in

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,380
the oven and then we're gonna bake it

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,420
and guess what what we tried because it

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:43,020
was first of all very complicated and

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:45,580
unqualified also didn't work again right

00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,830
the good thing is if we tried this small

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,590
glue and it didn't work we didn't waste

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:54,310
much time probably everyone has glue in

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,870
their kitchen in their office and if you

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:58,810
don't text your friend and if they're

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,820
coming over for a drinks or a cup of tea

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,200
just ask them to bring some glue its

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,120
little bit of a weird request but

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,390
they're your friends they should

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,970
understand and we also focused on what

00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,500
we can control

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:15,860
for example if more than the handle was

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:19,940
broken is it even worth having a

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:22,940
conversation what if this cup was

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:28,540
shattered into pieces you think I should

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:32,270
think about fixing it No and in

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:35,420
retrospective the main topics are what's

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:38,360
shattered into pieces that's out of our

00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,990
control half the time or we just know

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,690
that it's gonna be a long time so you

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,670
can put that thought into the universe

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,980
let the people who can maybe fix it over

00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:52,490
time or Reese trad ajay Zoar help you

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,110
out go ahead and tackle that while

00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:58,040
everything else is shattered into pieces

00:34:54,110 --> 00:35:00,200
and of course that's extreme verbage but

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,610
while everything else is in chaos say

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,250
you're going through a transformation

00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:06,740
it's totally okay to be hectic and

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:10,280
disruptive and uncomfortable anxiety

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,220
having a lot of anxiety about it but the

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,860
reality is you just put that thought

00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:19,250
into the universe you tell someone hey

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:22,910
this is why this is so uncomfortable and

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:25,220
let them go forward and you can focus on

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,730
what you're doing today take a look at

00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,620
the cup handle and glue it back together

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:34,580
so now I kind of gave you what's in

00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:38,420
scrum there's something called a Kaizen

00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:41,030
in Kanban it's pretty much of the same

00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,980
thing you're taking a look you're

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,210
reflecting and you're talking about how

00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:50,390
to improve but improvement comes from

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:52,520
inspection I looked at my surroundings I

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,760
looked at what's going on I looked at

00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:58,930
what's making my life difficult but I

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,640
asked myself the more questions about

00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:05,210
what's in my control that's making

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,210
myself difficult and then I make guesses

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:13,040
about small ways to fix it how many

00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:14,330
people have retrospectives like that how

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,559
many people have more meta-level

00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,689
retrospectives

00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:21,349
everything is broken I can't do this

00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:22,849
just one come on honest show of hands if

00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:23,359
you're listening I understand is after

00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,549
lunch

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,900
how many people have retrospectives to

00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:29,719
complain about things that are not in

00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,930
their control all right

00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,729
we woke some people up so what I'm gonna

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,380
tell you is the next time you have one

00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:38,499
of those retrospectives cut it out

00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:42,019
because it's a waste of your time and

00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:44,150
there's too many meetings in the day to

00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:47,420
have those discussions every two weeks

00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:50,900
once a quarter yeah go for it

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:53,569
every two weeks it's not worth thinking

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,150
about how do i glue small pieces of

00:36:53,569 --> 00:37:02,989
ceramics back together that will shatter

00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:05,239
in two seconds anyway so we're gonna

00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:07,670
close out pretty quickly cuz we want to

00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,589
give you time for questions hopefully

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,319
this is a very simple understanding of

00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:13,880
what's going on but I want to leave you

00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:16,099
with the fact that changing practices is

00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,279
one thing and changing minds is another

00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:23,119
this is important because your mindset

00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:25,339
is often the blocker to this idea of

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,679
agility you're using scrum and you're

00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:31,130
using Kanban but we're focused on these

00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:34,099
rules scrum and Kanban took those

00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,509
success factors into the process and put

00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:39,109
it in there so you didn't have to think

00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:41,420
about it so that transparency is already

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:43,579
there the discussion and prioritization

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,880
is already there making sure you have a

00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:48,579
shared understanding is already there

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,819
incrementally improving is there and

00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:55,459
scoping out your work is there but if

00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:57,650
the way that these frameworks have

00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,189
defined how to do that doesn't work for

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,859
you

00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:05,029
I'm distributed I can't meet that off in

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:08,269
I'm spread thin I'm gonna say have a

00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:10,309
conversation about it because if there's

00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:14,509
another way for you to get transparency

00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:16,400
without using a board of some type I eat

00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:17,689
I haven't given it much thought but if

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,199
someone has a good idea

00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:22,969
try if you know everything that's going

00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,829
on without asking without pulling your

00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:27,589
hair out and you can still get

00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:28,960
transparency maybe you're gonna go and

00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:31,000
create the next car

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,450
scrum and Kanban for people to use the

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,300
same as priorities maybe one person does

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:40,059
it try something different when the

00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:43,660
scrum principles or that or that when

00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:45,420
the scrum process or the Kanban process

00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,280
that you define doesn't work for you

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,640
take a look at that last step that we

00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,710
talked about inspection think about how

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,680
you can make it easier for you to get

00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,270
that information and try it you don't

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,099
need to compromise the integrity of the

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:03,359
process but you can change how you're

00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:05,770
doing things and the big joke is

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,069
breaking that you didn't do anything

00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:11,619
wrong you actually were agile so on

00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:13,119
Monday everything that kind of

00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:15,970
frustrates you and you think there's

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,369
things that you can do easier as a team

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,440
or as an individual bring it to the

00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:22,900
table communicate it with the people

00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,540
that you're working with and maybe make

00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:30,609
a plan to try it out if this does

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:32,349
resonate with anyone tweet us email us

00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:35,710
and let me know how it worked because

00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:38,349
this is my field and I my goal is never

00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:40,180
to make someone's life difficult my goal

00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:43,869
is to try to make everyone's life easy

00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,730
we're a team and I mean I got to work I

00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:48,760
have I'm not super rich I have to pay my

00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:51,750
bills so might as well have fun and do

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:55,030
something productive in an easier manner

00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:57,280
so that's a thank you for me tell me any

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,650
closing statements and thank you for me

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,480
I hope that everyone got something from

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,900
this note from the folder itself from

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,480
this presentation and I'm happy to see

00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,210
all of you guys here the room is packed

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,950
full so I hope it was a good use of your

00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:19,280
time thank you

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:21,990
[Applause]

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,360
all right now we're gonna have time for

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:26,550
questions or if you want to share some

00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,540
horror stories or lessons learned so

00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,540
first questions

00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:45,870
yikes that is a tough question so the

00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:49,980
question was what are your

00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:51,720
recommendations and experiences for

00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:58,650
practicing scrum without a dedicated

00:40:51,720 --> 00:41:01,110
scrum master hi ed I used to be a scrum

00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:04,890
master and then I left him so what I'm

00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:08,690
gonna tell you is it's very tough to do

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:11,780
this stuff without someone to help you

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:16,410
guide yourself through this process

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:20,640
scrum event essentially is a way to help

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:22,470
teams become self-organizing and it's a

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,900
way for you all to remind yourselves and

00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,460
work together so that scrum master

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,040
really is crucial to teaching those

00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,480
principles you'll get to a point where

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,570
it's comfortable and that scrum master

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,570
is kind of just there to observe while

00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:40,680
everyone's self-organizes but as the

00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:43,470
scrum master goes in all honesty the

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:46,100
habits start going it's like if you have

00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:48,840
a personal trainer at the gym that

00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:52,260
personal trainer is there to train you

00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,140
and remind you but often times when

00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,850
people stop having that personal trainer

00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,520
their practices start diminishing unless

00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,800
they're really really good and if

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,720
they're really really good they've event

00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,620
essentially become the equivalent of a

00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,580
scrum master

00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,730
so the void isn't really there

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:15,030
practicing without a scrum master my

00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:17,100
experience is it's very difficult if you

00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:19,230
have someone to jump in occasionally to

00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,390
continue consulting that's not a

00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,460
long-term engagement they'll be there to

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:27,300
help slow the process of getting back

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,910
into bad habits but when you don't have

00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,470
a scrum master it's very difficult to

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,240
do this stuff because you need someone

00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:36,030
with an objective outside point of view

00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,690
to say fine if we don't want to do that

00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,089
this way

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,400
that's cool this is why we're doing it

00:42:39,089 --> 00:43:21,450
give me a better way to do it let's make

00:42:41,400 --> 00:43:23,579
it easier I recovered until Sept he's

00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,440
saying that the a lot of discipline is

00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,119
needed and the team can do it if they

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,789
really want to and you guys have each

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,170
other so going back to this scrum values

00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:35,849
of the respecting each other of

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,920
committing of having a courage to call

00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:40,170
each other out sometimes this is what is

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,260
missing within the team you guys have a

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,240
meeting and on the back of your head

00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,779
some people think oh this is not what we

00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,779
agreed on

00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,830
all right so we had a valid point raised

00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,690
that some teams have scrum masters and

00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:51,760
it feels like the team feels like they

00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,560
need to report to the scrum master they

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,240
are not doing that for themselves but

00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,330
they will ping just the scrum master hey

00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,880
I'm missing a stand up today just FYI

00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:02,560
nobody else knows will happen right so

00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:44,410
that was the point very very well my

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:46,780
point just to bring back the question

00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:48,760
because not everybody could possibly

00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,520
hear is like what to do if you don't

00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,440
have 100% buying within the team some

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,200
people have are having a better

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,060
understanding what does it mean to apply

00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,680
the agile practices and mindset and

00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,690
other would just do it their way because

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,720
this is faster this is how they were

00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:07,840
doing for years and this was it's

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,660
proving to work for them better my

00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,580
advice would be to try to touch on this

00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,800
point during the retrospective but if

00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,930
that that that doesn't work and we don't

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,840
see improvement for several weeks let's

00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:21,070
say and we were trying to be very gentle

00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,070
it's time to have a one-on-one

00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,110
discussion with the specific person what

00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:27,790
is that we can do to support them and

00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:30,520
this is coming out if you are working

00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,200
with scrum maybe from the scrum master

00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,140
if that person is there

00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:38,950
maybe from the product owners or you can

00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:43,089
meet together with the person that is I

00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:46,000
would say a role model to that engineer

00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:48,190
or tester and they believe in what other

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,400
that other person is doing to show how

00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:53,349
can we do things better together that is

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,369
what I would recommend in this case he

00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:59,380
not be have anything just want to add is

00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,480
sometimes you have to kind of gauge the

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,790
field we like to listen to people that

00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,460
we respect and if someone that you

00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,780
respect or that they sorry they respect

00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,380
it doesn't matter if you respect them or

00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,490
not has the values that you do you might

00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,030
want to bring them into the conversation

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:17,920
because nine times out of ten this is

00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,780
someone that you trust or someone you

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,180
look up to you're gonna hear that

00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:26,940
message much better than someone that

00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,940
you don't give any significance to

00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:43,000
we have a question for what is the

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,410
personal method our favorite method for

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,780
scaling the scrum alright that's a very

00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:54,430
tough question because it's something I

00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:57,540
struggle with every day and inspection

00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:59,800
and adaption is really important here

00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,380
looking at what the lowest common

00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:07,600
denominator of needed information is and

00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:10,450
saying hey all we need is this this and

00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:14,410
this we can teach you how to get these

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:18,430
basic things and then the rest of it

00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:21,370
we're not going to enforce because we're

00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:24,490
not here when you're scaling to tell you

00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:27,070
how to breathe we're here to ask for

00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:31,120
Common Criteria so we're on the same

00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:34,510
page and that's pretty much it so it's a

00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,220
very vague answer but I'll say if this

00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,220
is a real-world question where you're

00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:41,740
looking today go to your organization

00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,930
and say what tools are important for

00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:47,800
them to have from me or from the team

00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:50,920
and then everything else see if it's

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:55,690
really valuable if it's not throw it in

00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:57,760
the trash how I do that that usually the

00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:01,570
scaling will be the most successful if

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,780
it's starting from the bottom up so

00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:06,460
there are people in your team that are

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,590
particularly excited and they want to

00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:12,340
try with the team so they will get them

00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:16,450
buying then you might be feel felt lost

00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:18,340
in the field in red hat was supportive

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,410
of the training as agile practice team

00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,150
so you're always welcome to ping us and

00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,430
tell us what you need if there will be

00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:27,460
enough interested people will be

00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:30,000
providing training on the specific

00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:34,330
topics there are a lot of learnings and

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,610
then comes a time when you probably need

00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,130
the support from your manager and you

00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,870
just go up and then the other team sees

00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,630
while they are doing great we want to be

00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,790
similar and that repeats in the cycle so

00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:47,740
here cross populating basically that

00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,950
will be the most successful strategy

00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,950
there

00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:56,620
we are out of time but we'll be hour

00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,990
I'll be here in a corner so if you have

00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,330
questions feel free to reach out and

00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,610
like I said it if you think about this

00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:06,130
and really want a brainstorm and

00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:08,830
experiment you can ask for our advice

00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:11,380
Twitter and then if you have any success

00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,610
stories please do share thank you for

00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:19,169
coming

00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:19,169
