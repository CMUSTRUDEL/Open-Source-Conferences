Do you need to communicate with DBus in your application? Do you want a quick and easy solution? Are you confused about the DBus specification? Do you make typos in XML? We used to have the same problems with the Anaconda Installer. The development of our DBus support has been very rapid and unpredictable and required a library to make this process as smooth as possible. Dasbus is our own DBus library written in Python 3 as an abstraction layer above GLib. DBus data and objects can be described with decorators and type hints. DBus errors are mapped to exceptions. DBus names are defined by constant objects. DBus proxies are created lazily. Not enough? Extend the library with your own solution!
