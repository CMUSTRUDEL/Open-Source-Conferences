Title: Benchmark Your Cloud-Native Database - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-02-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Josh Berkus, Sagy Volkov

Sure you CAN host a database on Openshift/Kubernetes, but SHOULD you? What kind of performance do you see on various storage configurations? Is it fast, is it slow, or is it something in between?

For the last year, both speakers have been testing PostgreSQL and other databases running in Openshift and Kubernetes clusters in order to see what overhead, throughput and response times are like. They've tested in the cloud and on bare metal, with various benchmarks and storage types including local volumes, cloud storage, and the Rook/Ceph Operator. Find out their findings on where cloud native database hosting shines -- and where it doesn't.

Attendees will learn how to evaluate when Openshift or Kubernetes are an appropriate location for their databases, as well as testing methods and configuration tips for best performance.
