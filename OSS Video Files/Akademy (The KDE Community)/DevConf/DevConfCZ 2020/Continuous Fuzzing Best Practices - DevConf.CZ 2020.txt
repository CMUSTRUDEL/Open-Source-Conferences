Title: Continuous Fuzzing Best Practices - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-02-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Yevgeny Pats

Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing semi-random data as input to test programs. Fuzzing helps with security, stability and performance.
Integrating fuzz testing into the development workflow and CI is a great addition to code quality but also involves new challenges due the special nature of fuzzing.
We will share our experience of running continuous fuzzing for both open-source and close-source C/C++/Golang and Rust projects (systemd between theme). We will discuss challenges, possible solutions and other best-practices in continuous fuzzing.
