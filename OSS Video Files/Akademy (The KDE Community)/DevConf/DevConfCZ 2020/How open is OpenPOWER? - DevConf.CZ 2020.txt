Title: How open is OpenPOWER? - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-04-09
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Daniel HorÃ¡k

With a free and open-source operating system like Fedora and applications it provides, it used to be open since the first instruction executed on the CPU. But things changed in 2019 and now also the instruction set is open and there is an open implementation of a CPU core. Is something still missing? How about the tools to develop a CPU? Can you develop an OpenPOWER system on an OpenPOWER system?

welcome you go give your adult short

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:13,889
talk about how open is open power

00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,550
because yeah the world is more

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:23,580
interesting when there is not only one

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:27,080
computer architecture I am working in

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:33,780
the multi actually went Red Hat our

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:36,719
primary goal is to keep ideally all or

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,110
achieve parity between all architectures

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,230
for all products we support or provided

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,410
today and definitely one of the

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,039
important ones is interesting project

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,370
for interest for Center by distribution

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,440
which is Federer that's my primary job I

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,710
take care about the idea of

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,820
architectures power and mainframe and

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:07,070
the goal of this talk is to at least

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,310
show a bit about how open

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,460
high-performance

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,630
architecture could be because there are

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,880
some changes in the past banks at years

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,920
and things are more interesting I would

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:29,870
say compared to the previous take

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,470
so here is a picture that's somehow

00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:37,369
describes and shows history from the

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:42,500
power PowerPC architectures as you can

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:46,250
see it's a pretty complicated there was

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,670
a branch where the server-side hardware

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,759
was developed it's a power base power

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,119
line there is also the PowerPC line that

00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,759
was more oriented towards embedded

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,750
system or consumer systems and there

00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:08,989
were lots of marriages divergence and

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,280
stuff like that at the end it now and so

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:16,340
with the power

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:20,510
I saw 300 architecture which is here at

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:23,330
the end which is the latest one as you

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:27,769
can see really complex history so there

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:31,250
were some attempts to improve that first

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:37,640
of all so starting the power of Oracle

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:40,690
organization which 2004 it was really

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,209
some some way how to attract more

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:48,560
organizations to join the development

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:52,100
and start cooperating but it was nothing

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,520
really open sense it was still some

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,390
private organization for its members

00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:04,250
things change a lot with interaction of

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:07,850
the foundation that started in 2013 with

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:13,520
IBM Google and video explained maybe

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:16,700
some other companies and they started at

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,850
this organization really to promote the

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:24,640
power architecture across yeah more

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:29,650
businesses more clothes and also I think

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,269
the ideas was to cooperate on the

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,140
business that IBM grow to build a

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:38,690
supercomputer support English government

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,880
big changed oil during the years

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:45,019
definitely more and more organization

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:48,140
joins also individuals enjoying so

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:54,799
really they are now seeing maybe 300

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:59,329
organizations definitely 50 individuals

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:03,290
that joins up the foundation what

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:07,519
happened last year it was really other

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:10,519
major steps it was on the organizational

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,690
side it was joining the linux foundation

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:17,900
to really better cooperate with the ball

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,560
linux ecosystem it was a very exotic

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:26,570
part and technical part was opening

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:31,820
it's architecture itself to the

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:34,200
community so anyone can now take the

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,120
instruction set and do their own

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,560
implementation without worrying about

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:45,570
any buttons and stuff like that so yeah

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:49,230
really it was I would say anticipated by

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:53,190
some of the members some more so in the

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:56,490
previous months and I believe that it's

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,190
a logical step out such architecture can

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:04,710
be developed to more and more open

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:07,729
nature in the sense now we wait more to

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:12,270
show some details on the hardware side

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:15,090
the designs are not open but it's

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,520
Foundation provides some reference

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,710
designs back to members and the

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,889
foundation can use them improve their

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:29,250
change them modified them for their

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:32,070
purposes so that's not open but if you

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,370
are a customer of rapture computing

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,370
systems company that's first talos

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,650
blackberry systems you will get to pull

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,760
schematics at least four for the bosses

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:47,280
10 which is Andy it was indeed in the

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,850
early day so are its ever some box in

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,139
the documentation so it was easy why you

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,139
have to check whether

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,110
pnow it's so in the documentation or

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,919
really grasp on what's in the schematics

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:06,880
and also it's so useful and very some

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,700
damage on the board and you can find

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,100
what components should be on the place

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,780
that are we thinking it's possible to

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,330
prepare out their other open piece in

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,810
the Raptor computing system designs is

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,669
VGA that's used for power sequencing

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,040
there's a power supply so how's the

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:33,570
power supplies providing the power to

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,419
the system is controlled by TGA it's a

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:39,550
small FPGA but it's the source code for

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:44,950
the bitstream is available and also to

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:49,419
vote it's using VGA that's be programmed

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,820
using the fully open to chain so anyone

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:56,100
interested in our very design is one

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:59,410
example and with that where if you buy

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,320
open power system you will get in fact

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,710
two computers so one is used for the

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,040
management part usually it's using

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:14,910
32-bit arm system and then you get the

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:18,130
real our base this time so both of these

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:23,020
computers need something back so for the

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:26,860
management called EMC it's I think

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,650
mostly using the open BMC project but

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,860
also there are some open power based

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,880
hardware designs are using some

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,120
proprietary BMC so really can combine

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,750
what they think is the best also there

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,990
is a project called Bank BMC which

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,840
not a replacement for open BMC but it

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,590
provides sufficient functionality to

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,010
bring up again the Raptor based systems

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:59,770
to the working state and on the other

00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:03,460
side with enterprise IBM hardware they

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:06,640
don't use the BMC now what I think they

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,490
are planning to switch to using

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:14,890
something like DNC with the newer

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:17,169
generations yeah so now we will come to

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:21,450
the phenomena for is a main power

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:26,530
computer there is some schema some boxes

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:30,130
items that describe the steps for the

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:34,510
installation of them mainly the CPU but

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,320
the whole system and we will see and on

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,849
the next slide

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:44,800
all of that is available on github so

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:48,370
it's really start service with power on

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:54,390
action which is initiated by the BMC of

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:59,710
then it jumps to the main power CPU

00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:03,430
which is not only the CPU itself that

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:05,470
you can use for running your operating

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,530
systems and applications but it also

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,640
contains a bunch of smaller embedded

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:18,780
controllers and it's a pin back for all

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:23,170
of them is well partially I think

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,380
internally to IBM but it's all get up

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,560
and enjoy

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:31,760
so contributions from from the community

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,390
so first after powering on the research

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,730
so called

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:40,400
cell routing engine which is one of the

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:42,950
small support controllers it runs

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,240
through some steps so I think its

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,930
primary task is to initialize a single

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:55,220
core once it's this part is done its

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,320
start so another piece of hardware of

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,580
the paradigm which is called host good

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,390
it initializes all the cores the memory

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:09,320
so more pieces on the systems are

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:12,170
working now at the end of stacks or

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,590
loads another piece off in a manner

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:20,510
which is providing kids runtime services

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:25,010
that's also the PCI Express of system

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:28,370
and it loads lyrics with mini

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,710
distribution that serve as the last

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,340
piece of the fear where contains the

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:38,990
bootloader and then you can you can load

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:41,960
your braking system so all of that as I

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,490
mentioned is all on github so it's

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:50,080
impossible to inspect build yourself

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:55,010
modify and so on so there are some other

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:58,580
components which state I mentioned SB

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:01,220
host boot ski boot is it's a runtime

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,270
services layer but it boot is the

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,610
bootloader

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:10,340
it's a exec base so it's booting from

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,980
Linux to some udderly noobs or some

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,050
other system based or

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:20,240
sparkles or you know this mini

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:23,600
distribution called cute OTC is one of

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,490
those more controllers on the big shape

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,320
this one serves for thermal management

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:36,529
frequency scaling and stuff like that

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:40,100
oppa belt Opie built is a projector that

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:44,839
contains all of that and the way how you

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:48,769
will build your own image you will be

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:53,360
nice if all the vendors are building the

00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:55,730
open power base systems would use or

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,510
would marriage they own branches or

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:02,570
extra into the Gaeta upstream is slowly

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,360
opening for the turbine systems so other

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,540
companies or some other are already

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:15,170
doing that themselves saying we have

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:17,149
someone say more difficult to get they

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,720
are changes to the upstream but in

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,720
general

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,149
and that surely if you want an open

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,089
system it would be nice to have some

00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:31,940
open operating system or distribution

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:35,000
so definitely why do they do this chose

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,740
yes these are there and what it should

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,380
be really usable distribution it would

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:48,680
be nice if very minimal Delta do

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,010
something stream or other architectures

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,610
locking like like the x86 so for federal

00:12:52,010 --> 00:13:01,700
is some comparison and we are known with

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:07,990
sync only 600 something binary rpms out

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:14,170
of binary rpm which means we are over

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:18,200
99% complete compared to 36 and

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,940
definitely some important part of the

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:26,270
missing stuff it's really architectural

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:29,149
specific so it makes no sense to figure

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:35,570
out just so by comparing rpm our cozy

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:40,390
Tories now micro boat it's it's

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:44,660
interesting topic that relates closely

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:48,709
to opening the whole architecture you

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:53,950
know organs last year it's soft core

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:58,550
it's written in we implement a subset of

00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:01,660
the instruction set it's gonna do a

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:04,880
floating point yet vector instructions

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,970
also it's missing the supervisor state

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,629
so we cannot run light external

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:15,769
it's all in some stages of development

00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:20,809
so we can be forward to some future

00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:28,209
improvements it can be simulated using

00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:33,079
the JDL to chain or synthetic for PGA's

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:37,819
it's a synthetize Asian part used to be

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:41,179
or for depends on what sure what FPGA is

00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:44,689
you would use for stylings it relies on

00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:50,029
the propriety proprietary tools but for

00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:52,849
some other what is PGA's since I think

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:56,749
used a it's possible to use completely

00:14:52,849 --> 00:15:00,970
open to chain from the source code to

00:14:56,749 --> 00:15:04,249
the EJB stream it's it's elastic

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,559
the slides that so announces of this

00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:10,729
change

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:13,159
so again available get up get several

00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:15,459
generations from from various members in

00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,459
the community

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,930
yeah so dying for some short demo

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:35,610
so sorry Corday so I'm doing it now so

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:41,520
you check out from from media of sources

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:49,020
and if you had the HDL chain available

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:52,870
it will compile it into to simulate it

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:59,050
although at the end sorry so binary

00:15:52,870 --> 00:16:03,550
that's gonna run some more images what's

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:06,670
available with with the sources is for

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:10,030
example micro piping I'm using here and

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:15,100
rebuild one because first it's so fresh

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:18,640
enough and also the cross-compiler to

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,840
change that we have in Federer's doesn't

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:26,410
have the c library so it's not able to

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:29,380
build build a micro pipe in binary

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,560
because it relies on some C library

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,410
stuff so it's in fact it's much easier

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:40,090
to develop on these things on our base

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:43,170
machine with some federer for power

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:47,170
architecture where you are just using

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,390
it's a native to chain and it works out

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,170
of the box so because it's just the

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:56,710
user's takes part and with some switches

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,579
like disabling so hard for point and

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:02,839
vector instructions you

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:05,059
use a regular GCC and things work yes we

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:10,539
are some in the morning

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:14,169
so it can compute it can brain cells and

00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:17,809
okay which the latest development or

00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:20,990
recent development on the micro pipe

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,439
inside so it also allows you to do or as

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,049
that

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:34,059
so when pressing ctrl D restarts

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:35,720
so CPU and because in the more it says

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:39,429
micro button

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,429
it's already started my problem

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,929
it's a start part

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,020
as they sing

00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:01,450
and tones uh symbolically them all and

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:05,770
because you're supported DJ boards is so

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:14,550
sightings once so I hate to use the

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:14,550
proprietary to change but your see and

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:35,510
it's like their house so it's running

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:38,830
the soft core in the PGA it's much

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,830
faster than the simulations

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:49,790
so it and there are some other pieces

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:53,180
that I am under the open for foundation

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:57,700
umbrella opened and it's the open cup

00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:00,260
interface which is it's the open garand

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,650
accelerator process interface so it's

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,520
eye speed or advanced primarily used for

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,760
attaching varios accelerators by you

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,000
waist once so it's used in the

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,340
supercomputers to speed up computation

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,590
but also who can attack sure where I was

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:25,040
PGA Solutions cards so this smooth

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,590
interface and based on the oak pick up

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,010
interface and race a new development and

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:34,880
really new missile help you can attach

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:38,330
memory to CPU and i'm called open memory

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,700
interface Oh am i which will switch from

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:45,260
the traditional parallel memory box and

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:48,800
cereal biggest one and it will use with

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,810
under in the lower layer the open

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,190
company interface there are some

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:59,210
previous versions so to compete Orand

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:03,000
interface and

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:06,270
it's a copy too it's using PCI Express

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,270
or the physical and link layer again use

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:13,950
its you sport attaching accelerators and

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:16,200
again on the Dow is a repository with

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:20,510
some source code

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,960
oh and Barrios PG cards attached

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:30,020
services from this interface oh really

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:35,040
it's lots of open in the whole world so

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:39,900
what's next when we are taking part on

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:43,770
various conferences IBM and is always

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,190
asking the bigger community what to do

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,980
next

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,050
what else would be interesting for the

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,930
community to be opened so whether it

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:55,880
should be some real course some

00:20:51,930 --> 00:21:01,320
verification or development to use maybe

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,210
thanks to some development on the open

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,550
side there might be some open

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,730
power-based locked open maybe five years

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,890
maybe depends whether there will be

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,220
someone who will be interested in that

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:17,370
and would see some business in so if

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,790
there's anyone who would like something

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,790
to be open because something from some

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:26,550
Academical reasons i would like to

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:29,220
inspect how something is being done

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,389
pretty stoked to IBM open power

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,309
foundation and as I know

00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:39,799
interested in all this feedback because

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:43,580
it makes no sense to just dump some tons

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:46,370
of the ATL code implanting something if

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:51,309
no one would be interested in doing a

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:56,720
visit so yeah really useful to have some

00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:59,029
reason why it should be do something

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,590
more with this really do follow some

00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:03,690
development on that back

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,240
not just your it is

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:10,380
[Music]

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:16,460
so from my side some brief overview and

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:16,460
itself time for questions and Lansford

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:36,059
it's a different architecture so having

00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:38,340
other genomes environment is useful in

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:42,360
general because it allows to discover

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,759
boxes software projects that are not

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,159
visible in some other architectures with

00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,919
some example sometimes really are

00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:53,450
finding some real bugs in real

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,929
applications that just because of some

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,120
good luck

00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:01,110
very prescient on for example in town

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,389
and yeah it's also really

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:08,940
high-performance architecture especially

00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:12,840
with all these current current

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,490
interfaces cynthia allows to share the

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,990
memories

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,710
[Music]

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:23,000
see to expect this to explore Google has

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,040
some internal development or internal

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,690
systems I don't think you can certify

00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:33,260
them but they even made them the designs

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:38,559
also publicly available without tomorrow

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:41,330
I as a user versus I think all on get up

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:45,010
schematics is there even the mechanical

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,010
drawings stuff like that

00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:53,659
sorry

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:11,030
yeah it is it's possible to contact for

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,590
example ass and because they are

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,340
somewhere else

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:18,050
the question is but there is possibility

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,970
to get some hope from power our power

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,610
based virtual machine for doing some

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,200
development work yes it's possible they

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,560
are open power hubs across various

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,190
locations

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,620
what is your in Brno and you can ask the

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,230
team good so it's a virtual machine or

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:39,190
even a physical machine and regarding

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,460
jobs there is also some idea having some

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,800
hardware based or more Hardware focused

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,430
LED where various vendors would put the

00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,220
hardware and allowing the community to

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:55,040
do some development testing debugging

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:58,700
for example not only on the basic power

00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,100
hardware but like Nicolas only for

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,210
parents

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,210
