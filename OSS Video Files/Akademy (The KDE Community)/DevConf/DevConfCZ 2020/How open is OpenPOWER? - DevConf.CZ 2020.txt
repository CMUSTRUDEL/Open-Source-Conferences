With a free and open-source operating system like Fedora and applications it provides, it used to be open since the first instruction executed on the CPU. But things changed in 2019 and now also the instruction set is open and there is an open implementation of a CPU core. Is something still missing? How about the tools to develop a CPU? Can you develop an OpenPOWER system on an OpenPOWER system?
