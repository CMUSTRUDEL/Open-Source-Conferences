Title: Reducing cpu jitter for deterministic performance - DevConf.CZ 2020

	Speakers: Joe Mario

Do you rerun your performance tests multiple times because of run-to-run variation?
Are cpu jitter spikes causing your low-latency application to miss important network packets?

Tuning your system for low latency used to be tedious and often error prone. Fortunately the cpu-partitioning tuned profile simplifies that considerably.
And learn how eBPF can help you find where your cpu latencies are coming from.

Come learn what the cpu-partitioning profile is about, how it helps to deliver repeatable performance test results, and see an example where it helped to deliver impressive low-latency results.
