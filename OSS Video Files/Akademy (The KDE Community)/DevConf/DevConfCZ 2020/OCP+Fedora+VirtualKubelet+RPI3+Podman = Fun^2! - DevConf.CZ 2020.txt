Title: OCP+Fedora+VirtualKubelet+RPI3+Podman = Fun^2! - DevConf.CZ 2020

	Speakers: Mangirdas Judeikis

Virtual Kubelet is an open-source Kubernetes kubelet implementation that masquerades as a kubelet for the purposes of connecting Kubernetes to other APIs.
What if we run it on Raspberry Pi, with Podman as container runtime and Fedora ARM as an operating system. And schedule workloads from our Kubernetes cluster?
Small side project in progress, where IoT gets to know Kubernetes or “Connect your fridge to the Kubernetes cluster in the cloud”
