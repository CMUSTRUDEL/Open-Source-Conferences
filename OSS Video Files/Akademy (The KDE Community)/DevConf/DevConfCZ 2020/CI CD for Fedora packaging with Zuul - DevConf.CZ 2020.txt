Title: CI CD for Fedora packaging with Zuul - DevConf.CZ 2020

	Speakers: Fabien Boucher, Matthieu Huin

Me and my team have been working with Zuul as our core CI system for years, and we believe that the innovative features of Zuul such as cross repository testing and artifacts sharing could benefit the Fedora project.

After a proof of concept we showcased at Flock 19, we have continued to implement a simple, customizable workflow for packaging, from the PR proposal on Pagure to the final build on Koji.

A concrete example of such a workflow is: when a is PR open or updated, a job performs a scratch build in Koji, then passes built RPMs to rpmlint, rpminspect, rpmtest jobs. Finally, when the PR is 'approved' and if all jobs succeeded, the PR is merged and a job performs the final build on Koji.

Thanks to Zuul, this workflow is able to handle Build and Runtime RPMs dependencies, allowing a packager to validate easily a chain of dependent changes on Fedora.

In this talk I'll explain how it is implemented and how it could be attached to any distgit repository on src.fedoraproject.org.
