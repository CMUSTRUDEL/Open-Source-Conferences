Title: Applications architecture spanning multiple clouds - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Jaroslaw Stakun

Cloud Native development is driving an innovation renaissance, however many organizations are struggling to transition and adapt to public clouds due to organizational, process and technical capabilities, as well as data privacy constraints.
In this session, we'll discuss how Red Hat has helped its customers with these types of challenges, presenting real-world customer examples of applications architectures which are deployed in multiple clouds or private and cloud data centers and serve users traffic transparently across them. We'll focus on solving major challenges like federated CI/CD for applications deployed in multi cloud or hybrid cloud environments, how to manage multi cloud networking for application traffic ingress and data synchronization. We'll also touch on day 2 operations including application management, monitoring and security.
