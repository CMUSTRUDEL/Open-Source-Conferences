Title: Anaconda Installer - the incubator of projects - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Jiří Konečný

Anaconda is the OS installer for Fedora, CentOS, RHEL and others. As the installer, it has to be able to control and set up most of the system parts. Because of this, Anaconda is getting bigger and bigger, and sometimes a part of the project takes on a life of its own. I would like to go over these projects which happened to start as an Anaconda part. Who knows, maybe even you will find an interesting project you can use in this presentation!
