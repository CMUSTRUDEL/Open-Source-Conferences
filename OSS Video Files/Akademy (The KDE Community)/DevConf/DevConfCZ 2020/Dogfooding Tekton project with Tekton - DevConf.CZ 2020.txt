Title: Dogfooding Tekton project with Tekton - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Vincent Demeester, Chmouel Boudjnah

Tekton is a Kubernetes-native, lightweight, easy to manage CI/CD pipelines engine. Pipeline building blocks can be reused, version controlled and curated in a catalogue that embeds best practices. Tekton, hosted by the CD Foundation, aspires to be the common denominator in CI/CD, modelling what Kubernetes has become in cloud-native application development. The Tekton team wanted to make sure that the project is going in the right direction by “dogfooding” i.e. by using Tekton to run its own automation “plumbing”. The initial continuous integration setup embedded most of the testing pipelines in bash scripts. The speakers replaced this with Tekton, hence improving the readability of the pipelines and the reproducibility of CI runs. Eventually, they moved onto continuously delivering Tekton and its pipelines via Tekton. In this talk, the speakers will tell their experiences about using a cloud-native pipeline system to test, release and continuously deploy itself.

all right thanks everyone coming here

00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,410
I'm going to present about Mario's

00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,259
adventure I'm not going to play video

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,839
games in front of you it all makes sense

00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,780
the title makes sense during the

00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,660
presentation so yes as my name is chanel

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,670
Bushnell I work on the upstream Tecton

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,340
so I work directly on the on the project

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,160
I work mostly on the CLI so been

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,200
developing the CLI and we've been like

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,270
like working on the features making it

00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,519
like everything that's happening in

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,350
pipelines like on the main project we've

00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:38,989
been trained like to make those those

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,670
feature available on the on the airline

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:46,609
and expose it so I'm probably going to

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,409
speak upstream midstream downstream

00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,999
which is probably confusing for other

00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,289
people but what I mean when I say

00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,819
upstream I'm in the tech town open

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,329
project like main project

00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:58,370
midstream is what we do as an engineer

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,079
and where that is that we take that

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,519
product and we validate it on a penci

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,829
making sure it works on open shipped and

00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,449
so maybe I'm going to mention upstream

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,450
midstream and some time and that's

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,430
that's the meaning so what's the agenda

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:14,119
I'm going to tell you about Tecton and

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,060
now there was another presentation just

00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,189
before about Tecton but and me is like

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,229
I'm not going to go into too deep as

00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,640
what are the other penetration done but

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm still going to give you an overview

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,939
at least for the web viewer and to be

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,950
able to know like what is Tecton and how

00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,369
are we did it as well so now it's like

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,100
the men the men the men the main goal of

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:40,630
that conference is to expose you is to

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:44,509
tell you it's like how we doing our own

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:49,100
plumbing which is a CI is an older stud

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:51,670
that's running the the project and and

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,039
what's the problem that we have seen

00:01:51,670 --> 00:02:00,310
coming out of it is that was the process

00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:03,259
and way it's coming and and really

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,390
what's what's going to what are we

00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:08,539
working on and what's going to come in

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,610
in our plumbing in our CI which is like

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,050
using ourselves like Tecton and now so

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,840
what's the feature that the end user as

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,040
well as going to use

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,810
so let me start like with the

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,190
introduction to Tecton and what is

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:27,349
Tecton so first that's the main motto of

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,390
the project is to provide a set of share

00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:32,840
that stutter components for building

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:36,920
community styles the ICD so it's plant

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:41,329
native it's Kuban test native so we so

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,040
we directly plugs into kubernetes and we

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:44,930
directly plug into it

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,209
we are the CR DS system which is the

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,769
resource definition which is an

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,160
extension mechanism inside the

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:54,920
communities like to expose object inside

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,319
a chromatic object for some other thing

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,099
that's not inside inside the communities

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,540
and we are part of the CD Foundation

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:05,239
which is the cloud delivery foundation

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,220
which is with different companies from

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,209
Google rather cloudBees IBM type at all

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,239
and many many more

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:14,269
all right so Tecton energy HL so what

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,900
does dictum it's trivia desktop so

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:20,750
pipeline which mean it's gamal it's a

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,750
bunch of camel you declare the llamo

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:29,090
it's like a decorative pipeline and and

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,940
those those are get picked up by cuba

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,799
rescue some resources just like you can

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,230
create an equivocal some resources is

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,810
what you define you certain type of

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:42,530
objects and you say that I want to

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,739
define like a pipeline definition or

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,690
test definitions and and those get

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,410
picked up by an operator which is like

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:54,500
the web controller and that controller

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,900
would just like doing reaction on events

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:02,810
that's how you extend communities in

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,430
general you so the Tecton when he works

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,190
is like it runs the pipelines in

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,819
containers so everything every steps

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,980
that you do inside the inside Tecton you

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,349
can write like a huge share code but you

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,010
can separate it like to multiple

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,530
containers

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,380
what's what's the advantage compared to

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,820
the Big Shot scrip is that you can reuse

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,650
all the facilities of different

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,590
containers for different type of tasks

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,600
and different type of things

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,550
the small test that is educated and they

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,770
can be shared differently to the others

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,370
so you have like different containers so

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,139
those are our stuff that's coming out of

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,250
Cuba natives which is like the community

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:46,160
style to do that kind of CA so you to

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,870
build images like Tecton doesn't have an

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,730
ambition like to provide like all the

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,750
tools and everything and to be like a

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:57,050
huge math student and it it's leverage

00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:01,220
on other like another building tools

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,760
like a source to image builder Kaneko JJ

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,620
JB JB Jim which is like what java

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,669
application and that's like usually you

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,650
what's going to happen is that you get

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,990
into leverage on those tools to be able

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,030
like to build your your container so we

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,380
don't provide so when you say it Tecton

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,060
is building my container we don't build

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,580
the containers we just launch the tools

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,080
that we leverage and there is different

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,620
way to do that kind of things as well

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,300
and we are we are we are running on

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,370
Tomatoes we are communities native but

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,669
we are deploying we can deploy anywhere

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,400
so it's done and it doesn't have to be

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,020
deploying to communities even if it's

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,510
easier to deploy on it is because you

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,030
are running near UCI but if you want to

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,630
deploy to a OpenStack or to Amazon or to

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,820
whatever then you'll be fine with it and

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,729
we provide like some powerful

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:57,500
command-line tools which I have is

00:05:52,729 --> 00:06:00,320
powerful and that make it easy to like

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,700
list your pipeline create it and choose

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,880
it and kind of thing and it's all very

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,350
interactive and technics and the next

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,560
Raeleen is going to have emoji support

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,970
so so the concept of pipeline so I told

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,720
you like I what's the the general

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,720
overview but when you look at Tecton

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,350
like we have like five main building

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,539
block the first one which is like the

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,960
one that's the bottom of it it's a step

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:32,389
step is just like a little little step

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,030
that's going to it's going to a part of

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:37,669
your pipeline that's going to say I'm

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,340
going to set up my git project or I'm

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,900
going to start to do my go testing or

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,480
maybe

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,520
it's one of the steps after if you look

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,610
at high-level so I'm going from the

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,920
bottom to the top if you go to steps

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:56,050
inside you're going to have like a task

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:58,750
a task like is is what is like it says

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,910
like it's going to like all the CI CD

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,730
tools that you have seen before if that

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,370
task is going to give you an overview

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,440
like like going to list up all the steps

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,810
and how you going to connect it to the

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,000
you come and test caster and a pipeline

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,380
pipeline is a set of tasks so if you

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,060
have like a pipeline of state of attack

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,190
so that your full pipeline that's going

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,090
to do a lot of tasks which going to have

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,200
a lot of steps is that's the high level

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,000
definition on the top I have another

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,490
slide after that's going to give you a

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,690
better overview and you have like pipe

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,450
and resource is by Pronovias which is

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,280
just plug inside pipeline and that's the

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,080
input and output of the task so you can

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,950
have like an input can be like a gate

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,770
before or a pull request can be an input

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,480
as well and the output could be for

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,450
example like a docker registry or a

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,760
container registry or whatever and that

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,290
would would be the output that you're

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,910
going to do so you can plug you can

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,980
define your resources and how are you

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,090
going to do I'm put and put some tasks

00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,650
can have input and output together so

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,500
for example you can have you can have

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,690
like the pull request resource so that's

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,760
one you say that as an input I want to

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,190
have like a pull request from somewhere

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:14,320
so it's going to check out that pull

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,780
request and it lets you like to change

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,500
on the on the on your task you can add a

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,570
comment by specifying like a file inside

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,360
the file system and you say that that

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,210
task that sorry that for that pipeline

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,100
resource it's going to do the output so

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:34,690
it's going to pass back that comment to

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:36,910
the to the to github or to whatever VCS

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,470
using so we have a multiple driver so

00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:41,260
that's that my main point is that you

00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,240
have input and output and after that you

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,610
have like the runners so the road now is

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,380
a pipeline run and test run so you have

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,210
your pipeline definition and you have

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,520
like a bunch of runners with different

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,260
arguments if you wanted so so you can

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,649
have like a pipeline like build my code

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,600
like which is it go

00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:00,439
at a ski that's going to do good testing

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,230
and and as parameters you get into of

00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:05,269
like a git repo whatever get repo but

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,790
part of the runner you're going to have

00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:13,459
like a link to the you to your Whipple

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,379
so it is a little bit more make sense or

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:18,019
whatever is in before is that you have

00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,939
on the top now we're coming we have the

00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:21,589
pipeline which is like the big thing

00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:25,899
that's include part of pipeline you can

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:29,540
have multiple tasks those tasks are

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:31,850
inside the pipeline ordered we have our

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,089
order which call a dag inside thing

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,439
that's going to order the tasks and how

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,509
they're going to run so inside your

00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:40,999
pipeline you can say like I want to run

00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,290
after this and run after this after this

00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:44,779
test so you're going to order the thing

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,610
the way it works like it's not

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,850
complicated at all it's very straight

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,249
forward in a very keys way is that we

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:57,350
create like a foul on the file system

00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:59,179
and and the task there's an eye like

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,730
there's a demon kind of demand for an

00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:03,529
energy point that's going to wait for

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,410
that file to be deleted or to be

00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,170
available and and it's going to run it

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,059
so that's how like the ordering is

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,850
working is like with some kind of file

00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:15,199
locking so it's very simple in a web

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,649
it's very efficient because you don't

00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:20,720
need like any persistent storage or any

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,819
extra demons to runs and everything it

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,740
just everyone is waiting for each other

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:29,809
like using using a using a using a file

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,240
on the file system it's using like empty

00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:34,730
dear kind of volumes to do that kind of

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,790
things so you get like ordering in there

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,529
and you have you have everything that

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,889
goes like that goes there you can

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:45,829
usually you take some runners test burn

00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:48,799
or pipe run run like depend and you can

00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,660
run with different pipeline resources to

00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,160
run your pipeline again again and you

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,249
can you can change you can just compose

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,450
to composite like all your different

00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:02,680
different tasks and different resources

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,430
[Music]

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,379
so so what what do we do and what do we

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,540
provide currently because they start

00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,249
that's happening and new stuff that's

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,350
going to happen but can I please like

00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:16,930
pipeline that's why we call the core

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,600
Tecton city that's what provides like

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,600
the whole shenanigans of building and

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,790
and and listen infinite for what

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,519
whatever the user like configuration is

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,379
it whatever you have another project

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,720
called catalog so catalog is like a

00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,369
shareable test definition so you get

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,110
like a project with a lot of different

00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,629
tasks like for building on Builder for

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,720
bidding on GE bond for for deploying on

00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:44,319
a terrace there for a lot of things like

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,899
that with different one and so people

00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,759
can pick up and those tasks and

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,720
integrate it in that project so there is

00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:55,449
no automatic automatic way to specify

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,119
like a remote task currently or like a

00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:00,670
catalog of tasks but it's something that

00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:03,309
we've been working we've been working in

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,129
designing and this is something that we

00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:07,779
want to have so the CLI which is pretty

00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:10,929
straightforward the thing that are

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,850
actually personally involved it's it's

00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:17,920
what you'd use like to interact usually

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,379
with with the with with Tecton and in a

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,610
CLI way but obviously I mean it's one

00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:24,999
way to implement it though is other

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,649
tools like Jian kinetics is another tool

00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:29,559
that we have with like it's an IO

00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:32,889
Lavelle that does a lot more as well

00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,589
that interact with detect on and it's

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:37,360
it's as well as other tools so it's but

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,720
that's the official way currently on

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,759
tectum and the the most the other

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,670
interesting project is triggers so

00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:48,100
triggers is a project that just came out

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,079
like it 0.2 just came out yesterday so

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,019
it's just pretty when you but what it

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,470
does is like it's going to listen to

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:59,829
HTTP requests and out of the HTTP

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,509
requests you gain to get so a web hook

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,240
for example from github get lab or

00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:06,279
whatever and it's going to have some

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,179
definitions like oh you want to end all

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:13,269
that that that request and how you going

00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:15,309
to are you going to what you're going to

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:16,480
provide as a pipeline one so whenever

00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:19,960
there is a

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,720
pull requests on that people with with

00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,820
that commands or whatever then you can

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,150
have you can have like a new pipeline

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,750
run that's going to run so that's what

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:34,510
the binding between the two we figure

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,800
the tree triggers is very new but it's

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,630
very interesting project and there is a

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,000
lot of work going on like how do you

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,610
going to be it's not just like a github

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,540
web book listener and to be much more

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,480
much more than that

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,100
and the language inside trigger I find

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,660
like really interesting is that the way

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,850
you're doing filtering is like you have

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,860
a purpose more little language called CL

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,480
that's you can where you can do like a

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,090
bunch of conditions and everything is

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,060
inside the inside your definition how

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:04,690
you or you want to end or like the the

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,850
web books and web requests so the apart

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,650
or is another thing that our team in

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,900
reddit has been working on is that it's

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,440
an operator like to easily install the

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,670
tectum and and to upgrade I'm not going

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,730
to talk about web because I'm sure

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,340
you've been hearing about it a lot over

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,440
here and we have a web UI dashboard

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,440
which is a really nice web UI which is

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,110
been worked when you were cleverly

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,300
currently and which going to give you

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,130
like a nice overview and to create your

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,350
pipeline and to run your pipeline and

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,600
everything but there is a lot of people

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,530
who did develop like different you guys

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,300
like openshift

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,610
as well open chip pipelines like we have

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,830
we have our own dashboards a part of the

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,210
open ship console but there's all the

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,970
people that's been doing but that's the

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,830
official way and it's a very it's very

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,110
easy to deploy as well and you just have

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,920
a like to sign kubernetes create and you

00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:00,340
get everything set up so what's Maya's

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,670
plumbing so that's the title of my thing

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,620
so plumbing what's plumbing so paving is

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,300
like as you see the definition this

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,550
which there's a word I can't even

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,040
pronounce it I think John has done but

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,930
it's a plumbing is what you are like in

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,670
a house and what you have like a dog

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,490
makes like all your plumbing and all

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,730
tight stuff together and for us here

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,280
what is mean is like it's all those

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,320
shell scripting and all those really

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,200
setups and all that stuff we have one

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,380
repo we everything all those scripts

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,300
there and that's what makes all the

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,100
projects going on and by editing the

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,850
project and making the release or

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,470
testing the CI we have all the

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,830
configuration as well there so that's

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,030
what we call plumbing we have a shock

00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,860
you billion tests and can achieve use

00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,200
the word test in progress I think

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,570
branding is a bit more a bit more fun

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,680
and we can have Mario on the on the

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,560
slide so that's nice

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,920
so you the initial public so one one

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,800
thing that I didn't mention is that

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,290
Tecton came out of kinetic so connective

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,820
is the server list function list or

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,180
whatever it's called or lambda whatever

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,220
that's project on on Cuba natives and we

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,290
were part of it at the beginning it was

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,510
it used to be called Tecton used to be

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,400
called kinetic build or it became after

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,880
kinetic pipeline there was a bit messy

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,660
but it came out of kinetic and we became

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,370
we began one project and with like part

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,730
of another foundation CDF donation and

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,400
everything so we we graduate we we are

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,830
we are not we are not in can achieve

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,390
anymore when we can interact and we we

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,030
can have an integration between the two

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,230
but it's nothing tied to clinically but

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,390
the problem and other problems like

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,100
since I which m2 kinetic we have a lot

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,050
of those script of religious and

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,640
everything everything was tight to

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,370
kinetics so the main challenge that we

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:56,330
been facing is like is to get away from

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:59,870
kinetic and start to do and start to do

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:02,110
and start to do like radiator on and and

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:07,940
using our own things like with own

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:09,709
knowledge we have we like like one of

00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,000
the things that we've been using a lot

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:15,500
is a pro prowl is the project from

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,640
coming out from Cuba natives I don't

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,089
think I don't know what we are using

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,160
before

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,510
like I've been three years ago but it's

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,220
domain project that's been using by

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:27,740
Cuban natives and and an open shift and

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,180
it's the CI system that that's coming so

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,180
we are very tight and we still very

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,560
tight to it and one of our goal and

00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,870
whatever this carbon is in this

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:40,190
penetration is like how we can untie

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:43,580
yourself from thumb Pro and really doing

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:46,100
Tecton on Tecton and being able to

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,900
- dog food or sell because a lot of the

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,910
stuff that we are doing does it disturb

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,720
that people has been asking us so we are

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,370
trying to get there so that's the

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,430
initial premise Oh Pro yeah I was

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,370
thinking it's a it's it's like it's like

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,050
price is a very interesting the

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,120
interesting project is like yes almost

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,710
everything now because Cuban it is is

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,440
like it's such a huge project and all

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,180
like a lot of a lot of use cases and

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,650
it's it's a bit the same like it's a

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:20,210
native communities could be it is a CI

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:22,790
CD which which other its own which I

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,750
with its own jobs like scold proud jobs

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,490
and it's it's booted but it's really

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,390
written like for optimizing for the

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:36,550
Cuban Indies project need and openshift

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:41,150
as well so we do we do currently using a

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:43,040
we use a pro in some way and we are

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,510
using as well on a midstream like what I

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,700
was talking about like we using a as

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:51,740
well a pro but our goals like like the

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,970
work upstream or midstream or like

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
that's the work we've been doing is to

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,840
move away from that and new route taken

00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,620
and tacked on and to really use

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,870
ourselves for doing LCS so let me

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,700
describe it a bit more of pro and all

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:08,360
the components I think there is another

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:11,330
term going through soon about Pro or

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:15,500
maybe tomorrow but there was earlier yes

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:17,030
sorry it's good to like well so I'm for

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,000
therefore the person like me within here

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,770
like I'm going to explain what's price

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,530
or price like our different components

00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,870
inside it so you get like we're hook

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:31,280
which is like so all those terminology

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:33,410
is is from boating stuff Cuba 90s and

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,450
other stuff so who you get which is a

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,550
thing that's going to end all the github

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,440
web books like the same stuff that we

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,020
have like trigger that I was explaining

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,400
before you add the plank which is going

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,740
to going to go and try to figure out

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,870
like the job execution and life cycles

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,760
like which jobs are going to run with

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,340
job again and are going to run in which

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,860
pods and really control the resources

00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,720
the other resource is you

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,700
the decks so the decks is really the

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,470
dashboard and you get like a full view

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,470
of the recent jobs and the plug-in

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:10,010
elevation and and you can see as a pure

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,260
author or you can see all the the

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,230
history of your of your PRS and when he

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:18,110
started to fellow in didn't I have

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:21,110
another slide which shows you and you

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:24,500
have tied tied is the is the one that's

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,029
going to so you configure tied on pry

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,029
and you're going to say for that PR you

00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,740
need this kind of amount of core we've

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:34,370
URL like one or two deep end of the

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,159
project or three and you need like this

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:41,720
kind of +1 to be able to decide it that

00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:46,220
that that PR is going to be much you got

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,809
like the Rollo John which going to like

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,139
it's basically going to do peyote jobs

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:53,149
when Israeli and you get the sinker

00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:54,740
which is like clean up the old Robbins

00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:56,029
body which is actually really important

00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,299
like if you don't have something that

00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,769
cleans up your your club I mean you

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,289
really run out of problem very easily

00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:06,049
because that's something that I never

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:07,580
taught all the time but it's always like

00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,190
you just end up like which a huge

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,899
namespace with a lot of pipeline a lot

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,730
of things and we have a lot of pipeline

00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:15,230
runs went through so having something

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,570
that's clean up which is something that

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,460
it's it's a really nice but we don't

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,159
have anything that's building inside

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,830
inside tectum now that's a very specific

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,049
to pro so here's the pro dashboard so

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,110
you can see on the pro - boss like

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:32,899
what's what's you've been using you have

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,760
like the deck and the status page and

00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:38,269
you get the mesh requirement and all

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,740
those things like that we get logs as

00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:41,360
well and the logs are you get like some

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,889
kind of highlighting of the so is

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,049
basically like trying to get like

00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:46,429
ragheads of Fattal and arrows and after

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:46,970
is going to say into the context of the

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,860
ten lines

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,750
that's between to explain the failure

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,539
but usually you take the failure out of

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,789
the exit code on a pro with whatever

00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:59,330
exit code that coming if is one over

00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:01,700
over zero then it's like a few jobs so

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,320
that was press or not like we on the

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,720
process like to use or on pipe so the

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,299
like I was the same before so the the

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,340
first steps like to get that to get to

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,330
other independence so we had to create

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,060
our own text

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,310
living and we start to document like all

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,740
our needs of plumbing that's that's what

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,290
we started to do and to start like to UM

00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,390
OCI scripts instead of before we were

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,640
like we were like getting in like all

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,620
the plumbing testing platform can

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,990
achieve all the scripting and stuff so

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,330
now it's like we are on and a lot of it

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,130
is based on the same semantics of what

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,620
what unity does because we're not going

00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,380
to invent everything but it's mostly

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:43,550
tightened more and focused like more on

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,590
tectum CA and and we have as well a B or

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,650
C an image so a lot of the base image

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,420
was before were like on a kinetic like I

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,370
was like based on kinetic on everything

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,080
now it's like we have on GIS with like

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:58,700
only does protect on and not for all the

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,590
creative projects so the the the real is

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,140
the Tecton tech tongs so we started like

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,090
to develop a few tasks those tests we

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,210
made it we made it available on the

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,190
Tecton CD catalogue so those tasks the

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,360
one that's going to build the n test and

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,160
the code or even the coverage it's going

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,320
to use is going to publish image with

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,340
khao sok a you're probably not even

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,930
aware way it does it's a to coming from

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,820
Google from Google which is really nice

00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,980
when you develop when you are developer

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,350
and I when proposition is that it's

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:34,190
going to take a full set of config which

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:37,640
is like a configure for for deploying

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:40,910
your service and I which is a kubernetes

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,730
config and it's going to build your code

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:46,580
like in a very efficient way and after

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,800
is going to deploy it on the is going to

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,700
change like the image references inside

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,980
inside your your template so you can so

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,480
you can reuse those so you can reuse

00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,430
those images directly and we will we we

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,590
generate I will attach ml so what will

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,020
is the Chameli this ml is the is the big

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,960
template file ml file that usually the

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,810
end user is going to use and going to

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,200
equipment s create could use create to

00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:18,920
to start it and we publish wheelies on

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,170
on Google container storage bucket and

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,140
that's what the task is doing and all

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:27,350
those types are available for folders

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,090
we have we we are we are aiming to

00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,320
executable everywhere like to be able

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,539
like to do that kind of thing anywhere

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,049
but the problem is that currently we are

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:39,890
very very tight to the Google the Google

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:42,110
infrastructure and so so a lot a lot of

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,000
these things like running the Iranian

00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,100
air so part of our work is like trying

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,960
to untie to us especially from a mosque

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,289
from the mystery in perspective because

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,289
we don't run GCS so which I like to get

00:24:51,289 --> 00:25:00,049
stuff that's more agnostic to to the GCS

00:24:54,289 --> 00:25:02,120
infrastructure so I'm going to like

00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:04,820
that's a list of what's available on pro

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,649
and what's the comparison to Tecton so

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,500
you get like the hooking which is a

00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:11,360
trigger and does that and we call it

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,059
like interceptor which is like the logic

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,039
thing that's going to end all like

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:19,940
requests you get the job education life

00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:22,190
cycle so that's pipeline for us we get

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,070
the deck which is our dashboard I'm not

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:27,019
sure why it's not in there I'm sorry so

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,570
we get we don't get a merging but that's

00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:32,059
for sure we don't have like a peyote job

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,220
but you can emulate that with kubernetes

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,960
cron jobs and we don't have a garbage

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,120
collection which is really annoying and

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,830
I just end up doing OCD late at all but

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,799
it's not really efficient Oh controller

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:48,740
but anyways like so we started like so

00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,990
to get our way of core of a pro we start

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,279
I'd like to work on the integration and

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:57,320
I how to get the in credit integration

00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:58,519
so so the the the pro pro pro it and

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,870
tacked on works it's like you get a

00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,190
definition from pro and you say that the

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,200
agent is going to be attacked on

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,090
pipeline so we have like a small agent

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,429
that's going to watch for the pawn jobs

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,260
and it's going to run and going to

00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:14,929
generate like the pipelines here these

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,330
the pipeline runs which is going to

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,370
start the pipeline's that the tasks on

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,120
controller so that's how the integration

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:26,120
that we have currently with with pro

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,649
it's it's working so you it's pretty

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
it's pretty straightforward you have

00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:31,100
something that in spirit for wine

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,679
accumulators world because everything is

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,139
watchable with a dart and lifestyle a

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,360
kind of thing then so you just watch for

00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:40,870
the project and you

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,660
adapt it whatever you want to do so we

00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,850
we have some issues with that we have

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,770
the logs that are not integrated so that

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,350
was really odd because the way it does

00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,340
it's not we doing something else and

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,150
they're doing something else so it's not

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,429
very integrated we have like the

00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,799
integration is tied to a very old

00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:03,520
version of Tecton which is depends on

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:05,950
the zero treat one and when they are

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,750
currently need current release is zero

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,890
ten we just came out yesterday as well

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:14,740
and that that's incompatible and and

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:17,650
there is a days there's a complexity

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,419
with Pro which is a which comes out of

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,610
every time you're doing like a really

00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:23,890
large project like communities you need

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,510
a lot of use cases but there is a lot of

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,390
complexity in there that's very harder

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,450
to to figure out for a lot of people

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,880
it's very it's kind of difficult to

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,540
figure so we started like to a get our

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,440
own dogfooding cluster which is a new

00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,990
kubernetes cluster we started to

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,640
experiment and it's time to enter these

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,530
services in there and to be able like to

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:50,500
test those services without disrupting

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:51,880
the others demand infra so we so the

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,350
first thing that was really important

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,610
especially when you do see is to be able

00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:00,280
to do logging so we are on logs we for

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:02,020
for every one that that that login

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,380
component is unfortunately very tied to

00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:08,590
the Google container storage infra which

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,860
is using some kind of login system by

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,679
the name but yeah it's it's it works for

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,720
us because we run on on GCS but it will

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,910
not work for everyone but we are we are

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,080
acknowledging that that issue that we

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,330
need something like that our component

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,340
and we've been working on it and and we

00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:30,370
so like currently we have like all those

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,720
those Rob those jobs that get that gets

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,790
all the containers because that's got

00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,840
another ephemeral so we need to collect

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:40,510
them and we are putting that on a GCS we

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,480
have so we have like product to be able

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,429
like to to start to start with with

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,140
moving away from pro we started to do

00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:51,220
our religious the religious are there to

00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,380
be on on on pectin so we have like

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,080
we have different test tasks for

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,669
different velocity over his type and we

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,179
have a cron job that's going to triggers

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:03,100
for for nightly everything is occurred

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:05,679
like guitars and on everything and we

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,020
have so everything is like every time

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,789
you doing you're doing you're doing like

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,730
a push it's going to deploy to the

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,140
project that thing and and we work by

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:19,929
poor request obviously and everything

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:22,179
yeah so the the the way to do what to do

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,669
to get into CDs so we can do our

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:29,700
continuous deployment inside the inside

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:32,320
tectum we we started like to have one

00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,080
like continuously build images so we

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,440
have like a tool called Mayo which takes

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,460
care of building like all the images all

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,520
the images together we we started like

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,390
to deploy like all the Tecton resources

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,549
with pre and post deploy testing and so

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:56,260
all those all those steps were like

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:59,320
incremental to get to get to our Tecton

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:02,169
services so let me let me try to go

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,340
quickly like over the other the missing

00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,320
the missing pie so there's a lot of

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,100
stuff missing it's very news like as it

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,799
was like we are on is 0 10 0 10 and we

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,610
are the service configurations that's

00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,380
that's missing we have we need to have

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,179
like Shadbolt integration so we don't

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,890
have like those chat BOTS from slacks or

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,740
whatever that to be able like to

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:26,020
interact with with respect on which is

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,390
something that Pro has we don't have

00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:32,860
like any mergers like any final merger

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:34,179
and we have a dashboards but we have a

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,919
Tecton dashboard which is but the

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,250
problem is that in the access control is

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,289
is is open for everyone for action but I

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,730
think there was a PR just two days ago

00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:44,860
like to be able like to have read on any

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,270
form a key input for public access we

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,200
need to have like the test portable

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,150
because the problem is like it's very

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,559
tight to GCS so it's trying for example

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,900
like to build some images and upload it

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,059
on a GCS and currently we are very tight

00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,820
to it so we need to be vendor-neutral

00:30:55,059 --> 00:31:00,610
and we don't have any more to the

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:03,909
monitoring or tracking resources version

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,909
and config so there is other little

00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,190
bolts that

00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:09,080
missing which is a we don't know we

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,460
don't we would not have a way on task to

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,979
say finally so whenever there is a

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,049
failure or success you do eat something

00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:16,729
out of it we don't end all failure as

00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:19,220
well currently but it's been like worked

00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:21,019
on really really heavily currently how

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,940
we want to do that properly we don't

00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:25,549
have like Parham output so you have like

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,799
a param you can specify a parameter as

00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,059
input but you can't say that you're

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,489
going to burn a loop put so whatever

00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:33,289
like you build like a new image and

00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,220
you're going to like you going to deploy

00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,919
a new cluster and you're going to

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,450
generate like a cluster resources and

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,220
you can't specify like a parameter out

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,349
of it so we don't have like an optional

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,389
inputs the inputs are like a computer

00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:47,659
sorry but you can put like some default

00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:49,820
though and you we don't have any

00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:51,679
notification but like we are working on

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,330
this in phase with cloud events we are

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,190
done away to have like remote task which

00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,379
was what I was talking about before but

00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,599
there is like a huge PR and a colleague

00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:03,529
of mine has been working on everything

00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:06,619
on this and we done up hoops which and

00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:09,440
loops which is something that we want

00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:11,330
and or we don't want and so we've been

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,190
working on it I'm a Croatia like whoever

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:17,299
is interested I can join us on the

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:19,609
discussion so you have a demo but it's a

00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,779
video that should take five minutes and

00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:26,779
if you'll be right on time for the end

00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:30,769
of that that I need to find it so that's

00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:32,570
that's a small demo which I'm Alistair

00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:35,299
normally like I would be more like the

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:38,509
Mayo but that would build the bots but

00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:40,489
in that case I'm going to present like a

00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:41,599
use case for Tecton so that was very

00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:44,479
easy to do

00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:48,139
so what-what my M was to do is to be

00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:50,479
able like to edit like like you have

00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:53,859
like a like a web developer that's going

00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:57,859
to need to develop deploy your

00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:59,840
application and and needs to work on it

00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:02,269
so every time you're doing a PR we want

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,580
to have a preview environment runs and

00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:07,399
test that PR and show that PR why does

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:10,220
so the main point is that like that's

00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,590
available I mean a lot of CI CD system

00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,200
has that the main point of that point of

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,929
that thing is that is that it's very

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,800
easy to integrate the deployment because

00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,450
its communities

00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,850
native and because you were using

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,460
communities that whatever like you're

00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,960
doing your CI you you are doing your

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,670
diplomat at some time it's very close to

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,260
each other so it's very easy to

00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,850
implement instead of having like

00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,680
external resources or external plugins

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,960
on everything so wait does like it's

00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:39,590
going to go over and going to do a PR

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,180
and it's awfully going to submit it it's

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:45,710
not awfully because they have it's

00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:47,540
recorded so fully I watch it properly so

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,400
it's going to do a kind of thing and

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,340
after is going to do it's going to use

00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:55,850
the web book system I was talking about

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:59,690
triggers to get notify and create like a

00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:02,420
new POS a new test and and start to test

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:05,300
it and deploy it and build it and they

00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,490
played so so let's see so nice like you

00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,140
just send the PRS and I have a message

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,909
of instance which may occur speaker that

00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:14,540
was supposed to be here but it's only

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,310
here in a slack message so Allah is like

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,020
I'm watching like what's going on so it

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:22,550
just created like a new a new pipeline

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:25,520
pipeline preview URL and he's going to

00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,810
is going to comment it so yes like he's

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,540
just send a comment and you just say

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:34,010
like it's a pending checks and it goes

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:37,010
well so so just just after like me a

00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,510
little bit so now it's like when when

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,550
when he builds it like he started like

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,620
to get you like a link to the UI which

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,450
is like the open chief UI but open she

00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,140
opens shift the tacked on dashboard

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:50,000
works well as well and and I was like

00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,350
it's a it's going so you see like all

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,050
the pipeline and and everything and

00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,940
everything that get built it's like you

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,520
get the CI which is new CI with the

00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,640
emoji and like you can watch with the

00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,160
CLI all the steps that goes on and and

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,430
all the all the buildings so it's

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,890
building the image itself it does the

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,980
imaging and it was a the full building

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:17,930
of the thing and it's going to go into

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:19,880
get it pushed and so that's push and I

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:23,360
was like like you have like the live

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,420
environment that that's newer all is

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,580
going to be to be to be generated that

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,820
new RL will contain the change that's

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:35,180
tied to your PR and we

00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:38,540
should be done so so that's the Dajjal

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:41,450
demo and and yeah my main thing which

00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,650
which are trying to show is that it's

00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,670
very easy to boil it to build those

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:51,140
things inside kubernetes and and whisk

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:54,610
you paint is like deployment and yep I

00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:58,400
think that's mostly it from from my side

00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:02,360
so I don't know how many seconds yeah

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,370
for you in yeah so if you have a so

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,960
that's that's the recap you can read it

00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,580
or you can ask me questions as well

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,680
quickly and I think I'm going to take a

00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,150
few question if I we don't have time I

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,490
mean I'm here going to be on the booth

00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:30,860
and you can you can do if you have any

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:32,120
question yep yep we don't have a we

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,160
don't have any custom resources from

00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,050
kinetic we have clad events which is

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:44,200
like a standard things which is like for

00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:44,200
notifications of a building every day

00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,070
maybe maybe you talk about the API to

00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,290
the API definitions like API versions

00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,940
like a kind of thing

00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:58,250
yeah those case those maybe you're

00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,870
talking about the you know like the

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,380
namespace so you can have like a native

00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:05,540
David slash via 1 alpha 1 but I don't

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,900
believe we using we using directly the

00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,690
the reusing directly the CR this pumpkin

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,820
ativ and going away we are going away

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:20,030
from that again but maybe I miss it and

00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:22,630
in that case of but anyways like our

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,920
goals is definitely to move away from

00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:28,210
Canadia so we're not tight connective so

00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,210
that's the main goal yes

00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:47,319
that's a good question

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:48,819
so we matter oh yes I am so the question

00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:51,819
is like what's the advantage compared

00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:54,369
between proud and an Tecton why would

00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:57,489
you use Tecton against Pro so I was just

00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:59,859
mentioning just before the the

00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:03,190
differences is that is that there is

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:06,609
pride in itself has been been designed

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:09,670
like very in a Cuban it is like for

00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:12,489
communities upstream of OpenShift and to

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,579
be able like to to do to do community so

00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:18,039
it's a it's it gets very heavy and it's

00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,650
not the it's not the user friendly I

00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,959
would say and and it does a lot of

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,779
things like we are we are having like to

00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:28,180
do building blocks for others to plug

00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:30,910
into it and with a nice way when you see

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,709
our yeah Mel's like a very easy with a

00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,660
bunch of steps that's very clever

00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:36,069
when the other ones like handles like a

00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,650
lot of different things a lot of

00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:43,239
configuration and its really like a big

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:46,690
a big big big thing but like a really

00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:48,279
big piece to run and it's really odd

00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:57,819
when you run it to get away from it as

00:38:48,279 --> 00:39:01,599
well that's correct is to execute she is

00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:04,900
on top of astoria to do she is on top of

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:13,799
of communities like in a native Native

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:15,999
communities way so so tacked on itself

00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:18,069
tectonic is lights location like if you

00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,819
see ice can work here witnessing detect

00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:20,859
on itself

00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:23,190
run inside communities so you can't get

00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,359
away but you can deploy anywhere

00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:28,390
anywhere so you can have like a target

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,859
that's something else and that's not you

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:36,390
don't have to deploy inside cube

00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:40,299
entities that was my point before yep is

00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:42,740
the question was is Tecton was staked on

00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:45,740
with managing the artifacts so

00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:49,580
Tecton doesn't have artifacts Malaysia

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,619
or like things that you do you can plug

00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,810
your artifact manager from whatever

00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:56,840
project if you want we do applaud the

00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:58,970
artifacts to GCS directly so to move a

00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:09,770
container storage so you Deb so we don't

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:12,230
provide our own currently so the way to

00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:14,080
do that the way to do that

00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,780
so inside tasks if you want to transform

00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,860
informations between the those tasks the

00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,080
way you're going to do that you're

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:24,020
usually going to use like a PVC so we

00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:26,510
just had like on 0:10 we have a new

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,580
concept called workspace which is a

00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,560
workspace of all your fault that you're

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,260
going to pass through those workspace

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,060
are going to be tight to a PVC but PVC

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,310
is not available everywhere so you can

00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,730
have a small passing information which

00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:43,070
like coffee'd map and that config map

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,780
will act as your storage but obviously

00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,550
if you can have a PVC and you can have a

00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,770
Google Cloud storage as well as a

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,330
resource for the workspace so the closet

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,090
doors were spec the dress that I think

00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:58,850
I'm all the time but I'm available I'm

00:40:53,090 --> 00:41:00,190
here and I'm friendly I think I'm not a

00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:04,050
lot of time ago

00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,050
