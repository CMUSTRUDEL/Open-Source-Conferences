Fedora has been working on a mechanism to gate rawhide packages on test results.
At flock 2019 we presented the first phase of this initiative where only
single-build updates were supported.
Now, both single and multi-builds updates can be gated in bodhi.
So we will take you on a tour of how packages gating works in Fedora, how it
changed since flock, what are the known sour spots in the process and what we
are hoping to do to address them.
If you have found yourself some sour spots, we would also love to hear from you.

Finally, we will conclude on some thoughts for the future of Fedora CI.
