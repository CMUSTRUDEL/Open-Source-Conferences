Title: Implementing Microservices as Kubernetes Operators - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-03
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Lisa Seelye, Naveen Malik

Kubernetes provides a rich framework for developers that enable the creation and management of microservices with relatively little code. By implementing operators as a service [1][2], the developer will benefit from the existing underlying Kubernetes conventions in addition to the highly available elements of the cluster. The resulting service will be accessible via a highly available API, backed by a replicated data store, and have built in user management and authorization. This REST API is capable of implementing all CRUD operations. Audience members will gain a new perspective of operators and their uses.

Key takeaways:
* How using operators provides the benefits of the platform: rbac, HA, DR
* Operators are powerful utilities to help configure administer Openshift
* Using Openshift as an API provides a rich framework to the developer.
