Title: Greenwave: how gating works in Red Hat and Fedora - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-02-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Giulia Naponiello, Lukas Holecek

How can we decide if a software artifact can pass certain
gating points in a software delivery pipeline? We need to make sure
that all tests are satisfied, but doing it manually might introduce
days of delays, which is not ideal today. Greenwave, WaiverDB and
ResultsDB are the key elements in Fedora and Red Hat to automate the
gating process. We're going to show you what they are, how they work,
and why they are fundamental for an automated and efficient release
pipeline.
