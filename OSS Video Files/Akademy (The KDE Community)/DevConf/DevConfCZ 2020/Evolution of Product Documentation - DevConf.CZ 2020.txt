Description: 
	Speakers: Kartikeya Dwivedi, Jaromir Hradilek

Red hat product documentation has undergone a sea change. Actually, the whole universe of product documentation has changed, and evolved,. As an example, for RHEL 8, the documentation team changed pretty much everything about how we produce documentation to improve the customer experience and invite collaboration with people in the field. Learn how we built our documentation from user stories, used Git, AsciiDoc, GitLab, and continuous integration to produce reusable modular documentation, and how you can directly contribute to it or access the latest available content. Lear how with changing times, the documentation has changed too. Also learn how you can help contribute directly and indirectly.
