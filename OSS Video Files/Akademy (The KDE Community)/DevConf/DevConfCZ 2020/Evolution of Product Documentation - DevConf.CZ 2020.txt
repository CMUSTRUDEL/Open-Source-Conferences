Title: Evolution of Product Documentation - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Kartikeya Dwivedi, Jaromir Hradilek

Red hat product documentation has undergone a sea change. Actually, the whole universe of product documentation has changed, and evolved,. As an example, for RHEL 8, the documentation team changed pretty much everything about how we produce documentation to improve the customer experience and invite collaboration with people in the field. Learn how we built our documentation from user stories, used Git, AsciiDoc, GitLab, and continuous integration to produce reusable modular documentation, and how you can directly contribute to it or access the latest available content. Lear how with changing times, the documentation has changed too. Also learn how you can help contribute directly and indirectly.

	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,660
thank you everybody for coming I didn't

00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,220
expect a large audience although I see

00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,530
some people from my team so if you have

00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,059
any questions those who might you expect

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,219
I wouldn't let them your way

00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:14,900
I would like to start by saying a few

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,060
words about myself my name is zeramy

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,279
ugly like I'm one of the managers in

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,730
control services in with red hat since

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,109
2010 and I started as a technical right

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,960
there's a lot of what I'll be talking

00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,480
about is still dear to me and I had a

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
chance to experience part of it myself

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,419
although I've still feel that I'm

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,770
luckier as a manager because I'm

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,600
learning through my talented team were

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,940
much smarter than me I don't have a

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,489
slide for cutting of yourself static

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,300
attractions April 2016 in the same team

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:49,190
and is the bedrock my life

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,750
awesome thank you so I want you to start

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,699
by just qualifying few things about

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,860
documentation if you were listening to

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,539
Martin felt you felt likely or tired of

00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,760
that but I just want to quick quickly

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,199
clarify a few things because the

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,699
documentation is a broad term when

00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,199
people say documentation you'd imagine

00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,560
absolutely anything that is written

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,950
documented with videos audio content

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,750
anything and product the documentation

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,689
teams usually focus on a tiny little

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,259
piece of it I copied this from our

00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:20,479
internal mojo it's our mission and our

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,490
mission is to write documentation that

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,810
helps customers get what they want to

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,850
accomplish

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,469
if you work with Linux there's no

00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,000
detailed documentation there's

00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,590
absolutely no shortage of documentation

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,170
there's so much information everywhere

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,659
else and you are very likely able to

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,149
find information about what you would

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,219
like to do the difficult part is finding

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,049
information that you need to accomplish

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,689
what you want to do with it or figuring

00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:47,060
it out yourself so what we do is we

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,069
write documentation that is targeted and

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,020
customers people who pay for our

00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:53,569
products people who use our products in

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,470
production to achieve something amazing

00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:59,390
on their own we are paid to learn our

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,549
products I don't believe that you can

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,159
write documentation that is targeted to

00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,759
customers without having a clue of what

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,410
you're writing about we communicate with

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,209
other teams because we are not internet

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,579
to contact with our customers so we use

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,890
our teams to figure out what our

00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:17,360
customers are doing with our products so

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,420
that we can then figure out what to

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,250
write about I don't have it on the slide

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,379
but when I have a new hire I usually

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,269
describe a role and hope that I won't

00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:29,299
scare them as we suffer so that nobody

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:31,160
else ever has to again so we figure out

00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:32,780
what is needed and try to compile the

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,079
documentation in a way that makes sense

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,359
and hopefully is easy to read we know

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:45,650
how many of you are tech writers at the

00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:48,260
moment what we don't do we're not

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,790
translators we are not editors and we

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,010
unfortunately don't write manual pages

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,639
but we have a good reason I just think

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,069
that developers are much better at that

00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,840
that's our excuse

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,819
we are also our team is not just

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,250
technical writers we have a whole lot of

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,690
other roles I will not spend too much

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,569
time on this one of them is of course

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,599
Karthik with my boss always fun to

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,310
present in front my boss I want to start

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,319
I would have showed you things how we

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,790
evolved our documentation and I think

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,380
that the important thing is to start not

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,019
necessarily at the very beginning but

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,500
tip a little brief look at the history

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,860
so rather than President X our biggest

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,060
documentation

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,820
still on our portal we had 44 book 46

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,100
books 38 repositories all written in

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:39,650
that book XML which people hate and I

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,480
will point at those 46 books so if you

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,040
look at our documentation this is what

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,680
we traditionally expect if you look at

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,730
our the list of the books I don't think

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,920
that you will notice anything wrong

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,510
because there's the usual installation

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,150
guide system administrator's guide

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,180
networking light security guide and all

00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:00,020
of that in reality when you are doing

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,930
absolutely anything with pretty much any

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,000
piece of software you need to read two

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,200
or more of these books to find all the

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,780
information that helped you accomplish

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,600
what you're trying to accomplish so that

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,250
we were doing terribly there if we zoom

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,040
in and look at one guy

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,750
this is criticizing my content I am

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,769
responsible for this this is my fault

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,450
but we try to focus on customers and we

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,120
thought about things like topic based

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,540
offering and use cases and stuff like

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,340
that

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,550
but we failed because we still focus

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,220
just on individual components so it's if

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,370
you just want to learn about system D

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,110
great about that and you learn

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,400
everything how to use system D in

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,870
isolation chances are you don't need to

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,220
learn whole system D chances are you

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,220
just need two commands that you need to

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,110
run to enable and to start and enable

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,760
the service and forget about the rest so

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,530
we are wasting your time by making you

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,540
navigate our documentation so that you

00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,919
can figure out before you need it in the

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:04,220
first place was those two commands also

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,050
hey the books were big the books are big

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,700
and finding that information is not as

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:13,160
video as it should be I sum it up here

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,040
we have artificial isolated information

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,210
in reality if you want to set up

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,919
absolutely everything my favorite

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,100
example is a web server you need

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,600
installation guide you

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,280
system owner mr. sheean guy to learn

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,560
about how to install that software in

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,620
your to subscriber system install it in

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,840
the in your system how to started you

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,140
need networking guide you need a

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,030
security guide and our documentation is

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,000
not helping you need to figure out what

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,280
you need we also have to wait much

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,840
content and when you look at statistics

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,360
not all of it is read as much as it

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,530
should be

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,300
so we're possibly wasting a lot of time

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,610
it's also very difficult to keep up to

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,470
date I will not go into the book XML

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:57,440
because there may be people in the room

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,910
who actually like it I'm one of them

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,010
but more importantly no matter what I

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,920
think this is what our customers think

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:09,660
and we kept hearing about it over and

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,820
over again so at some point we realized

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,580
oh this is what it feels like this is a

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,820
favorite example so imagine you are a

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,440
pilot of an airplane and all of a sudden

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,590
something happens and your airplane goes

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,190
nose down and you have a few seconds to

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,890
react and somebody tells you oh great so

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,780
this component is this component is one

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,140
book the information is there figure it

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,120
out

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,480
by the time you are out of the shop

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,340
you're dead what do you need is somebody

00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,830
to tell you exactly you are in this

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,800
situation great press this button with

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,650
this pull this and this is it and you

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,180
need to be able to do it quickly that's

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:53,580
what we try to do with our documentation

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,770
and we're not delivering this is a

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,470
little look at who look back even before

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,420
and you will see that we kept repeating

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,130
the same thing we always felt like this

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,570
we are evolving we're adapting we're

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,430
doing something new but what ended up

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,830
happening is that we kept reshuffling

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,980
the information that we begin with and

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,290
never questioned the content this is the

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,010
evolution of one for how it evolved over

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,960
time but if you trace anything in the

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,120
documentation usually it is there

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,729
because it was

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,650
three or even before that and he always

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,050
had it there and it's technically

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,520
accurate so let's updating it for every

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,820
single release that spent so much time

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,820
keeping it up to date this is how we got

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,830
there so for l8 we realized that okay

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,419
mm-hmm and for other products as well I

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,610
would be talking our draw I convinced

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,710
our team majority of people in this room

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,210
they are still but not innocent majority

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,180
of people for my team on in this room

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,100
are working on rel that's what I feel

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,389
comfortable talking about and if I could

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,289
decide something I can point at things

00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:59,810
that I wrote so for rel eight we did it

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:02,750
slightly differently and we realized we

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,389
need to make some changes not only on

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,539
the level of content and how we approach

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:13,340
the content but also how we develop that

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:17,240
content structure books all of that was

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,949
holding us back so one rule that we

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,280
established is all of our documentation

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,680
nope no exceptions are based on user

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,320
stories if it is in row eight means

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,660
because we found a user story somebody

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,639
is using it somebody's doing this I'll

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,849
talk about who uses three is in a second

00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,770
we put everything in one kit for one

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,659
product in one repository so that we

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,279
don't have that artificial separation of

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,890
content and duplication of content

00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,120
across several different books and we

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,700
adopted something called more your

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,890
documentation which means that we write

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,990
small pieces I'll talk about that a

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,770
little bit in detail but we write small

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,350
chunks of information that are used all

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,630
over that can be used all over the place

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,190
so if you're reading a document that you

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,500
know how to establish you know we work

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:08,510
with I'll set up a web server and part

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,779
of that is starting the service and

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,240
enabling it we put the information right

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,190
there is a module that tells you that if

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,440
it involves setting up firewall again

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,330
you get the information in one

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,330
documentation it occurs you from point A

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,270
to finished running web server that you

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,430
can trust because we document a

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,900
supported way and we started writing a

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,000
task you know which is much more

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,980
flexible than the book and

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,960
year to train people it so if you look

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,630
at throw eight title this is the typical

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,690
typo it is based on the user story

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:46,160
it had knows who the target audience is

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:49,070
and a side effect of this is most of it

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,200
is relevant to you if you if you find

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,540
this title before the reason that you

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,670
did struggle the for the purpose that is

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,170
that was affected fulfill most of the

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,310
information should be used before you

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,560
should guide you and effect also most of

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,520
our titles are focused some of them have

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:11,390
less ten pages did about twenty pages I

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,370
took yes I just wanted to also begin

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,370
this service called direct documentation

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,780
feedback to our quarterly you go to some

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,820
documentation and if you have a question

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:27,170
or suggestion you can just right-click

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:29,840
select the type of text and you can tell

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,280
that we are unprepared what your

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,960
documentation I want to talk a little

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,330
bit about it and I hope the mug didn't

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:39,020
talk about that because modular

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:43,430
documentation is something that helped

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:46,220
us pull it off it allows writers to

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,190
focus on small bits of small bits of

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:54,589
information a module is something that

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:57,350
has a clear focus and is it's a logical

00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,690
chunk of information and notices normal

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,670
purpose there are three types of modules

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,970
that we have procedure assembly

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,700
procedure reference and concept modules

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,010
are grouped together and assemblies

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:13,310
complete certain user story to document

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:16,670
a certain user story use the story I

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,750
have a long text here but in a sense

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,020
this is all you need I stole this from

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:25,220
our content strategist user story tells

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,860
us who you are what you are trying to do

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,070
and why and for us that is very

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,130
important because unless we know who you

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,840
are and what you are

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,720
the time to accomplish is very difficult

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,580
to find what to write about we guess a

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,080
lot there are some in documentation we

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,140
just try to look at everything you can

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,120
possibly do with the tool and hope that

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,510
what you're trying to do with it is

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,060
there so user stories everything that is

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,550
in rabaa documentation now means that we

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,010
identified found please feel sorry for

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,490
that and are confident that we are doing

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,650
it right and that those three types of

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,360
modules that I don't want to go into

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,030
detail or that there's a concept mojo

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,740
general information about all the

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,330
background information that you need to

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,240
know to understand what you're reading

00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:15,210
about we don't try to teach you this is

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,760
another big thing about about our old

00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,380
old ways when you look at all of our

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,110
guides four or seven and pretty much

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,640
everything that redhead offers you will

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,040
notice that most of the books have a

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,560
guide in their name because our ultimate

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,170
goal was to take your hand and take you

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,270
with us on the journey and guide you

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,090
safely to what you wanted to accomplish

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,460
and we felt that that miserably because

00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:41,610
mostly when you start reading then you

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,950
realize that we are trying to teach you

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,530
and we assume that you have all the time

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,630
in the world to care about all these

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,400
components and study them and then

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,730
figure out how to make them work

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,950
together in reality that's not the case

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,260
I had myself I'm terrible at reading

00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,610
documentation when I need to set up

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,870
something the last time I need to

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,380
migrate data from my phone

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,090
I of the first article that had those

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,210
three steps I didn't care about anything

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,310
else

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,800
so conceptual module is important but

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,110
when we present it we always think what

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,730
is the minimum that you actually need we

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,230
don't want to teach you about everything

00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,750
that you can't possibly know about this

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,060
no we want it to be relevant to what

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,510
you're about to read it could be with

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,550
enough background but not more not more

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,200
this is an untrusted untranslated slide

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,660
I'm sorry I was doing it at five o'clock

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,670
in the morning and stole it from a

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,529
different presentation but illustration

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,459
of what a concept

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:43,699
module can look like we have procedural

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,949
modules which are pretty much the

00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:49,009
majority of what we have adults are

00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:50,929
supposed to guide you through some

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:54,159
action they require you to do something

00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:57,019
they hope that they you do something

00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,059
they have prerequisites as an explicit

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,559
thing which is a good thing because

00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,599
whenever I read documentation that

00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,489
randomly pulls out things that I should

00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,559
have set up and I did not because nobody

00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:08,839
told me and now I need to find how to do

00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,029
that thing is what I can go back I hate

00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,709
it we tried to be upfront about it if

00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,809
you need some equipment if you need to

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:19,149
pre configure something we should tell

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:21,439
you before you even start procedure and

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,599
then we are very careful about using

00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,669
steps so that you can clearly see if

00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:27,229
this is step one and step two I can see

00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:29,719
that this will take seven steps and I

00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:34,699
can assume whether it will take an hour

00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:39,079
or two days again an example of a

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:41,419
procedural module and the reference

00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,399
modules are those for reference data is

00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:46,789
important reference information is very

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,289
important as well so all those table all

00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,539
those other options that you might need

00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:52,759
things like that we put in reference

00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:55,759
modules there are support to complement

00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,519
complement the documentation that we

00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,839
have been Adamo tools and again to what

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,579
you need this is an example of a

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:07,579
reference what you will and when put

00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:11,509
together and end up with focused clear

00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:14,779
titles and we can reuse many of these

00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:18,529
modules in different contexts well we do

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,249
all of that and get up in a asciidoc it

00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:23,689
has one caveat

00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:25,249
it sounds easy when you think about a

00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,839
small documentation but our

00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:28,729
documentation is not set the last time I

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:34,659
checked we had three thousand something

00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:37,939
like that so a lot of information it's

00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:40,420
good getting in problems that that

00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:42,279
wouldn't be unsolvable without a futures

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,940
we use so we used to get good luck and

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:48,160
continuous integration I will skip this

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,889
slide because I don't have time so get

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,100
you probably know it if not if not what

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:56,019
it allows us for it allows us when

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,970
around we have over 30 writers working

00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,170
on multiple things at the same time the

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,480
last time I checked we were working on

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:05,019
60 different things at one time it would

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,510
be nice

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,269
it wouldn't be never be able to publish

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,130
if we had to do all of that in just a

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,959
file system so we asked it and with

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,310
branches so that everybody can work on

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,010
their happy way and get hopefully

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,949
manages to resolve everything and put it

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,199
together whenever we need to publish

00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:26,740
something it allows us to develop

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,050
nonlinear nonlinear fashion we use

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,690
guitar / good luck so that we can easily

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,329
contribute it has a nice feature that is

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,190
called merge requests which we use to

00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:37,630
keep track of all of our work so the

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,980
number that I mentioned how many things

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,779
we were working on I can look at merge

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,029
request and I see that we have this many

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:45,399
requests open and most of them are in

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,750
working progress so I know that these

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,820
sort of things that people are actually

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,589
working on it also provides a great

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,230
effect user interface so that it can

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:56,310
supplement offering software for people

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,510
who are not as familiar with git and

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,910
this is the one that I want us to pause

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,100
on continuous integration because people

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,929
associate this with development but we

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
successfully use it for documentation

00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,559
there are many things you can do with

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,169
continuous integration but for us one

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,699
important thing is I mentioned many

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,850
times that our modules are used in

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,819
multiple contexts woody I usually want

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,740
to work on module I get to it from one

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,890
particular context I look at

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,839
documentation and see ok this guide this

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,850
information is missing this module is

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,150
the right place to put it in so I need

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:34,419
to update it how do I know that I didn't

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,520
bring anything else so we have

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:39,690
continuous integration set up in a way

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,900
that whenever somebody pushes changes to

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,840
their topic branch that has been

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,570
sequence associated with the continuous

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,840
integration automatically picks it up

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:53,210
validates it and builds premium for all

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,640
titles that use this module and gives

00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,410
you links so that you can always see out

00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,780
oops I wanted to just update

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,600
installation information but I updated

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,610
five different books as well and it

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,620
gives you a chance to look and see if

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,640
that information still works if you

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,770
didn't break anything

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,480
sometimes we break things sometimes you

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,240
use something refer to something that is

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,370
not available in that assembly and the

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,830
belt breaks so again you immediately

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:22,400
have a chance to see that and react

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:27,320
before it ever gets into our main main

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,640
branch additional feature is that these

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,430
previews are available absolutely

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,170
anybody so we very often refer our

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,000
subject matter experts people who reveal

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,340
our documentation people who care about

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,290
our documentation to these so they can

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,670
proactively always see okay so this is

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,380
the latest that you've done did you

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,750
implement my changes my suggestion said

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,170
no and they can engage in conversation

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:50,960
in the comments section or comment on

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:54,320
our code Allah was elaborate more

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,060
smoothly and because they very often use

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,730
give themselves they sometimes push

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,960
their changes to us directly so I rushed

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,880
through this because not when I do this

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,490
in an hour click I didn't rush too fast

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,080
so I want to thank you for your patience

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,850
and bearing with me but instead of

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,520
having this useless slide as much as I

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,080
like looking at my cat I want to leave

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,850
with this slide which is the tired

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,590
recommendation feedback and if you can

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,650
if you don't remember anything that I

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,360
say remember that if you ever happen to

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,880
be our documentation we have this

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,710
enabled and you can give us feedback and

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,510
it is not pointless to give us feedback

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,510
because we take it very seriously

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:44,319
[Applause]

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,680
so we asked our development team to

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,300
implement this for us they knew how to

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,280
do that so they basically look at what

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,540
is different between the master would

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,790
hard to change it very unique to the

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:47,790
French they look at which files changed

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:49,980
and then include yes so you usually

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:53,790
select piece of text and add a comment

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,220
it opens a bar for us it quotes the line

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:59,400
that you commented on and includes your

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,920
comment it also is clickable so that it

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,070
leads us about your comment there which

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,080
is my what I recommend everybody to do

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,780
when this gets to your cue you get this

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,970
assigned react on it click that link we

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,620
trace it back figure out what the

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,040
comment is actually trying to say and

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,630
take a note because it sometimes takes a

00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:25,770
little bit of Investigation to get in

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:29,930
your hat or tu-95 bug there we're trying

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,930
to switch to JIRA workers

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,910
yes the question was if it's a custom

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,530
solution to data documentation feedback

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,360
or it's something that other people can

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,760
use I do believe it's in-house its

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,140
custom for our customer portal and it's

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,929
not deployed unfortunately on all

00:21:53,140 --> 00:22:18,250
products still in pilot mode relevance

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:20,760
important right so I'll try to answer it

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,320
quickly and get to you

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,020
so assembly it's an obscure doc file

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,570
that has it includes and includes all of

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,160
the modules that it needs so um from the

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:38,830
level is relatively simple

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:43,350
it also has it's just an include and

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:46,120
with the relative path to do the modules

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,559
there is additional markup or if you

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,480
want to structured presented in any

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,460
other way there's some introduction for

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:56,910
some iteration to be specific for that

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:59,200
that assembly to your other question

00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,870
this is the thing that we are trying to

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,990
solve our team is working on a technical

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,919
solution for that for now we are careful

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:11,470
about annotating our our of our modules

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,500
we have hierarchy that allows us to be

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,960
could find where it belongs and so if it

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,179
is about networking it up directory for

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,179
that at least we can quickly find it and

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,070
we have to respect naming conventions so

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,980
usually it's

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,730
it's looking for keywords quick grab for

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,600
quick search

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:34,990
so far it works but you're at the edge

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,180
of where this is barely good enough we

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,690
desperately waiting for the tool that

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,690
will help us

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,870
I'm so tempted to let one of my writers

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,040
answer because they build through this

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,570
but they're trying they're not looking

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,420
at me so probably they won't don't want

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,490
that and so this is the private

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,050
investigation part we want to make sure

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,220
that we are not coming up with anything

00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,050
if you think about it you can

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,940
manufacture absolutely anything if you

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,310
put a little effort in back so we

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,280
partnered depending on where the prompt

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:39,200
comes to us sometimes it comes from from

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,510
engineering leads this is a new feature

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,000
this we'd implemented it based on this

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:47,120
kind of request so it's the first group

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,020
for us but usually we try to understand

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,520
ourselves and then ask people who face

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,050
customers support delivery teams so if

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,300
you know it detects consultants people

00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:00,500
who are in the field with customers and

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,170
enquire with them oh is this work use is

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,600
this correct what would you expect

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,840
validate with them it's a reward of

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
effort

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,590
we don't start from the feature of fact

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,080
there is a new feature we ask yourself

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,700
so when would you use it why would you

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,020
use it and try to figure out in which

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,240
contexts and where it belongs in the

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,610
documentation that figure of visuals

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,070
owns multiple user stories something

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,810
that may be used in different context we

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,390
don't limit ourselves to this in this

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,940
feature and this we need to develop

00:25:39,390 --> 00:26:06,140
recommendations of this picture we try

00:25:41,940 --> 00:26:06,140
