Title: Keep Your Secrets Secret - Kerberos in Java - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Josef Cacek

Kerberos is a three-headed dog from Greek mythology and it's also the name of a security protocol developed a few decades ago for authentication. There are for sure other well-established and/or fancy authentication protocols for Single-sign-on nowadays, but Kerberos is still very popular in many companies.

The protocol itself has support in standard Java API. Nevertheless, using the plain Kerberos protocol still leaves a non-trivial part of implementation on application developers.

Don't despair! There is a GSS-API to rescue. And yes, Java has support for it. You can still meet some traps set by sneaky Kerberos dog in front of you, let's discuss them before you fall into them. We will also discuss differences and similarities when compared to TLS.

Attendees will learn how to use GSS-API for authentication and establishing communication with security parameters - such as confidentiality or data integrity.
