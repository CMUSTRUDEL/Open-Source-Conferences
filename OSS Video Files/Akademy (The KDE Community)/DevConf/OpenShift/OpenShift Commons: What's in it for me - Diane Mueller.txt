Description: 
	Just as technology evolves and innovates, the models for open source community engagement must as well. OpenShift Commons brings a new model and new tools for building community engagement and collaboration across the entire eco-system. If you want to find out more how to engage with the OpenShift community, or simply find out how to apply this new model to an Open Source project that you are involved, some to this panel session and meet some of the community manager, some of the members (internal and external to Red Hat), find out how to break down the barriers to community engagement and build vibrant connected communites.

us using openshift origin they're using

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,120
s2 on AWS and in few months they're

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,540
actually going to port all their big

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,529
clients and run openshift 3 on Azure and

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,690
that's going to be a lot of good

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,910
learning that they're going to do and

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,519
contribute back so that when we want to

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,470
as open shift at Red Hat want to do the

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
same thing we won't be a first ones

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,080
there so there's some really good things

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,719
so there's hosts and operators there's

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,390
everybody who's ever built the cartridge

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:42,600
for their service everyone who's created

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,760
da perimeter folks like MongoDB all of

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,129
these other companies out there that are

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,800
providing services that run or integrate

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,600
into open ship I consider them part of

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,300
my community because there's that all

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,770
the hooks that they need to know we

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,660
don't want to be reinventing that meal

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,949
every single time and so I'm really

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,530
trying to do is start to create a bigger

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:07,020
idea about what community is from the

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,020
open shift point of view the other piece

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,360
of the puzzle is is that open shift up

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,270
streams as you heard in the last block

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,680
Cooper Nettie's it upstream is darker so

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,200
we're very dependent on those

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,689
communities as well so instead of like

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,540
trying to steal resources from the

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,870
Cooper Nettie's group what we've done is

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,270
sort of flipped at all on its head

00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,390
our engineering resources like Clayton

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,160
and Fitz bats and other people into

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,010
those projects so that we get the

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,730
features that we need in those projects

00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,430
so our community isn't just the people

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,160
working on open ship itself and

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,450
contributing code to the flash storage

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,890
and github repo it is a very big vibrant

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,810
community so when I talk about openshift

00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,740
Commons you notice I'm not using the

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:03,200
word foundation or some other metaphor

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,380
for a group of people working together

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,170
on the single project it's a new

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,160
community model in sense that instead of

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,320
focusing in on just code contributors

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,870
we're trying to open and extend the

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,090
umbrella so that everyone that is

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,260
working and contributing to that as part

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,480
of that that process and what we are the

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,320
reason we started doing this you've all

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,750
heard about how we shifted from v2 to v3

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,480
when the v3 started coming out we had

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,420
have these conversations multiple talk

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,660
we were repeating ourselves and you may

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,190
have met some of the evangelists for the

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,920
open shift team there were at the time

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,380
four of us or five of us we couldn't

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,780
scale ourselves it wasn't about scaling

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,540
containers it was we couldn't get enough

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,209
people and product managers to talk in

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,280
all of one-on-one conversations we

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,760
needed to figure out a way to change the

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,560
communication model because we needed

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,260
everybody to be talking to each other

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,830
not just talking to red hat and we had a

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,019
fire hose in order fire hoses like open

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,840
the hydrant and it just blows up

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,910
everything changed containers change the

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,150
language underneath let's go the

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,239
architecture was

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,860
Eddie's 8am we were no longer anyone who

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,379
had a cartridge was going to have to

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,720
create a daughter age there was a lot of

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,700
learning that had to go on and we

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,459
couldn't do it ourselves so we had to

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,280
get a way to get all the peers talking

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,280
to each other back and forth and what

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,470
we've done is try and create a virtual

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,470
hug that opened that commons on

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:48,180
openshift org we have mailing lists and

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,349
cigs of special interest groups so

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,359
there's lots of different ways that

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,810
tears interact with each other so

00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:57,329
operators talk to operators some of the

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,310
folks who are working on best practices

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,609
around DevOps have conversations and

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,180
you'll see I host a lot of podcasts and

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:09,420
video conference calls and it's pretty

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,579
amazing the number of people so who's in

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,709
there today all of the enterprise

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,049
customers should be in there if you're

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,630
an enterprise customer using openshift

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,419
enterprise it's time to get your feet

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,900
wet and become little open sourcing and

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,180
start talking to your peers sometimes we

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,650
have a little difficulty with getting

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,479
permission from like large government

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,940
agencies so we we make amends for that

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,370
but this is when one of the key tenets

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,860
of this group is we really like people

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,780
to identify who they are so like in some

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,180
mailing lists everybody will be a gmail

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,460
address or it'll be some sort of

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,909
anonymous thing we are really trying to

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,060
push people to join and identify who

00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:56,389
they are so they can find their family

00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,240
and their cigs and they know each other

00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,639
so there will be some people some of the

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,320
US government agents because I maybe I'm

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,340
an American living in canada here in the

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,820
check but some of them like NASA joined

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,250
openshift Commons but others have to

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,960
rename nameless but that you'll see if

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,080
you're on the mailing list they are

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,539
allowed to use their actual corporate or

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,130
government email so we've been pretty

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,750
good there's a lot of service providers

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,910
people

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:30,830
we're doing cartridges before people

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:33,050
providing integrations and api's that

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,300
work with openshift folks who are

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,350
running their own clouds like Cisco

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Radel or get a problem I mentioned there

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,310
are the wonderful thing about working an

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,230
open source is every conference you go

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,940
to you meet someone else who's

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,120
downloaded your open source code and

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,160
deploy it they didn't know about and a

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
few months ago I was in Tokyo at the

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,169
OpenStack summit and I was really

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,470
frustrated because I've only got one

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,180
talk except usually they have room and

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,580
they had like three thousand people in

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,250
the call for papers so they really had

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,470
to call out and anyone who'd ever really

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,990
talked a lot before didn't get a

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,690
speaking slot so I only got one very

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,240
short one and then at the same time as

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,030
my talk was going on unbeknownst to me

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,600
was a company small company called

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,770
semantic gave up talk and they were

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,570
ranking they were going through

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,520
reviewing all the platforms of the

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,570
services that are out there and I was a

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,250
little worried because I didn't know

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,530
these people right I didn't know who

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,510
they were I was I wasn't going to get to

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,270
go sit in the top because I was giving

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,100
my talk at the same time and I came out

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,800
of it and everybody came to the booth

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,810
afterwards said hi you know you should

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,020
have been there where were you they were

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,530
just raving about an open shift and they

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,660
had downloaded over to the origin

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,490
totally anonymously I hadn't white here

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,030
and deployed it and they were using in

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,950
production so that's kind of boy oh man

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,229
that sort of bent about people

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:06,650
identifying who they are so that we can

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:08,270
connect who's IRC is tends to be kind of

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,680
anonymous and the mailing lists tend to

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,630
be kind of knots or trying to bring

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,640
people out of their shells so that

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,090
different groups can do it and all the

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,010
enterprise customers are there so at the

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,650
moment we have a hundred and seventy

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,390
five different organizations that are

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,710
part of the opens you've com that's

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,470
actually

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:31,740
you know 35 contributing companies is

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,949
nice but for us when you you look at

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:38,160
what company will stand up and say and

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,320
give feedback and participate design and

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,539
the processes around building out

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,460
something like urban ship to have a

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:48,289
hundred and seventy-five organizations

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,460
is huge how does that sort of break out

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:53,190
they hundred seventy five organizations

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,160
of that from any time an organization

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,830
joins as many people from that company

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,410
that want to can it can come in and be

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,789
part of the affair so if your company

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:08,009
XYZ and you have 20 subsidiaries just

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:10,650
joined once and all of those folks can

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,509
come so we have a rather active mailing

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,750
list where people are talking to each

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,949
other and coming to the briefings and

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,050
these briefings I'm going to talk a

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,669
little bit more about a minute but like

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,560
a couple of the companies of just joined

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,860
this week is three scale and impulses

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,470
and we've works so we on average we have

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,510
about two or three new companies popping

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,520
up identifying that they're using or

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,830
integrating with open shift and joining

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,560
the comments it's a pretty huge

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,940
community that were part of so when I

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,430
come to a conference like this and I say

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,800
I should know every one of you it's next

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,570
to impossible but what I really want is

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,540
for every one of you two know each other

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,610
not just me don't just red hat so we can

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,400
sell you stuff we want you talking to

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,240
each other across the community and we

00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:02,070
do talk a lot I know I do talk a lot so

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,779
there's the 35 there so how do we get

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,779
that kind of engagement going and that's

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,100
really the big chore that I have not

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,440
sure it's actually what I really like

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,320
doing the mailing lists is really the

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,870
key way that people can find each other

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,839
we also on our website have a list of

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,060
participating organizations I tend to be

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,170
myself as the community manager if

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,850
someone wants the new

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,950
to someone else at another company I'm

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,240
tend to be the linchpin for that

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,980
probably the block for that so we

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,560
haven't quite figured out a way to

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,010
automate that so someone says XY said I

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,350
don't want to reinvent linkedin we are

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,630
starting special interest groups so if

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,260
you're an operator or educator or

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,060
government person telco and I think

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,190
there's going to be a networking one

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,730
Oregon that I'm going to openstack one

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,170
coming soon you can get on a mailing

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,079
list for that and talk amongst

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,440
yourselves and more host we posted a

00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,240
weekly IRC meeting every Thursday that

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,649
people can come in and ask questions and

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,570
in those IRC sessions we give updates

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,060
from the different upstream projects so

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,100
maybe one will get an update on Cooper

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,470
Nettie's what's going on there where the

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,029
roadblocks are there on docker where the

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,070
roadblocks are there what's going on

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,480
what the new features are or some new

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,449
feature so that happens in the IRC

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,790
channels and then there's the commons

00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:27,420
briefings and what that is is an

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:31,500
opportunity for members non redhat ones

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,140
people with services to showcase their

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,899
beta integrations so some people have

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,130
new tools that they want feedback on so

00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,500
they'll give a presentation and

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,240
demonstration and you're something

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,490
they're passionate about or something

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,360
that doesn't work so we end up with

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,790
trying to do one of those every week is

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,060
sort of my goal I do travel a lot so it

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,589
ended up being about every other week so

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,079
if there's something there's a topic

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,839
that you want to hear more about like

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,000
mike barrett just did that great what

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,949
the future is but if there's one chunk

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,440
of that that someone's done interested

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,089
in there's a whole slew of briefings

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,400
that have been recorded from last year

00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,650
that are great

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,170
operation of commons at openshift org

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,270
site under the briefings page and you go

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,430
to the bottom of that is ton of them and

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,230
they are actually really good it's not

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,210
all me talking I just introduced people

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,190
make them talk about their passionate

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,990
thing or feature that they're working on

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,940
and then there's a Q&A session

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,940
afterwards so if you're watching it

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,580
listen through or slide the YouTube

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,040
slide to the end of near the end you'll

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,760
hear your questions and yesterday we did

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,130
one mar clamoring did a talk about

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,680
running openshift on OpenStack using

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,470
some of the OpenStack resources rather

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,570
than just running openshift on top and

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,000
ignoring the fact that there's sender

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,770
and other things you can use directly it

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,390
was actually pretty good in the

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,550
conversation after which was probably

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,410
even more interesting than the

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:05,030
presentation the presentation was really

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:07,220
good too so the things we're doing with

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,520
the upstream community I mentioned um

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,010
Microsoft Azure get up cloud is going to

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,020
launch supposedly in early June I know

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,150
they're already moving their first big

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,050
clients over to that and doing some

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,880
testing we're working with Azure to get

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,400
support for running dotnet containers

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,440
that's coming out sometimes in the

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,060
future too so you'll probably see a

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,180
common briefing on that when it gets

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,470
ready and we're making sure that we have

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,329
pageants we want to make sure that we

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,350
run on any platform the open shift

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:43,940
dedicated but managed hosted version of

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:47,100
open shift are not that is running on

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:51,389
with using open shift three will be

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,010
running on gcp and open shift online v2

00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:56,519
the stuff that using now is running on

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,050
AWS you can run it on bare metal too and

00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm VMware and lots of other things but

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,970
we're really trying hard to make sure

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,680
that the interoperability and it's

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,709
pretty seamless between the different

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,500
infrastructures that you can run clear

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:13,980
at ease I on I like to say that open

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,139
shift three is the best route to having

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,510
an enterprise production-ready

00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,760
deployment of Coober Nettie's because

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,070
when you deploy an open shift you get

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,899
open shift three and you also get

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,279
through Nettie so depending on which way

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,670
you want to give you still use Cuban

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,100
Eddie's directly or you can use the open

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,410
shegaon room so it's and I think they've

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,680
done a very good job of making those

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,990
Hansel play hooks and working with heat

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:45,300
to make it very simple to deploy

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,730
anywhere and even on OpenStack so as I

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,350
mentioned earlier we do we have embedded

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,930
resources into the kubrick Eddie's

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:55,529
project they've done work on ours if you

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,370
remember a side piece of gear d actually

00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,930
ended up moving over from open shift and

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,010
reincarnating over

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:06,980
grenades we will be asked in force at

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:10,310
the Kubek on events that are upcoming in

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,620
March stairs could be gone in London you

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,630
one in North America they'll also be

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,180
another one there and you will see lots

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,010
of red hats and lots of open shift

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,640
people there because we really are

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:25,250
working in tandem with Google and making

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,870
that work so there are tons of atomic

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,390
presentations here I'm not going to go

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,450
too deep dive or talk too much but there

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,660
but basically we upstream atomic into

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,730
open shift so we do a lot of make sure

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,720
everything all the pieces and parts are

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,580
there and we're really trying to embrace

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,620
atomic and help other people understand

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,580
it better so you'll see in the Commons

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,170
breathing I think for atomic related

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,220
talks that are recorded and there'll be

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,050
number more coming up then doctor we've

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,120
also been some bats is running around

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,279
here at the conference you've taken

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,040
resources from Red Hat engineering and

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,200
put it into the doctor project Dan Walsh

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,320
has done a ton of work around securing

00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,880
docker containers and we're working on

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,730
getting some of the patches that we've

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,680
requested merged into docker as well so

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,610
there's a lot of conversation that goes

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,640
on between all of these communities

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,020
let's see so I've talked a lot about

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,660
commons briefing some of the upcoming

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:30,310
things see we just did the open shift

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,170
three on OpenStack we're here at Def Con

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,600
there's a service linking and service

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,880
catalogues thing that's coming up and

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,190
then the identity management one that's

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,579
coming up in February 25th is actually

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,890
quite interesting open unison is a

00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:49,740
recently open source project from

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:53,880
tramelo security security

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,840
theory that helps is that they're

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,760
they're going to present their

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,460
integration and it's used in a lot of

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,100
large US government agencies to do

00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,440
identity management so that's an injury

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,810
that sort of what i'm trying to do this

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,990
year is to get at least fifty percent of

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,840
the talks given by non Red Hat community

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,740
people so if you are not a red header

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,180
and there's something that you're

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,340
passionate about or there's a side

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,470
project you want to talk about it or get

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,690
feedback on because one of the wonderful

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,540
thing about these talks is that it's a

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,350
great feedback mechanisms we had a

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,290
fellow come on mid-year last year and he

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,180
had written just this alpha version of a

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,400
monitoring tool for dr. containers

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,950
inside of communities and the whole

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,620
conversation after his presentation

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,780
great demo helped and really figure out

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,000
what was necessary to go to the next

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,920
level so this is the kind of interaction

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,080
that we're really trying to get is to

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,010
have those conversations about use cases

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,330
and best practices for open ship and not

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,870
necessarily just about over chick and

00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,020
then sometime in April the getup Club

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,820
guys are going to come and talk about

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,500
running and deploy the test give us an

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,850
update on their work getting open shift

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,580
running on Azure and that should be

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:13,280
really very interesting very cool bunch

00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:16,680
of folks from down and up down in Brazil

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,150
so I mentioned Kubek on any of you guys

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,500
going to kabhi gham one okay well you're

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:28,170
with right at good i'll make you work in

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,270
the booth hey so they're supposedly

00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,840
going there tenant leaves saying the

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,510
north

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,070
everyone will be in CL at each of those

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,440
events we will have an open shift

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,960
Commons meetup where what we're going to

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,630
do is every one of Commons members who

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,010
are there it's kind of a social thing

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,720
kind of like we drink some beer we'll

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,640
talk about the beer then we'll talk

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,190
about what they're doing with 0 pitch in

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,309
where their roadblocks are what sidecar

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:57,919
things that they need us to do and more

00:17:53,309 --> 00:18:01,080
of a push to get the conversation going

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,169
they'll be a panel on how to contribute

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,380
to coop Cuban Eddie's and origin on the

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:10,880
main stage at the concert and it will

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,169
just be me talking maybe other folks to

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,899
get rid that summit there's going to be

00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:17,730
Commons panels will be meetups and we're

00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:21,120
going to have a whole track a virtual

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,039
track of following all the different

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,409
people and partners throughout from the

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,779
comments throughout the right hat event

00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:29,820
the calendar events which I will show

00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,789
you in a minute to which is on the

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,510
readings will always keep keep you

00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:38,429
up-to-date but if you join the commons

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:41,789
mailing lists which is at our main

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:44,039
homepage for comment openshift org you

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,510
can stay up to date and anyone from

00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,549
right hi guys welcome to so if you're

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,669
not already on it just put it in there

00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,500
and it's semi-automated you have to wait

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,170
for my

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,060
don't catch up and i will add you into

00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:00,530
the mailing lists and get you on the

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,900
announce list for that and we are going

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,220
to post a CFP we're going to host

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,890
something called the open shift

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,500
gathering we do everything virtually

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,900
because as you all know open shift is

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,710
pretty global you saw from the winner of

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,710
code there was France and Japan the

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:22,160
other was Slovakia one so it was like

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,050
this huge range of people and I live in

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,760
Vancouver in Canada so I'm on the west

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,700
coast so trying to keep up with all

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,570
these things we'd have to be virtual but

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,690
we are committing to having an actual

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:38,060
physical get together sometime and it's

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,390
going to be on the unit right after the

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,700
Kubek on in August is what we're pushing

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,760
for so we'll have two days and what

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,510
we're going to do is to have Ted tiles

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,360
ted ted talks head style hop heads

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:56,900
anyways ted talks from people in

00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:01,700
different columns user groups and

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,290
different parts of projects and then for

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,160
the first day and running a good view

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,990
did I mention beer look a good beer

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,780
because it's in Seattle we're going to

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,420
bring micro version we're going to do a

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,670
session there a workshop on contributor

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,650
training because I think as I've had to

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,110
set up your environment so that you can

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,690
do testing locally and contribute code

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,480
any that's one of the things because we

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,670
should become such a complex application

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,590
that it's really good so if you need to

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,510
justify to your company while you're

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,780
coming that's been and there'll be a

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,220
number of hands-on workshops a lot of

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,170
you might have heard of the road shows

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,750
that we did over the past year to get

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,510
people to speed on openshift free it's

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,840
going to be kind of like that but more

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,280
hands-on mostly in the middle you know

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,500
slide projectors showing things like

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,990
what you're seeing right now so that's

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,110
really what we're trying to do is keep

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,540
it its virtual as possible keep all

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,450
those peer-to-peer connections

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:05,540
connecting try and get red hat out of

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,880
the way so a lot of times as i seem to

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,160
be that the connector point for a lot of

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,080
introducing people but also we're trying

00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,290
to make it so that we're not the only

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,770
ones time so i've been talking for a bit

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:22,130
but um that's really the commons

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:24,860
gatherings 216 you will see that's a

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,350
web-sight come up i encourage you to

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,870
mount join the mailing list you'll see

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,880
twitter tweets up from me from the

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,250
overshift commons and the open shifts

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,440
twitter accounts you'll see it post

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,650
posted on probably up the IRC when the

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,310
cfp comes out for the gathering and you

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,630

Hat page for all of you

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,760
that would be awesome to Seattle's a

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,620
wonderful place but we haven't got an

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,420
official date yet because Kubek on

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,820
hasn't you can get an official date for

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,700
North America but that will be there'll

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,680
be a call for paper and submissions and

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,000
hopefully we will find some funds to

00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,640
subsidize on the trail travel but all

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,350
right this is how you're going to get

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,450
notification of all this please go in

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:17,780
and join and end up on valueless I will

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,550
not stalk you I will not try and sell

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,470
you anything i'm on the open source side

00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,980
of things I'm an Origin I'm not going to

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,950
try it up to you to open enterprise or

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,760
dedicated but you will get down to it

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,170
when you Developer Preview comes out i

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,000
will let let you guys in on whenever

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,340
that it is and where the four minutes to

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,690
sign up and we'll get you on board and

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,390
you'll hear all the new release

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:45,860
announcements coming out through this

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:48,110
mailing list so that's what i had to

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,520
share and i'm going to have to give this

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,640
as a lightning talk later so I'm going

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,060
to do the same thing even faster in a

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,950
little bit but so the so the real crux

00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:02,150
of it is this open ship columns is

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:04,660
really about you meeting each other in a

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,460
virtual second language place and

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,800
sharing your information with each other

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,020
rather than waiting for red hat to give

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,850
it to you and spoon feed it to you there

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,800
are a lot of red hat presentations there

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,010
on the briefing site I'll prank I'll

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,230
pull that up for a minute while I'm

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,970
doing that um oops and I think that's

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:29,360
the other thing how many do you use

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:34,880
slack yeah how many of you love slack no

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:37,640
yeah all right so I was going to UM do a

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,310
slack channel but that I'm not feeling

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,050
the love here I'm i really like IRC so

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:48,590
I'm kind of there in that so I thinking

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:53,090
nicely so the common site is right here

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,039
and let's see if if you want to join the

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,400
mailing list but the one thing that I'd

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:01,370
really like you to do today is go in and

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm not going to star me with star this

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,340
this repo and pay attention to this repo

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,650
and like it for me and I'm hoping that

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,350

sales team that's there because they're

00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:13,239
the one I don't nothing goes wrong then

00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,239
we can get that done

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:20,919
cloud specialist are you we have been

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,919
why you go to fight

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:27,400
well I used to work on the founder yeah

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,440
i work for active state before i came i

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,850
worked on staccato so i know all the

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,980
cloud foundry stuff I know where that I

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,940
know where the scalp comes our yeah so

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,220
it's and they have what's wonderful

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,400
about Cloud Foundry is they have really

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,650
good services are right the labs that

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,210
they do they're more about providing

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,130
consulting services than they are about

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,230
software and teaching people how to be

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,120
agile and all that and we're more of us

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,220
we're making sure the software scales

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,950
and works and stuff so it's sometimes

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,560
it's apples oranges so we got people

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,850
they got them well because their consent

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,500
if you're going to have a consultancy

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,840
you have to have a lot of people because

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,850
it's the only way of scales so and so

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,160
they're all over the place and they know

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,770
right in your face quite a bit yeah

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,960
exactly we can work on that we can work

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,720
a lot of Kabul all right so make sure

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,820
you're longing to know me and remind me

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,040
and we'll set because i'm in vancouver

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,100
bc supplying the bank of the west coast

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,050
of china is not that bad as we don't be

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,000
added a new quest yeah and now I've been

00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,280
to Bangalore and over there a couple of

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,040
times of people so it's you know we

00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:36,270
could do a tour what I'd like to do is

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,890
find the commons members who are there

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,850
have them come and present rather than

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,850
me talk and and have a have a community

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:52,190
leader yeah we need to make

00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:55,220
some-some is there before we can do that

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:59,970
I've noticed quite some like postures or

00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,940
just astex in the RC channel open shift

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:06,240
in China time zone but this probably

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:08,120
asleep yeah so what we need to do is

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,380
start figuring out who those people are

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,120
inviting them into the commons getting

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,490
them to join so that they identify

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,410
themselves and their companies so that

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,420
we can connect and that's what the

00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,930
commons is really about connect them to

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:24,530
each other into a red hat and hopefully

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:27,450
we can grow a community there and

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:31,440
because as I said where we don't have

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,900
the budget for and we can't we can't

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,940
