Description: 
	Windup is a tool for enterprise application migration - from one platform to another (ideally a Red Hat one:o)), from older version to a newer.

The existing platform-independent rules are focused on migration to JBoss EAP 6+, but you can use it for other purposes as Windup is a generic rule-based pluggable platform.

This talk summarizes what's the current state of the project and what is planned in the near future. It also explains some interesting technical aspects such as how we deal with large sets of loosely structured data or how the rules are evaluated.
