	00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:07,410
with Lincoln Baxter the the founder of

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,710
the forged project to do the integration

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:15,450
of forge one in those days with jboss

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,090
tools but the things that we will end up

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,150
now since a couple of years have been

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,019
working mainly on hibernate tooling and

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,240
so the thing that you will see today

00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,150
they are actually mainly done by by

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,059
George castaldi who is a somewhere here

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,130
yeah is the leader of the forge so

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,469
actually he should he should be here on

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,649
stage to talk about it but he lets us

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,399
have our 15 minutes of fame thank you

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:53,280
George and he's giving a lab tomorrow

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:54,780
about yes it's tomorrow so so we are

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,920
still working on the technical issues

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,390
but I'm Sebastian blonde I'm fifty

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,170
percent French fifty percent Dutch you

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:11,280
hear the French part with my sexy accent

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:14,250
I work at reddit as well I'm hour on the

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,369
reddit mobile team i joined where that

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:22,140
for years goes and yeah on my slides you

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,100
will see my twitter handle if you want

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,070
follow my tools and i have to speak

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,180
until just two things Gooden was really

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,430
good at keep speaking yeah what you will

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:42,329
see today is awesome it's all I have to

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:44,280
say yeah now oh look yeah I think it's

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,229
better than nothing but yeah so the

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,479
colors are a bit messed up it's better

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,049
than nothing yeah the term that was my

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,649
next part we said we only have two

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,540
slides or three slides because that's a

00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:59,729
def flow it's 4d blow over cuz it's

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,890
though we don't have boring sly so you

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,030
just have two flights and then it will

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,030
be only live coding

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:16,640
okay next light yeah so when you start

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,519
up a new projects you are facing the

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,940
whole setup you have to create a new

00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,830
project create a whole skeleton you have

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,620
to be careful to follow the right

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,190
practices you have to do boring stuff

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,989
like setting up your persistence layer

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,530
creating your models creating the

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:40,220
relation stuff like that and you will

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,880
probably make a lot of mistakes and you

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,269
will lose a lot of time so you can move

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,430
to the next slide we have a solution for

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,610
that and the solution for that is forged

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:56,620
so Forge is a rat tool for rapid

00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:00,260
application development tool and that

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,940
relies on few principles that are famous

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,640
in the world maybe you know grills or

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,120
rails there are also right tools so

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,239
what's integrated so you have principle

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,030
of keeping it simple keep it stupid

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,200
simple by don't repeating yourself and

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,700
by using convention rather than

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,850
configuration so that are the free

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:29,420
acronyms that you must not say aloud in

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:31,910
this order so you can use it you can use

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,970
this tool standalone it has a really

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,269
nice Eli but we have integration for the

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,519
three main EDS meaning Eclipse netbeans

00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,530
and NT j but you will see that in the

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,760
demo that will start in less than a

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,419
minute it's extendable what does it mean

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,489
it's really easy to create your own

00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:55,310
add-ins imagine you have a project and

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,930
you sometimes each each time you add a

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,819
new feature you have a whole process

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,849
whole classes that you have to generate

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,709
a configuration you have to do if you

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:07,280
see that you have to repeat this task

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,260
and tap em every time well it could be a

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,829
good solution to write your own Adam and

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,740
add it to your Forge tooling so that's

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:20,989
what i mean by extendable

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:27,440
and I think we can start for the demon

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:30,200
oh right so let's start my bus gave me a

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,070
call two minutes ago and say hey listen

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:37,100
kunin Sabathia in 40 minutes I need a

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:40,190
complete book store application java ee

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,200
7 I want to rest endpoints I want to

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,750
deploy it as a micro service I want to

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,080
angular front end I want everything and

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,060
you have 40 minutes kun do you think we

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:59,780
can do that no because the command

00:04:50,060 --> 00:05:02,030
forces well let me see let me see what's

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,520
going on here yet you're already you

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:10,250
know you're already in a you're already

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:14,480
in the Forge yeah yeah yeah yeah so I

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,640
fortress already started ok so I'm using

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,100
the command line here and I start Forge

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,130
just by typing it's the fault ok or

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:29,230
should we increase a bit fund yeah can

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:29,230
you increase bit default yes like this

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:38,630
ok so now for just started and we can

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:40,820
start issuing commands and of course you

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,680
need a little bit of experience but if

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,990
you want to start a new project the

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,750
thing that you should do is project new

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,810
you can actually do this by typing and

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,240
then when you don't know really what is

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,070
possible you you hit tab and then it

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,940
gives you all the possibilities just

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:02,590
like you what you would expect so we

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,590
will create a bookstore project

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,050
right were to move maybe you can do LS

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,229
to show though it's not that exciting

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,889
but it's just classic maven project okay

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:20,169
classic maven see your bum so this is

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:25,979
the command line thing for the

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:28,960
hardliners right rocky we can actually

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,160
use the IDE integration that you talked

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,289
about and now let's start with antique J

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,620
Intelligencer so we were on board this

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:43,539
project into IntelliJ and continue using

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:47,410
forge in IntelliJ so we import our

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:54,729
bookstore app okay can keep all the

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:58,690
defaults here we go awesome now we have

00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:03,220
our bookstore projects shall we start

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,800
create a new entity okay for instance a

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,750
book since it's a bookstore so for

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,090
creating entities we start forward you

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:17,680
can see it below there it says loading

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:19,840
jboss forge so you use a key combination

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,530
in this case in my case its outcome and

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,680
four and then it it starts under the

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,419
hood starts of jails forge and then when

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,190
for just started this happens only once

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,409
with the fridge the first combination

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,710
when for just started you get all the

00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:39,400
possible commands that you can condition

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,740
so in this case it's a new entity book a

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,810
new entity I can scroll through the list

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,330
but I can also start typing I know it's

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,690
a jpa thing yeah because mella i said i

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,240
reduced the scope of all the things i

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,000
create a new entity oh just one on the

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,970
screen because it's a first GPA entity

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,199
that we create for to see that though we

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:04,449
propose to set up our GPA configuration

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,300
so here we will stay on the on the

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:11,259
default we can use we are using

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,940
hibernate database which stay on h2 but

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:17,080
maybe you can just click on it to show

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:20,500
that you here you can basically choose

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:25,750
ever database you one but we for demo h2

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:31,629
is awesome so here we create our entity

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:34,360
book and it's all we need and it creates

00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:36,279
an almost empty class for us it's just

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,800
all the stuff you see here is for GPA to

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:44,769
process your entity and we just have an

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:54,430
ID so I think we can add a field to our

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:56,649
book like title so here we just say how

00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,490
we want our field to be called it's a

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,649
string and here we go let us also

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:09,579
generate the setters and getters for us

00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:13,300
so okay um can you show me if it works

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:15,779
in netbeans it's a question Oh Christian

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,779
yeah sure

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:34,300
it's generated by my Forge by Forge it's

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:38,260
great to have Georgie I can't walk see

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,630
the questions ok so now I'm starting up

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,510
a netbeans natural thing in action here

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:48,310
over here is even simpler you can just

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:57,490
import open the project and it will open

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:59,770
everything and I have the book thing or

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:07,210
there's something we have forgot to to

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:09,220
show or is it resources I guess yeah so

00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:14,980
there has been a few resources that have

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:22,230
been generated by setting up jpa yeah

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:22,230
you have the resistance of XML file ok I

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,839
don't know if there is a source view on

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,839
this I'm not used to using that beam so

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,230
anyway doesn't matter shall we create a

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:41,830
new entity and utter because a book as

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:44,020
an utter and Creighton so here it's a

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,040
bit different you have to type there

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,250
unless there is something that I'm

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,260
missing but you you have to start typing

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,650
there and it starts forged normally

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,600
behind the scenes and it can also take a

00:10:53,650 --> 00:11:02,260
while it's kind of a drawback I think on

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:07,290
this platform it takes a while for some

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:15,269
reason yep

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:18,660
JP a new entity and as you can see we

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:26,970
have a similar wizard that is a issued

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:38,060
or that is coming up author okay and

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:49,319
let's add a name to the author field

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:51,990
name okay okay we can move to now we're

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:54,269
going to go to the really good tool

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,170
because that's the one that I'm that I'm

00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:01,470
working on it's a JBoss developer studio

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:05,910
now this deserves a few maybe a few

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:12,269
comments jboss developer studio is based

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:15,589
on Eclipse and it's it's actually a

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:18,600
bunch of plugins the plugins that are

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:22,940
developed and under the project of jboss

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:26,480
tools that are packed packaged and and

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,980
integrated in in Eclipse under the

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:37,670
product name jboss developer studio

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:37,670
right okay

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:48,230
and only for the rest of the demo we

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:50,430
will stay on ya enjoy the stools imports

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,760
important existing maven project

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,280
projects this is one thing that I don't

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,070
like about I'm come to realize this

00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,760
using the other platforms the import of

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:06,090
a of projects is pretty hard and

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:12,690
compared to the other ones you have to

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:15,810
really click a lot okay in the meantime

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,510
I can start forge it can be done on in

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,850
two different ways you have a embedded

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,640
forge console here so you can actually

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,550
type within your tables developer studio

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,010
environment or you can use a key

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:33,570
combination which in my case it's is a

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:36,450
command for and then this this thing

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:39,230
comes up that Forge is being starting

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:42,300
now you might for people that are really

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,340
have really a keen eye they have they

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:49,470
must have seen that i'm using forged

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:51,360
three bed at three on jb des on IntelliJ

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,010
and that means it was better for right

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,280
but I assume there is not a lot of

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,080
difference comes from an update that I

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,560
did and it automatically pulls in the

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:07,310
latest version okay so the plan was to

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:13,020
let add some new fields to the book

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:15,630
entity like a publication date and of

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:24,060
course create a relation from the book

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:29,700
and author so okay new fields you field

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:35,900
and appreciation late and the type will

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,900
be day java java.util.date

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:55,029
yes okay okay and we want an utter on

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:58,380
our counter sue you feel as well utter

00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:02,380
and here we can well we can search for

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:08,230
other in the truth appear here at work

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:10,329
here we go and nice thing is here you

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,870
can select which relation to that so

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:17,139
it's many to one relation of course and

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:22,449
it will add the right annotation maybe

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:25,690
you can show it on the utter yeah you

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:29,980
see it has ADD many-to-one so we're

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,019
basically done I think that we can our

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,800
back-end is done we need a front-end now

00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:38,110
too right I do all the credit program I

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,889
know I know you are keen on very flashy

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,680
mobile mobile let's start also let's

00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:50,079
start with all this stuff right let's do

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:53,410
some jsf stuff so that's one really

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,709
powerful feature of 42 scaffolding so

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,380
basically it will parse your model and

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:02,260
from that based on templates it will

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:07,990
generate complete credit application for

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:12,310
you so all you have to do is to choose

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:15,060
your entities so I think oh just to set

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,250
up as well so it will set up multiple

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,959
things for you which otherwise you know

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,089
you might have to go in Google because

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,680
you know how do you setup CD I how do

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,410
you set up how do you prepare your

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,019
project to set up to jb's how do you you

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,970
know all these things in which versions

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:33,699
work together which one which ones

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,089
doesn't so it's all done in this setup

00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:42,389
wizard and then you can just do the

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,389
select all and the magic happens

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,950
and now maybe you can show a bit what

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,960
has been generated and then we are ready

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,020
to deploy and we should have our

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,730
bookstore app so this scaffolding step

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,250
generates quite a few few things

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,660
actually it generates back beans jsf mag

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:11,540
beans like the ultra-beam for instance

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:15,170
it has generated a lot of stuff in the

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:18,280
web app folder mainly for the both the

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:22,910
entities it create it generates facelets

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:26,840
bits of HTML that make up your your user

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:30,020
interface and it will also generate the

00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,730
beans XML faces config and web xml files

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:37,960
for you now we can deploy that we will

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,950
deploy this application on wildfly and

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,890
so all you have to do is to drag drag

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,380
and drop your project here that's right

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:52,190
i didn't knew that you show me that just

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,160
before that's awesome that's where you

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:59,510
can deploy your app ok here you can see

00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,940
the water i console so our app is almost

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:07,030
deployed it is deployed it's deployed ok

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:10,370
so um why Shh we can open a browser and

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,580
take a look at our awesome book store

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,580
app

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:28,200
localhost in port 8080 of course and

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:33,250
it's called the bookstore and hear that

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:40,870
Ben scaffolding folded for us so here we

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:43,180
can George earth and which runs books

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:49,930
about fortune a book about Forge

00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:57,900
surprising publication date today is the

00:18:49,930 --> 00:19:03,790
55th yeah okay and here we can select

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:05,710
George oh that was to show that we have

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,560
also for free when we scaffold some

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:12,930
validation and hearsay hey the format is

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:19,150
not correct okay so he will correct that

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:23,800
and yeah we so we have to create a read

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,870
list we can edit an existing entity just

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,610
to show you to show that we have all the

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:33,550
learn the correct function so forward I

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:39,570
don't know what you want to do yeah 6

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:41,590
awesome okay can we add some more

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:45,070
constraints some more validations

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,440
because valid a publication date and six

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,840
februari that is not possible that is in

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,920
the future can we do something about

00:19:49,840 --> 00:20:01,270
that all right we can do this okay we

00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:04,060
can add some constraints and we just

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,820
issue again the keyboard combination

00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:14,310
command star I could also use this one

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:16,230
here right constraints mmm Horace ads

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:24,290
I don't know it's not their mothers

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:24,290
possible hmm okay

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,750
add constraint okay will be used we will

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,000
use hibernate validator for that okay

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,370
this is again a set up step right it

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,450
just just will create a validation of

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:45,940
XML file for you on the book that's

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,580
right and then we say on which property

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:54,820
well the publication date and we want it

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:57,940
to be in the past so easy as this we

00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:02,800
have now to constraint and if we deploy

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:06,670
it again so really poor we should have

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:15,130
this just here full publish yeah fo

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:22,390
publish now of course the drawback is

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:25,450
that i have to recreate my oops okay i

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,210
have to recreate our because we started

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,480
we are using an in-memory database so

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:34,560
each time that we deploy well database

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,560
is destroyed

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:46,320
oh it are you in search of the vacation

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:53,410
day so if you type the sixth of februari

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:55,270
six verb okay yeah and you do safe you

00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,730
got a validation must be in the past so

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,760
that is also handled really easily so

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:07,570
you can really add validation to your

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:09,700
application without too much looking out

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,040
hypothetically director were sore that's

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:18,240
like that run it's all scaffold for you

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:24,190
so we have our old school GSF app but

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:26,470
now we want to expose the bookstore app

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,030
we want to expose that's what I do like

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,010
about it you have more work because you

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,260
need to recreate rest and pouring sand

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,050
all the colors i want west nine points

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,660
so everything can consume it and mobile

00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:40,059
app could consume our book store app and

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,330
connected object who consume it sir so

00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:45,940
do you think we can generate yeah so we

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:50,620
already have what like JP a tray

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:53,200
yourself ejb let's add some Jackson CDI

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:57,040
right with all these things now track

00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,040
service okay so that's where you command

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:04,090
that I love it's it's a bit magic man

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:06,340
for me and it's called generate iron

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,530
point from entities that's exactly what

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,590
we want so basically you choose your

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:14,040
entities first you set up your jax-rs

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:19,780
your web setup we can keep the default

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:23,950
you select your entities and you click

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,900
finish and wow it generates the end

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,140
point for you though for those that I

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:33,510
don't know if you know a bit jax-rs I'm

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:37,990
going to use this one oh like a teacher

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:40,990
so cool don't hit me with a hey so

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,160
basically this annotation here path that

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,800
is the rest path of our

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,340
entity and then each method we can just

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,550
annotate and like when a post request

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:56,330
will arrive as well go into this method

00:23:52,550 --> 00:24:01,340
and it consumes season and the gets

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:06,650
maybe you can sure get and get is over

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:09,560
there get he produces Jason maybe you

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,990
can show also we have that in jgbs is

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,910
witty knife doesn't have vents because

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,100
we've just two end points but when you

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:19,520
have a lot of endpoints you can blow

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:23,060
this one really easily from here there

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,270
are small atoms from table stools but so

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,610
are really useful i havena meantime I've

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:31,700
redeployed this application oh you're

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:37,460
already deployed it ok so i will create

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:41,950
new few new items here again or the one

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,950
item that I always at least one item ya

00:24:51,460 --> 00:25:07,340
know six save ha oh yeah ok here we go

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:09,590
and let's find out if our rests I'm

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,780
point is deployed correctly so for that

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,990
we are also using a small tool that is

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:18,350
in jboss tools there's the web service

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,580
tester it's a bit like plasmon if you

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,490
are used to plasmin but here it's

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:27,050
integrated in a so basically here you

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:32,000
will fire and get requests on our books

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:35,290
and as you can see we respond so that

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,160
means our app is deployed every

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:45,560
everything can consume it now that we

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:49,630
had that shall we scaffold an angular

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,950
app right because we are cool kids

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,430
but the problem is I don't know anything

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,170
about angular yeah with force you don't

00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,410
need to know about it fortunately you

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,550
don't because I did it for you I

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:07,070
scaffolded on another web root so i can

00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:12,050
use both on this at the same time will

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:19,120
select everything and it will ya maybe

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:21,950
you can know if we look in the web app

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,340
in the angular part here we have a

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:29,660
complete standalone web application now

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:33,440
it's embedded in our java ee project but

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:36,590
basically you could take this folder and

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,240
run it in an OGS server or even if you

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,460
want some hybrid mobile apps you can

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,620
just grab that paste that in a Cordova

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:48,500
app and it's just running so it's really

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:50,270
stand alone and I think we can already

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,220
be deployed it's already boarded again

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:58,550
so i can so i can now we can go to a

00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:02,930
bookstore for instance bookstore hang

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:05,060
right it was and then you see that is

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:13,850
the angular application is running in

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:22,340
your browser ok maybe you can create yep

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:25,640
again an utter angular and on bootstrap

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,970
so it's on based on bootstrap free i

00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,110
think and that means of course that it

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:35,930
is responsive so once kun is done with

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:39,040
creating a so this has a different you

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:43,510
can see it has a different validation

00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:48,530
based on the local kill so i need to use

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:53,240
2016 02

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:56,560
fire yeah this is also draw Becky that

00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:01,060
you need to you can actually adapt it by

00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:04,100
editing the generated class a little bit

00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:08,720
yeah we could do that because we have

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:12,110
ten minutes left no but we can now do

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:20,950
the program as do the plugin so the

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:20,950
plugin oh yeah identification security

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:27,770
well we are working on a plan Adam for

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,980
that that will add the cloak security I

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,210
don't know if you know about key clock

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:36,980
while key clock is separate

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:41,600
identification server and it's really

00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,100
easy to secure your app using that it's

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,270
too bad actually de to talk for that

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,890
Ford F company was not accepted but

00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,810
today tomorrow I will be happy to show

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,860
you if you want I can give you a small

00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,860
demo of it and

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,670
yes yeah so it's a one sharp generation

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:08,980
but of course you know as simple as it

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:12,130
is it doesn't matter really yeah we can

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:15,790
show again because I showed the angular

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:18,940
stuff in Firefox which is not so

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,280
interesting we have some something

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,730
really cool here in jbs which is called

00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:33,850
browser sin don't know if people know

00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:35,470
this okay yeah now opens this one on

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,690
this file I guess that I'm that I've

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:44,160
selected but that's not interesting I

00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:44,160
want to of course use my application

00:29:51,870 --> 00:30:00,310
store right this is what you see when

00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:03,520
you know when you use the normal normal

00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:06,460
the basis of the faces scaffolding which

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,570
is of course not very nice on a phone or

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:14,350
on a mobile device so that's why we

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:17,530
actually why we did the angular stuff so

00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,180
if we do this then you have the angular

00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:23,980
version of it the bookstore application

00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:27,070
and as you would expect you have the the

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,770
menu there and I'm burger many and you

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,340
can you can just create a new order this

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,340
bus is cool

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:48,590
right okay you can also rotate it okay

00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:51,530
and then it's it shows you to the other

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:55,460
version the other the other way so it's

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:57,080
okay civ and that's why what what I told

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,320
just before you can you could take it

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:05,960
take that and put it in a hybrid app if

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:11,500
you want a native app or distance cool

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:14,030
so one last thing that we can show is a

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:18,230
how to you how you would extend the

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:20,120
forge by creating a forge plugin and a

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,850
forge plugin is nothing else than a

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:30,080
project so the way how you start is just

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:34,190
by creating a new project hello world

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:39,530
all right we don't we don't have the

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:41,630
time for the key cloak plugin and then

00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,760
you have to select a different project

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:48,020
type which in this case would be a forge

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:52,390
Adam okay we just accept all the

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,390
defaults I think yeah

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:05,290
and then it creates the hello world

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:15,100
project and then to create an actual

00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:18,210
command you use the January verge Adam

00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,210
new UI commands

00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:32,780
see hello

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:32,780
um come on name I don't know

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:47,570
say hello no okay finish and what it

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,910
does it creates a template class in

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,640
which you can in which you see that

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,200
there is a UI that can be initialized

00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,260
and execution method that by default

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,300
results in a you know basically that is

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:06,170
where you will put all your custom logic

00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,300
like generating foul of course because

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:12,920
we are because we are curious as to how

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:17,750
how to put us in to work we can do this

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:23,750
by Forge build and install and add on

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:26,090
all right and then it will behind the

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:30,050
scenes invoke a maven build of this of

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:32,450
this project install it and then the

00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:38,090
next time we hit our key or key

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:41,780
combination then it will will move out

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:47,270
in demo demo okay is there say hello

00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:51,380
right become our greatest head and now

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:56,960
the interesting part is that if you go

00:33:51,380 --> 00:34:07,420
back to your command line yeah then this

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:07,420
project is in another location software

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:20,850
oryx pieces of the world

00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:31,390
okay now we're in this project yeah we

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:37,660
can do the same here right what is

00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:42,460
called Forge no hablo de build and

00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:50,290
install and there does the same thing so

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:56,410
we can just afterwards we have to say

00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:57,700
hello here available okay of course to

00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:00,310
make this really meaningful you would

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,920
have to add you I and and in the execute

00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:06,880
method to do something really useful

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,220
like create creating some XML some XML

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,930
file or or adding something to a pom

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:17,230
file or that kind of stuff right and

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:19,720
it's um gets get up you can install a

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:23,110
badan by point food get to account

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,970
exactly yeah I think it's time for it

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,170
yeah i think we probably did everything

00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,080
we want to do everything like for the

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:31,090
questions I don't know if I'm if I have

00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:37,830
I need to review to refresh this or oh

00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:48,460
just refreshes should be garish wait 40

00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:54,040
you can scroll is it for doesn't work

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:57,910
okay I didn't either like that you know

00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,330
it by your head yeah it's don't judge a

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:03,850
man by his questions by his answers by

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:07,060
rock but rather by his questions so

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:09,280
meaning and it says it's by voltaire so

00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,620
this smart guy tells us that it's

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,750
actually you shouldn't judge me because

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,580
of what I answer you on your question

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,720
but I should judge you because we

00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:22,650
weren't you question all right aren't

00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,650
any questions

00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:43,829
yeah so they work on a text bit of

00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:46,349
course there is if you do Java

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:48,150
generation then you have the Java MIT

00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:51,660
but then it's a java the java add-on

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,450
with its api roaster actually Adam with

00:36:51,660 --> 00:37:00,390
its API that you're using which has a

00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:02,250
metamodel but there is no for for the

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,079
rest there is no specific metamodel use

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,290
there's nothing proprietary or something

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,569
like that that is used so yeah this

00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:12,480
purely text-based pump oh the only thing

00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:14,490
that is probably important for me even

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,160
though there is a great way of doing

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:22,020
stuff which was contributed but the

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:26,630
maven pom file file projects are the

00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,630
most mature things to do right

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:57,010
no okay that we win yeah of course yeah

00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,230
I'll contribute we're out of time yeah

00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,960
okay so if you have any other questions

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,530
we are hanging here today and tomorrow

00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,359
and if you want to do this hands-on most

00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:10,240
of the things that you see today there

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,150
will be will be done to tomorrow in the

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,220
lab right for George and the absolute we

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:19,320
know will also give a talk about swarm

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:23,589
and you will be using fortune happy so

00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,710
with the latest addin thank you very

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,710
much

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:41,300
what did you bet oh you mean I have

00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:44,300
another one so maybe this one's just

00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,300
