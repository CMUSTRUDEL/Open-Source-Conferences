Description: 
	The Borg is docking your system; testing is futile! Or is it? With microservices, polyglot, and DevOps on the rise, where are we at with testing?

Do these technologies bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder, or maybe the contrary? Do they actually help us write better tests more easily?

This session explores not only how we can do our testing in this new world but also how the new world can help us test better.

It takes a close look at various topics, from NodeJS, DynJS, VertX, Ceylon or Ruby, orchestrated microservices, system scale testing with various configurations to database migration and regression testing.All are within reach.
