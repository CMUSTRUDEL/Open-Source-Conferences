Description: 
	With constantly growing business demands more and more focus is put on gathering business knowledge and making use of it in IT. Knowledge Is Everything - that’s a slogan that lots of business domains is catching up right now.
On the other hand, recent trends in software development are shifting into micro services environments where loosely coupled, standalone and independent services provide access to various business assets. 
With that in mind, knowledge driven micro service idea came into live to combine couple of great technologies together to satisfy such needs:
- vert.x - toolkit for building reactive applications on JVM
- jBPM and Drools flexible process and rule engines that provide excellent execution environment for business assets - the knowledge
- hazelcast - in memory data grid
- various programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Scala, Groovy) to attract various development teams

This session is about illustrating how easily and fast you can build knowledge driven micro services and scale them to almost no limits. All in reactive and polyglot fashion with powerful clustering. Scale individual knowledge micro services without a hassle and allow various languages to easily interact with business knowledge without a need to know where they are located. It all goes via clustered event bus provided by Vert.x, backed by deployable knowledge archives provided by jBPM and Drools, clustering delivered by hazelcast data grid and allow polyglot client side access.

It’s all about business knowledge that can be delivered as software solution with:
- flexibility
- speed of development
- isolated scalability
- manageability 

Come and see how to transform your IT solutions into knowledge driven micro services with Vert.x, jBPM, Drools and Hazelcast. This session will be full of life demos to actually show the running micro services driven by business knowledge.
