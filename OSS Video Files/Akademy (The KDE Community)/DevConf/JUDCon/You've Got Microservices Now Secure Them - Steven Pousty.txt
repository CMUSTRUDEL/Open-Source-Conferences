Description: 
	You went ahead a built a whole new set of shiny microservices. While doing this, you realized that you can no longer rely on your application server to handle all the authentication. Oh, and of course, one of your teams used Node.js. How are you going to secure all the endpoints so that end users donâ€™t have to authenticate against each one. This session demonstrates use of a centralized authentication service to secure many different microservice architectures. The demos focus on the Keycloak project but apply just as much to Stormpath, Auth0, and similar services.
