greetings humans

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,559
i'm here to introduce you to vr chat

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,960
this is where you will first appear when

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,599
you log in

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,599
this is vrchat home the default location

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
where you will always spawn

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119
unless you replace it with something

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,880
else

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
the first thing you should do is go

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,920
through your settings

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
as with any other game

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,079
should look at your audio volumes

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,960
this is what i go with and often times

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
i play with the world volume depending

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,559
on where am i

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
what's the levels of the world they're

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
not all even because it's all user

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,960
generated content

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,320
you you never know where you will land

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,039
usually between 75 and 100 is so

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
my go to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,680
further you have all port

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
which is basically the if you're on vr i

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
should say

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,640
holoport is the teleportation mode for

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,080
movement

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,200
comfort turning is snap turning

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,439
that will snap you in degrees

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
if you're experienced vr user you

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,880
probably prefer

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,000
smooth motion so you would want to

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,759
disable those

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
these are enabled by default

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,079
you should also disable personal space

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,360
it's a kind of bounding box around you

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,320
if someone goes closer than a certain

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,520
range

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,920
they will simply disappear

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,439
you should enable all untrusted user

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
urls

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
this really applies only to video

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,280
players so for streaming

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,159
video streaming or music streaming and

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,280
other things

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
uh at devconf we haven't decided yet on

00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,600
how

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,079
we will be streaming the presentations

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,159
we may be using untrusted url

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,360
trusted urls are the usual suspects

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,840
twitch

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
youtube and other services

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,599
another important thing in settings that

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
you should visit is safety

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
up here

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,280
i use my custom settings that

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,080
also reflect the performance the

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,000
hardware performance that you're on

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,000
if you're not on powerful machine you

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,120
might be a little bit more

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,560
restricted with what you can enable

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,239
by default you would be here

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,360
i think what this means

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,800
these are different user ranks

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
i'm a trusted user i've been in vrchat

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
for

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,400
really long time even though not really

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,400
but that's another story you will be

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,519
maybe visitor maybe new user very

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,879
quickly

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,720
user takes a little while and further it

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
slows down it's kind of like levels in

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
an

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,840
rpg game this serves to

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,840
protect you from random people

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
new users who don't know how to use vr

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,840
chat in the first place

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:21,120
oftentimes these kinds of people use

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,319
very invasive intrusive others that are

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,200
either really huge

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,159
or they have a lot of effects or shaders

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
that

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,200
can shake your vision and do other kinds

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
of

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
unpleasant things so i'll get used to it

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,319
it's best

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,319
to simply keep only these three

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,319
and i recommend this for the first two

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,239
ranks as it is by default

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,400
as you go higher you see that things are

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,599
starting to appear

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,959
what is audio audio is

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,120
various effects

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,280
that people can have on their avatars

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
for instance if i'm a dragon

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,879
i can scream like a dragon you know big

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,760
cloud drawer

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,360
that would be this audio toggle custom

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
animations

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,799
i recommend enabling these as soon as

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,400
possible

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
because they're not very intrusive and

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,040
they disable way too much

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,040
for instance you see i have some armor

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
but i can change it to different

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,720
clothing

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
that is also custom animation so you

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
wouldn't even see people in their

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,960
correct clothing they

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,080
are wearing

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,600
next particles and shaders

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
these may be really interesting these

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,560
are the most intrusive

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,000
pieces of the whole avatar setup that

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
you could have

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,199
because they can change everything they

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
can even

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
render images directly in your vision

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,240
completely blinding you

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,040
that's why you wouldn't want this bellow

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,320
half the rank basically

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,720
because there are also malicious people

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
who will create a new account going to a

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
public world

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
and try to do nasty stuff they could

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
quickly banned create a new account

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,199
they never progress through the ranks

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,320
usually

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,400
my setup kind of reflects everything

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,919
enabled above user

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,919
and disabled under user

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,080
shaders and particles also affect the

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,919
performance a lot

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,440
animations audio user icons do not

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,520
voice you wouldn't hear anyone if you

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,160
disable it avatar

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,160
that's basically a very basic um

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,320
just a mesh without without nice shaders

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
so it will have like for instance my

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,280
armor wouldn't be shiny

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
it would be just kind of like a gray um

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
boring kind of thing but you would still

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,080
see

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,759
so if you're on a potato computer you

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
might want to set up your custom

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
settings the way where you are showing

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,240
only avatar

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,440
new hide particles and shaders and you

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
could still enable

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,199
animations that's what i would do for

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,199
instance

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,520
friends are people you've added as a

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,039
friend so you can also enable everything

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,479
for those maybe

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,720
maybe not you access user specific menu

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,319
you open up this little pop-up menu then

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
you can click on someone

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
and here we can see buttons like hide

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,840
avatar

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
show avatar or review safety settings

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
you can also turn off their voice change

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,919
their

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
user specific volume or you can block

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
them

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
if you see someone who is really

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,199
intrusive annoying harassing someone

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
that's what the button is for you can

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,440
report people as well

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,919
which i'm not gonna do because this is

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,919
my friend

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
now that we've seen how to enable and

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,479
hide avatars

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,479
handle safety settings there is one more

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
thing i would like to show you

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
here in the corner of safety settings

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,919
you have performance options

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,520
here you can hide avatars based on

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,639
download size

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,000
for instance my very custom and complex

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,319
avatar

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,319
while it's not very heavy on performance

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,120
it has a lot of different clothing a lot

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,720
of swords and different items

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,080
it is over 30 megabytes i've said this

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
500 because i don't care

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
you can set it to 20 or something lower

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,080
if you would like to actually

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,919
have useful limit here on download size

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,000
this will help you if you have

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,599
slower internet connection because

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,039
everyone someone appears

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,680
every time someone appears it may lag

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
your con

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
your game if your connection is very

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,360
slow

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
minimum displayed performance rank so

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,160
it's excellent

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,720
good medium poor and very poor

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
this shows how many polygons how many

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
materials

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
you do have on your avatar and other

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,400
things

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,639
so if you don't care if you have

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,879
powerful computers set it to very poor

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,599
if you do care i would recommend setting

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,599
it too poor

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,800
that's the biggest step is between these

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,240
two

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,960
medium is medium to poor isn't that much

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,960
of a difference

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
uh the enemy pawn the menu sometimes

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,120
jumps away

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,720
safety performance option dynamic ball

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,000
this is uh as you can see i disable

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,360
these limits

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,160
my hair dynamic bone things that are

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,760
physically simulated that move

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,480
if i do this you can see the wings move

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,279
as well

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,320
with physics that's also dynamic bones

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,120
it's cpu heavy dynamic bones are cpu

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,480
heavy

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,160
shaders particles gpu heavy last but not

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,000
least item on

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,080
these settings that you may have noticed

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,440
real user height that's not actually the

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,880
user height

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,040
this setting reflects arm span

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
so as you can see here if you are in

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,399
full body tracking so you can move your

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
legs

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,920
reducer height is your arm span when you

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,560
are in t pose

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,360
from left arm right arm it's not about

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
height

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,959
you want to have it set to correct value

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,080
that when you stretch your arms

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,240
they are nicely straight not bent and

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,160
not too short

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
so like if you were too short you would

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,120
stretch your arm and to drag your whole

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,839
head

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,640
your whole torso to the side that's not

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,720
good

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,399
it's very avatar dependent user

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,800
generated content different avatars

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,800
different

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,120
proportions next how do we join

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,320
worlds you can search for worlds in

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,720
worlds category using the search

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
you have all kinds of recommended or

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,880
suggested

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
categories you can favorite worlds for

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
instance

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,800
i have this faculty of informatics here

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,640
our venue i can favorite it

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,920
and add it to one of my categories for

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
different worlds

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,200
sometimes it doesn't load so it's

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,200
showing us zero but i have some

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,079
but it's fine let's ignore minor banks

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,040
you can either directly join a world or

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,399
you can drop a portal which can be used

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,399
by others as well

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:54,079
portals disappear in under half a minute

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,519
however by default what you can see here

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,519
this is a public instance

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
it means anyone can join it you might

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,480
want to create a new instance

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
set it to friendsplus that's any friend

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,040
of a user

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,519
who can who is already there can join

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,399
friends of friends basically friends

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,640
only only your own friends

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
in white plus anyone can invite people

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,200
invite only

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
only you can invite people

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,200
most commonly used is friends plus for

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
deathcon purposes will be using friends

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
only

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,399
that means in order to join our instance

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,519
of faculty of informatics

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,560
you must be a friend with our devconf

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,200
account

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
joining our instance of devconf you

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,600
would go to

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,040
social and here you would find

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,480
our devconf account our devkov

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,519
account will be set as bluestate

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,560
like me blue means

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,120
that anyone can join you don't need a

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,880
permission from the user however the

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,720
instance limitations still apply

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
by default you are green so you would

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,200
receive invite requests

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
by blue they are automatically accepted

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
so you would find our devconf account

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,760
you would click on it

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
and then you would have a button here

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,040
join

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,720
i can show it to you on someone else for

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
instance here

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,839
we would have a button join here this

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,279
person is in a

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,480
world that is either friends uh either

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:44,399
invite only or invite plus

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,320
that means i cannot join them

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,760
or friends only world of someone else

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
not their own

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,959
so i have a request invite button here

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,920
when i click it

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,079
to send them a notification that i would

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,240
like to join them and they can invite me

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,880
you can integrate people using the

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,880
invite button

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
instead of this request invite button

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,480
you will have a join

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,079
and that directly joins others

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,000
let's see if we have someone in a public

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,120
world

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,160
see walter here is in a public world

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,680
whom i can just directly join and i will

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,680
immediately teleport over there

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,959
and that concludes our tour of vr chat

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,880
when you get to the dev menu

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,760
you will appear in a spawn room

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
do not get frightened yes it's an empty

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,680
cube

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,680
where you have nothing

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,560
here's some information that you should

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,560
really read

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
when you are done click to teleport to

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,440
the menu

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,839
you click this button you will appear

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,839
in the faculty of informatics

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,720
thank you very much

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,600
bye

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
