coffee if you're

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
playing along with our coffee kit but

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
use any coffee you've got and that would

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
be great

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,840
we'd love to have your questions therese

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,519
is interested in questions around coffee

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
brewing techniques and things like this

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,400
so please put those in the q

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
a and i'll pass them along to her

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
verbally also yesterday some people had

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,440
asked about some alternative brewing

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,520
techniques

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
yesterday we saw the clever dripper and

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
so today teresa has prepared some stuff

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,719
with aeropress with us but i think she's

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,559
ready to talk about pretty much any

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
brewing technique that typically occurs

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
with hand coffee

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
and with that teresa can you tell us

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,079
some about this coffee where does it

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,440
come from

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,640
great thank you once again welcome here

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,039
in our cafe

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
my name is teresa and i'm responsible

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,480
for education

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
in double shutter stories so whatever

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
question you have

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
should and i would love to answer all of

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,280
them

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
so today's coffee we prepared for you

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
it's

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
called inbachi the inbache is the name

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,400
of the family

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
which lives in colombia so it's our

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
colombian

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,159
farmer and

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,600
this is the one of the farmers we are

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
cooperating with

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
for the longest time for so almost for

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,799
10 years

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,600
until today we have every fresh crop of

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,600
this farmer

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
we used to call this cafe coffee carlos

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,119
embache by the father of the family but

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
right now he has two or three daughters

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,399
and sons so

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
now it's just the name of the whole

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,320
family

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360
so as you noticed you have some

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,240
description

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,640
of the coffee here under the under the

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
name

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,280
there's a set plums sugarcane and

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,759
lemongrass i will go

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
for that a little bit later what does it

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
mean and how does it

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
uh get there and the taste because it's

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
not the artificial

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
taste it's the natural taste of the

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
coffee

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
but at first i would love to talk about

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
ira press because i heard that you

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
requested to

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
to see one of these methods but after

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
that

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,160
if you want we can also follow it for

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
example

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,959
we 60 or

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,040
french press or whatever you choose

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,280
so for every filter coffee what we need

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,000
is a hot water definitely the water

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,200
shouldn't be

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,200
boiling but near to boiling so i have my

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,599
set on a 96 degrees of celsius

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
and then we have need some freshly

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,879
grounded coffee

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,280
i pre-grounded my coffee because i

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,560
didn't want to disturb us with the

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,879
sound of the grinder and for especially

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
for

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,599
iropress we need to paper paper filters

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
so for those of you who are not familiar

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,560
with this

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,560
equipment it's a really clever one for

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
for traveling for example because it's

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
light and

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
you can stock it in your backpack and do

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,239
it wherever

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,040
you are it has three parts so it has

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,239
this

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,239
part where the paper filter is sitting

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,879
so there are paper filters which are

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
original to the

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,680
iro press so if you bought the ira pred

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,720
press you had your filters already

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
there you put the paper filter on the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,879
bottom

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
and as with every other filter method

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159
you need to

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,400
rinse the filter first because we want

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,360
to get rid of this paper taste in the

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
filter

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
then we have this middle part where we

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,680
put the

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,159
filter afterwards we put the coffee

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
inside pour hot water

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,280
and then we use this plunger or how to

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
say it

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,439
which we put on the top and we gently

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,799
press it

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
so that's the reason why we call it

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
aeropress

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:14,080
so at first i will rinse the filter with

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:16,799
the hot water

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,759
don't forget to get rid of this water to

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,160
not

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
dilute your coffee

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,919
then he put their grounded coffee about

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,880
the grind size it should be

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,080
some like mildly coarse not too fine

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
like a powder

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,840
but not too coarse like the like scent

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
or something like that so

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,680
it's somewhere in the middle about the

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
recipe

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,919
for all filter methods there is a

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,040
universal recipe which calls for

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,520
60 grams of coffee per 1 liter of water

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,560
because here we are limited by the size

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,759
of the aeropress

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,039
there is a quite a stable

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
recipe i'm using that's uh 15 grams of

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,759
coffee

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,840
per 250 grams of water

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,600
so i put all the uh arapas with this uh

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,039
with this special glass kettle on

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,160
the bottom or you can use uh some solid

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
solid muck because we will pressing hard

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
on it so

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,680
do not use something really fragile this

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,520
is the special one special glass one but

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
i would recommend you to use a normal

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,479
mark or

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
if you are somewhere outside on this

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,440
kind of metal metal max

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:41,620
so i put a coffee there

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,620
[Music]

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,680
then i'll follow with water

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,360
and it's good to pour just a little bit

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,560
of water

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,759
start your stopwatch

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,680
and gently stare this

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,720
phase we call pre-infusion

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,039
this is the moment where the gases which

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,560
are

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,479
into in like locked in the

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,280
roasted beans mainly co2

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
uh carbon dioxide it's locked in the in

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,800
the

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
beans and we want them a little bit to

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,840
get out to the gas

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
so uh we will get we'll achieve much

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
more

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,520
rich flavor so we let that sit just a

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,440
little bit of water for 30 seconds and

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,840
after 30 seconds

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
we follow with the rest of the water

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
so i put there 15 grams of coffee now

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,319
i'm filling it with

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,319
250 grams of water

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,720
i'll give it just a little stir again

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,080
and then i will put there the plunger

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,680
and i will try to maintain the under

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,120
pressure so i will put it there

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,039
and slightly pulling it

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,759
up so that creates under pressure here

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,520
and that means it will stop the dripping

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,400
of the coffee so as you can see

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
a little bit of coffee went down but not

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,360
all of it

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,639
if i wouldn't if i wouldn't close it

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
properly and didn't do this

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,039
under pressure the most of the coffee

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
brew will would go

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,240
down without proper extraction

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
so we want to a little bit prolong the

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
time of contact of the

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,319
coffee in the water and

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,240
after two two and a half minutes we want

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,680
to gently press it down

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,360
to uh to filter the coffee so for the

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,400
filtering for the pressing

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,400
time we'll put it from the scale

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,199
away now we are waiting

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,680
so the contact time of the water and the

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319
coffee depends on the grind size of the

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,720
coffee

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,599
so as as finer you grind the coffee

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,080
then the shorter the time of the contact

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,199
of the coffee and water

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,400
if you grind oppositely your coffee to

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,280
course or if you for example get some

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,720
gift where

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,520
of the back of the coffee which is

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,680
already pre-grinded

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
and you see that the grind size is too

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,039
coarse then you

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
just let it sit down there for more than

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,520
a two and a half minutes so for example

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
three or four minutes

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,080
so now it's two and a half minutes for

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,680
me for my grind size and i will now just

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,599
gently pressing it down so this is

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
why this is called aeropress because

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,959
there is this small amount of air

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,399
and we are pressing with it but do not

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,680
have the

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,200
idea that it is some kind of same like

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,200
with espresso machine because the

00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,240
pressure you are making

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,600
is not significantly bigger than

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,360
one bar of the of the atmospheric

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,640
pressure

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,640
so comparing with espresso machine there

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
you have a pressure of nine bars which

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,440
is

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,560
produced with the with the

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,040
rotational pump so this is nothing like

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,240
espresso

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,519
but it's a clever way how to filter your

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,920
coffee so after pressing all the water

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
down

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,160
you have a nice cup of coffee

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,640
so one question that came in while you

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,279
were doing this was uh

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,040
because the aeropress is so small do you

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
have any suggestions about people who

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,480
need to bring more than one cup at a

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,480
time like it for them and their partner

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,200
so there is some possibilities how to do

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,240
that uh one thing is to do

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
what we call bypass that means that for

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
example you put in the aeropress

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
more coffee for example 30 grams of

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
coffee you

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,959
fill it with the water as much as you

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,760
want as you need

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,600
and then you after that you will dilute

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
it with the hot water so you will do

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,079
something like the americano but i'm not

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,880
really a big fan of that i think that

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,519
the taste is not that rich that it could

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,320
be

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,720
so if you need more coffee the one

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,959
possibility i would choose is to

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
brew it again just do it another another

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,120
set of your coffee

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
or if you have a bigger priority

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,880
obviously there is

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
some better ways how to brew your coffee

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,480
for example in v60 where you can

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,760
do at least half a liter of coffee

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,399
at once or use some electrical

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,959
filter method but as far as you are

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,279
stuck

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
with the with the aeropress i would

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,959
suggest

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
just do one more round and do the coffee

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,079
again

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,680
uh if you if you want to do more than

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
one cup of coffee this is i think this

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,600
is the one

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,959
disadvantage to which uh iops has that

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
it's too small

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,120
so um given that piece of advice would

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
you suggest that you make your own cup

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
of coffee

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,480
make your partner's cup of coffee first

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,480
you know there's a life is a life lesson

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
here

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,600
oh it depends when i do a coffee from my

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,640
partner we

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
usually share one cup and then we do it

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,079
do it again

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,959
oh that's clever on the emergency

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,160
situation

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,240
that's clever i like that um

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
somebody else has asked uh if you can

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
talk a little about the

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,040
difference in taste expectations or how

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,120
the coffee's gonna taste

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,240
coming through say an aeropress versus

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,519
uh the french press

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,160
that's a good question so basically main

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
difference

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,860
between the aeropress and

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
french press

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,000
[Music]

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,839
is that in aeropress we are using this

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,680
paper filter this is what will do the

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,399
most like tastable

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,399
difference in contrary

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,160
sorry so in contrary in

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,079
french press you had this metal filter

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,360
so through the metal filter

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,720
always uh get some this small

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,760
smallest particles the fines you are

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,720
when we are grinding there is a

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,279
time some fine particles which will go

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,519
through

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,399
the metal filter that means that your

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,240
coffee from

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
french press would be a little bit like

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,040
a dirty it would it wouldn't look like

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,839
the aeropress we just saw where there is

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
a clear

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,360
coffee uh this

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,000
means just a disadvantage in the in like

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
a for

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
in from the point of view like the

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,360
visibility is uh

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,760
different but if you taste it uh

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
in french press the taste will be much

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,600
richer

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,920
sweeter and almost like a little bit

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
too too bitter for someone because there

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,000
are these small particles

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
but contrary to that the aeropress and

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,880
all the other methods which using

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
paper filter the taste will be clearer

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
and

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,079
with the higher acidity and

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
also a little bit um not so heavy body

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,440
so from

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,200
from french press we call this this

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
perception on your tongue that is have

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,160
heavy body because it's really

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,839
full of these small particles but the

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
aeropress will be a little bit clearer

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,639
and lighter

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,480
this is mostly it depends on your taste

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
so someone would prefer french press

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
because it has this richer taste and

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,600
uh and can achieve also the taste of

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,120
sweetness

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,560
higher sweetness and higher bitterness

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,800
but the aeropress will be a little bit

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,480
more acidic and it depends what do you

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,839
like okay and so

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
it seems like what you're saying as well

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,480
is then that i would expect um

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,720
a similar set of tastes and notes from

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,480
say the aeropress and the v60 because

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,240
they're both using

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,040
um a paper filter yeah okay that makes

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
sense

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,839
but the v60 is a continuously dripping

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
method of brewing so it's not an

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
immersion i guess okay

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,240
yeah definitely there is also this this

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
question about we call it

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,800
so the v60 is from the

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,800
um it's the part of the brewing method

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,000
we called as you said um

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
uh pour over which are constantly

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
dripping through but the aeropress and

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,279
french press is what we call

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
full immersion because there is all the

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,320
time all the particles are immersed in

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,199
the water

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,839
so that means that this is a slightly

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,680
heavier body from the full immersion

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,120
method

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,519
and even clearer and even lighter body

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
from

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,040
a purple method so if we would uh say

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,040
let's say that this

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,199
would be like a heavier body most

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
sweet and bitter taste this will be

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
something in the middle

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,440
and the v60 will will be a little bit

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,639
clearer and

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,279
uh more clear sorry and

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,279
with a little bit enhanced acidity

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,240
compared to

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,639
in a french press but basically the

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,760
taste wouldn't shouldn't be like

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,959
too different still you should

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,000
get these notes of sugarcane and plums

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,279
and lemongrass in all of them

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,920
just the intensity will be different

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,600
okay that makes sense um we also have a

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,160
question around pre-infusion

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,320
um and uh they write pre-infusion

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
methods are usually seen with pour overs

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
i i assume they're talking about like

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,079
the v60 what is the benefit of

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,800
pre-infusing for immersion

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,199
um style like the the aeropress or a

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,880
french press

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,360
basically it's not that important the

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,519
pre-infusion i did i did

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
because i have really fresh coffee

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,560
roasted just two days before

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,000
so there is this problem of the co2

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,800
uh which basically like pressing

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
against the water so just water can go

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,720
so much

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,480
into the molecules of the coffee uh such

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,240
easily

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
comparing to when it's a little bit big

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,839
acid so if you have a really really

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,000
fresh coffee one two days after roasting

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,759
then i would go for a pre-infusion even

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,279
for the full immersion coffee

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,560
but you have a point that it's not that

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
much important compared to pour over in

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,160
pour overs

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,279
we definitely want to pray infusion

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,279
every time

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,480
this is mainly because as you can see

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,839
this is the conic

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,880
um pattern of the of the v60 that

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,600
if you pour water over the ground

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,399
it will get the water will get on the

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,519
bottom

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,680
uh not so easily like in

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,000
if you if you pour all the water into

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,240
the this um

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
this shape of the of the brewer so

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,800
definitely if you have a pour over

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,680
method

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
you want to help the water to get to the

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
bottom

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,199
as fast as possible also the

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,480
pre-infusion

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,959
is the uh way how to

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
uh as i said to get the water to all the

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,520
particles and same time

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,480
so so the all the particles will uh

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,360
open in the same time and will will

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,280
extract

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,360
uh same same time okay that makes sense

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,799
um it sounds like the pre-infusion then

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,799
is important especially because the

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,640
aeropress is so small

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
whereas maybe maybe on something like a

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
french press where you've got a liter of

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
water

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,679
it's less important because there's so

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,720
much water moving around

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
okay um one of the things we had talked

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
about in the

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,440
in the pregame of this session and you

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
had referenced earlier was these words

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
at the bottom

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,840
plums sugar cane and lemongrass and i'd

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,919
asked you where did these words come

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,919
from like did the ambachi family suggest

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
them did you all do something magical to

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
come up with them do you have a random

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,160
word generator

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,080
okay so who does this magical thing is

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,520
actually microbes

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,280
so the taste of the coffee mainly

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,960
um like consists from few things one is

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,600
what we call the the terroir

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,320
so the there's a way that there's a

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,880
thing that

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
uh where a coffee grows on which type of

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
soil

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,440
and how attitude and how much rain and

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
how much

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,960
sunlight there was during the season

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,280
that uh

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,919
make some part of the taste then is the

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,480
the type of variety so for example here

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,880
you can

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,600
read katura katura is the one of the

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,160
variety of arabica

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,720
and then there is a really important

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
thing and

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,160
it's the method of processing so we have

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,960
a washed processing

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,320
uh written here that means that after

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,160
picking the cherries

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,559
of the coffee you put them um

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,080
to the developers so it will scratch the

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,160
skin out of the cherry

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,120
you will get rid of the skin and you

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
have the beans

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,280
covered by this uh pulp uh

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,919
sugar pulp then you will leave it in um

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,919
in

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,679
some water tanks for for example from 24

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,880
to 48 hours

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,440
and during this time there is the this

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
process

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,679
of fermentation and it depends

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
if the fermentation it's under water

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,799
with

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,160
less of oxygen or it's uh or there's

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,559
another method uh

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
natural process where you uh do not use

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,880
water and

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,280
just let the cherries uh sun dry so if

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
it's

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,000
happening on this on the sun and on the

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,520
air there's another part of

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
another type of fermentation another

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,400
type of microbes

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,360
and yeast is involving in the process

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,520
and this yeast and microbes during the

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,360
fermentation

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,919
will process the sugars in the in a pulp

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,039
and after that it will result in another

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,480
taste of the coffee

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,360
so if we after that after this um

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,400
this scratching of the pub then letting

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,600
the experiment in the

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,799
underwater then drying and then sending

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
to the roastery

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,000
in the roaster when we roasted the

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,159
coffee we

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,480
tasted it it's called cupping so we cop

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,760
it cop it cup

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,760
and after that we like a team in a

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,679
roastery

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,200
just decide what to write here so this

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,720
is not like

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
also it could be a little bit different

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,760
if same coffee will

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,679
roast another roaster will follow

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,240
another type of roasting process

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,320
then the resulting taste will be

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
different so it can happen that

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
from the same farmer two different

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
roasters would

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,880
have another descriptor so we call this

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,240
descriptors

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,280
and it says these are natural uh

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,600
ways how the coffee should taste

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,799
if you taste it regularly and if you

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,440
taste it uh

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,000
with someone who who can follow this

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
taste

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,320
you can learn it it's not something you

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,600
have to be like born for

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,679
uh as more you taste as more you can

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,559
feel that makes a lot of sense

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,600
um yeah no it actually i hope so

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,280
honestly it's one of the better

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,159
explanations of that whole process that

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,320
i've ever had

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,600
so i really appreciate that a lot um

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,679
there's been some more questions that

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,600
have come up around brewing methods and

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,919
i wanted to drive back towards brewing

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,000
um somebody was asking specifically

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,120
what's your coffee to water ratio for

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,760
v60

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,240
but also uh your recommended ratio but

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,320
also

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,080
how does that change for different kinds

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,200
of brewing methods or is the ratio

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,200
relatively fixed

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:55,600
uh i would say that i would fix the

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,120
the brew ratio for all alternative

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,720
methods so let's say we have some brew

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,159
ratio for espresso

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,400
and everything else every brewing method

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,799
and doesn't matter really if it's the

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,080
full immersion or if it's a pour over

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,720
i would recommend to stuck with the same

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,880
60 grams per 1 liter of water this is

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,039
what we call golden standard it was

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,640
established in 60s and then later

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:24,400
again in 90s there was two big um

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,720
how to say it like part of tasting

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
and it was established that this is the

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,039
the best

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
ratio which which uh people like to to

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,000
taste not

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,200
just the professional who prepare the

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
coffee but

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,000
like a general public so i would stuck

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,799
with the same ratio for everything and i

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,880
would just

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,320
counted how much of the coffee i would

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,440
like to prepare

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
and definitely it will it will result in

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,840
another taste if you add

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
or if you um decrease the amount of the

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,240
coffee

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
as more coffee you use per same amount

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
of

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,840
water the taste will be somehow stronger

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,280
but there is the trick that that

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,840
you can you can dilute the

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,880
amount of the coffee in just some part

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,120
of the water so

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,000
if if you have some part of water and

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,960
the coffee

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
and if you are increasing the amount of

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
the coffee

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,760
there won't be enough of water to dilute

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,960
it so

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,320
basically if for example you are using

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,000
let's say that my my uh it was 15 to 20

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,720
250 and if i would put there

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
as i suggested for this bypass 30 grams

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,280
of coffee

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,760
i would i would be afraid that it

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,400
wouldn't

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,760
dilute it enough and that you are just

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,080
wasting your coffee

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,480
and the taste of the coffee won't be

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,679
better of the brew uh it would be just

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,919
it wouldn't it wouldn't be

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,520
stronger because there's not enough

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
water to pull the taste out of the

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
coffee it actually paradoxically be

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,120
weaker

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,200
okay um and you're saying 60 grams per

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,679
liter of coffee

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,240
okay yeah so 15 to 250 becomes sorry

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,320
it's

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,559
i've only had one cup this morning so i

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,880
was unable to do that math quickly in my

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,240
head without talking through it out loud

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,000
oh this is my second so well we're

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
coming up on the end of our time here so

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,360
i'll ask you two quick questions which

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,440
hopefully uh

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,960
will be easy to answer the first is um

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,520
there's been some conversation around

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
reusable filters and the aeropress

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
um and i presume reusable filters and

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
some other methods do you have an

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,679
opinion

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,960
on reusable filters at all good bad

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,679
we were just we were tested tube types

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,120
one was made of cloth

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,080
and second one was made from

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,240
metal filter and i actually i had a

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,600
better result with the metal filter but

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
it was really special one

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,919
which was two layers on the top so the

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,520
the result was almost the same like

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
from the paper filter so i would

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,760
recommend this

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
uh i'm i'm not sure about the brand who

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,400
is making it but it was some japanese

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,679
uh factory who produced this kind of

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,159
filter it was like the

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,799
two layers of the metal filter connected

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,000
with uh

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,000
some some metal rim and i would uh

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
suggest it to use it if you are really

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,760
considered with the

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,240
with the zero waste but on the other

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
hand

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,760
the paper filters you can also put it

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,200
you can compost it you can

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,360
put it to your composting no that makes

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
sense

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,679
um and then the last question and then

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,120
we'll we'll say idea and let everyone go

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,919

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:47,039
