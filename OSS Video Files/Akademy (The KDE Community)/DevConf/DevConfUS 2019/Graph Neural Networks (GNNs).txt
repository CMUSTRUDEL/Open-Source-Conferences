	Speaker: Francesco Murdaca

The human brain has many capabilities thanks to its network structure that allows transferring information among neurons in order to perform a specific action or multiple actions. Using Machine Learning (ML) we are focusing on the learning capability, but the brain uses its network also to store information in the memory.

Nowadays many fields (e.g. medicine, biology, security, space) rely on graph structures to store data with semantic and context specific to that domain. 
Graph neural networks (GNNs) allow machines to learn from this kind of structure, taking a little step closer to mimic the behavior and architecture of the human brain.

In this talk, we will explore this type of neural networks that take graphs as input, showing their capabilities, issues and applications.
