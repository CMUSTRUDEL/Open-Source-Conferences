SEUSS is custom operating system we spliced into the backend of a high throughput distributed Serverless platform, Apache OpenWhisk. SEUSS uses an alternative isolation mechanism to containers, Library Operating Systems (LibOSs). LibOSs enable a lightweight snapshotting technique. Snapshotting LibOSs enables two counterintuitive results: 1) although LibOSs inherently replicate system state, SEUSS can cache multiplicatively more functions on a node; 2) although LibOSs can suffer bad "first run" performance, SEUSS is able to reduce cold start times by orders of magnitude. By increasing sharing and decreasing deterministic bringup, SEUSS radically reduces the amount of hardware and cycles required to run a FaaS platform.
