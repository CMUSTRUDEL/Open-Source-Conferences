Title: Auto-Healing Databases for Developers and Administrators
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Matthew Ward

When uptime is critical, how do you build a self healing database? Let us demo how Couchbase and OpenShift can form a self-healing and fault tolerant data-as-a-service. We will fail, scale, deploy and rebalance a Couchbase Cluster with the OpenShift Operator Framework automatically. The application remains available and continues to write data without disruption. Attendees will walk away with the know-how and documentation for deploying the operator and configuring their cluster for this database-as-a-service.
