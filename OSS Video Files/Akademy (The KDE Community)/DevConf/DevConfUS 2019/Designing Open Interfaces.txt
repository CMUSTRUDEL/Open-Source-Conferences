Title: Designing Open Interfaces
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: Rachael Phillips, Gina Doyle, Brie Mignano

Open source design systems are becoming increasingly popular and with good reason. They enable more consistent and efficient development, helping teams build better product experiences faster. With them, we can improve user experiences by documenting use cases and ensuring the patterns are both universal and adaptable. Designing in the open promotes transparency, collaboration, and inclusion within design. So what is an open source design system, and how can you leverage one to make your life easier? In this workshop, members of Red Hat's design system, PatternFly, hope to cover all your burning questions: - Learn how to improve user experience and speed up both design and development - Get an overview of PatternFly and learn how our team collaborates with the greater community across design and development - Learn how challenging product requirements can be easily solved for by contributing to an open source design system

I am an interaction designer Red Hat on

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,030
the uxd team I'll let these guys

00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,160
introduce themselves I'm Gina

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,180
I'm an interaction designer on the UFC

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:21,320
team as well I'm Rachel I'm an

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,669
interaction designer on the UX team so

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,560
we're gonna be talking to you guys a

00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:27,430
little bit about pattern fly today and

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,760
designing in the open

00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:33,550
so just as a note this is the first talk

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,230
in a series of Heine fire-related talk

00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:40,239
so we definitely encourage you to attend

00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:43,000
the the ones later on today and just

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,100
quickly to over the agenda we're gonna

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,660
do a bit of an introduction and go over

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,699
what open source it is I'm sure a lot of

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,500
you are familiar with the IDI ready but

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,000
we'll also go over Design Systems and

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,820
then talk a little about a little bit

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,910
about pod and fly why you should use it

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,530
how it works how you can use it and then

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:08,650
we'll have some final takeaways for you

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:12,570
guys so Jan is gonna kick us off so as

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,159
many of you have been contributing to

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,780
and probably already know open source

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,909
the definition is written on the screen

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,710
but I'm gonna read it anyways it's

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,110
denoting software for which the original

00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:26,830
source code is made freely available and

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,170
may be redistributed and modified so

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,340
there's many benefits to open source but

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:36,730
some of them are flexibility and agility

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,320
as well as cost effectiveness culture a

00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,350
culture of collaboration and

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,940
transparency and then better access to

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,880
innovation

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,590
there's other areas where open-source

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,710
principles are applied other than just

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,560
software and those can include hardware

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,630
and digital services like video

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,380
streaming services and then some

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,530
research areas as well that within the

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,500
software fields github which I'm sure

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,649
most of you have used is a widely known

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,170
and used example of open source in which

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,510
a massive community has evolved trim and

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,730
it's primarily used for code although

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,180
it's a great place to host an entire

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,220
design system and since it's an open

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,020
area where the community can see and

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,820
contribute to it the design system can

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:31,150
get constant feedback and grow as it

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:35,280
goes so now design systems in general so

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:40,330
what the design system the involved

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,690
components and other smaller modular

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,760
elements that I used to create a UI so

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,640
here I'm giving some examples of

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,209
existing design systems that one on the

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,819
left is Google and they use in the

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,799
design system on the Left you'll see

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,450
that there is that snapshot with the

00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,370
purple highlight and then on the right

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,840
there's one with the red highlight and

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:07,200
that just that is an example of some

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,629
product differentiations that come from

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,340
the original elements that they use

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:15,780
within the design system and then each

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,969
product that has its own flavor the

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,219
bottom one is Apple so there you can see

00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:22,109
all of the elements that they use to

00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,739
create a larger UI like the emoji

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:29,400
keyboard the switch a copy tooltip

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,829
and then the top one is IBM and they use

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,620
the carbon design system and that is a

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,079
third snapshot of all the elements

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,439
combined but if you can imagine each

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,750
section is is introducing different

00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:49,590
information but it all looks consistent

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:52,560
and has a similar feel so Red Hat has

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,419
its design system that it uses across

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,790
its products and it's called pattern

00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,799
play it's an open source design system

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,459
built to drive consistency and unify

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,799
teams and it provides design

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,629
documentation components and code

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,629
examples for users to build responsive

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,889
and accessible user experiences so some

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:15,080
of those components I've shown on the

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:17,150
right here drop down menu some buttons

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,190
there's also some chips that become a

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,810
shift group down there and then we would

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,730
use those components to build the stain

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,740
on the left and you can just see some

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:31,370
similarities there just from those

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:33,020
examples so I'm gonna now go into why

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,430
you would use VAT and buy and give some

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,700
specific reasons that and they get

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,730
pretty cool so our design system is

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,920
modular and flexible and modular design

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,990
systems enable you to take very isolated

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,150
patterns and combine them to build

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,180
complex designs seconds for different

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,760
user tests modularity helps ensure

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,070
consistency what you'll see across all

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,330
the Philippines I show and since the

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,980
isolator pattern shouldn't change much

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,650
between the context you'll see that

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,660
those similarities carry on so the

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,120
layout specifically here layout

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,040
structure the layouts pattern fly offers

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,610
help you easily organize and arrange

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,380
these components on a page and we supply

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,840
you with the documentation like I said

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,300
before of how exactly to use those

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,370
components in your application and it

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,590
ultimately improves your workflow and

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,240
gives you more time to think about the

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,240
higher level aspects of your application

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,750
so everything is responsive and when we

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,630
design we always design mobile first a

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,860
little difficult to see but you can see

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,850
with different break points that we

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,770
offer in pattern fry and the cool thing

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,450
is that all the components are built to

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,390
be responsive and designers and

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,700
developers can rely on the CSS to define

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,550
that Bolivia so like I said these are

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,860
the breakpoints and as the screen will

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,960
get smaller some of the design will

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,050
change which is why we offer these up

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,880
front and again that will supply you

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,560
with more time to concentrate on other

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,870
aspects of your application so another

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,480
thing big thing is accessibility so in

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,820
addition to modularity flexibility and

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,640
responsiveness our design system is

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,770
accessible and designs are evaluated to

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,110
consider all the ways a user might

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,050
experience the component so the

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,840
component so that the design is solid

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,750
before we develop it so semantics and

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,970
visual representation are decoupled

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,220
allowing the component to use semantic

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,950
elements that fit the context of the

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,630
component an example that of that would

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,790
be

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,040
an accordion which I'm not showing here

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,570
but the heading level and an accordion

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,690
should be based on the heading level

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:53,870
that comes before it and then for like

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,550
actions and a menu they might be links

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,680
to other pages or buttons that open a

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,000
modal our CSS styles are also

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,690
programmatically check for accessibility

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,340
violations and if we're interested in

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,680
learning more about accessibility we're

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,360
having another talk after this that

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,550
we'll go into a more deep dive about

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,530
that so lastly within our design system

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,240
everything maps to the variable system

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:25,540
so we have obviously that team is

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,640
composed of designers and developers and

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,740
we have a design library that they're

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,260
able to use which you see a little bit

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,750
of on the left and we break it down so

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,570
it matches directly with a variable

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,240
system so it was created to parallel the

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,390
CSS so not only does that make it easier

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,320
for designers to design but it also

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:52,070
allows designers and developers to talk

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:55,520
and communicate on a more more the same

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,920
level and all of the colors name color

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,600
names for example here will match with

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,750
the variable name that's listed on the

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,750
right

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,620
so now I'm gonna give it off to breathe

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,270
to talk about how patterns I works great

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,740
so now we're just gonna take a little

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,370
bit of a deeper dive to look at how to

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,960
fight in action so just to start going

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,590
to the floor a bit more so we all know

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,420
how this works so this is just a quick

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,430
flow that shows the general process we

00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,110
go through to add to climb fly and to

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,480
keep the design system updated and

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,640
constantly evolving so firstly a feature

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,590
requests then we go through a little bit

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,730
of a discovery phase after that we'll

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,160
pass off to design and we'll actually

00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,570
build the component out and of course we

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,210
have to implement it which is the final

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,740
step

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,540
okay so the first step is feature of

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,120
mice and their various ways that

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,920
requests come in to pattern pipe each

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,190
type of request generally follows the

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,560
same design contribution flow so the

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,720
first kind is sound trim adoption and

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,580
this is when a when someone might have a

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,700
component that's already designed in

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,220
another product but it's not yet exist

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,810
in pattern fry so that request will come

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,420
in to add that component to time fly for

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,860
others to use we also get completely new

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,900
feature requests which are similar to

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,130
downstream adoption except that the

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
component doesn't exist in another

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,850
product nor does it exist in pattern

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,160
play so with this type of request the

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,000
design is added to product and the

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,130
design system simultaneously

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,230
and then we also have enhancement so

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,230
this kind of request comes in when we do

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,610
have a particular component in time fly

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,890
but for example maybe a new use case

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,360
comes in that requires an addition to

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,700
the component to make it more flexible

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,040
so we can use in different contexts

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,140
so for example if we wanted to add a

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,640
multi select option into a component

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,640
that was previously single slabs

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,959
so after unit is your question we go

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,610
through a little bit of a discovery

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,730
phase to learn more about what's

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,749
actually happening so we dig deeper into

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,910
some of the use cases and the

00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:00,100
requirements and this is a multi-step

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,540
process that does involve looking at it

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,639
from multiple perspectives to make sure

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,230
that we're trying we build a

00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,529
well-rounded component that can be used

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,850
across multiple products and contacts so

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,799
first we'll do some background research

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,649
to get a feel for what already exists so

00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,790
for example there's navigation on the

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,769
right hand side of the screen here so

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,019
say you want to add navigation to the

00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,209
design system we have some questions

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,559
like how common is this we know this is

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,549
pretty common I'm sure most of you have

00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:30,879
seen navigation from red hakam to Gmail

00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:33,249
it's a pretty frequently used component

00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,910
are they already existing conventions

00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,889
for this

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,329
there's definitely are so we don't want

00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:39,910
to reinvent the wheel and create a

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,790
navigation that is confusing or that

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,019
doesn't work the way people expect it to

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,259
so we also want to look at what products

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,999
would use this how it works and you'll

00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,699
notice that navigations work pretty much

00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:55,769
the same across things except they do

00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:58,410
vary in color or theme animations

00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,820
typography things like that

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,560
and then once we know a little bit more

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,410
about the background we want to look at

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,480
use cases so for example if we take this

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,030
other component the selection drop-down

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,710
right there in the center that might be

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,990
needed across a wide variety of products

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,520
in context so for example we could use

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,800
that in a form we could use in filters

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,850
am i up here in a toolbar so we need to

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
make sure we're taking all those use

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,920
cases into account when we're building

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,060
this out and then finally after we've

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,710
kind of dug into this a little bit more

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,570
we didn't come up with requirements that

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,900
way we have sort of a vision going

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,280
forward with this component so it's

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,200
important to consider here which

00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,840
functionalities are non-negotiable for

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,270
this component and which if any

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,370
enhancements should also be included so

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,770
this last example in the bottom here is

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,220
an alert in that case we might can we

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:50,670
might say that a title and a description

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,230
are required elements but enhancements

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,170
might include allowing people to change

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,870
the color the icon maybe adding a call

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,250
to action or a dismiss button or maybe

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,460
even changing the amount of time before

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,510
that alert dismisses and goes away and

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,430
the cool thing about being open source

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,800
is that we can host a variety of

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,210
channels to have these discussions so we

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,040
make sure we do get those multiple

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,200
perspectives to build out this big wall

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
round component and those are all

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,390
available for the community to

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,390
participate in

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,110
so after discovery of course we need a

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,830
design this we need to know what the

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,210
component looks like how it behaves

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,250
our team will often you sketch to build

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,660
up components and this was mentioned a

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,060
little bit earlier but we have a sketch

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,220
library that developers and designers

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,690
could use but it has a library of all of

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,550
the component in pattern flies so you

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,940
can easily pick out those components you

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,040
need and build out a full screen these

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,260
designs also includes schematics in

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,650
context mocks and a variety of specs you

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,990
can see a toolbar the top one is it all

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,970
SPECT out using our spacing system in

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,110
pattern fly and below it you can see it

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,180
without all those spacers and how it

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,970
might look book right before you throw

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,930
it into a product some designs also

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,370
require a little bit further

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,830
documentation so we might have a

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,380
detailed write-up including when you

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,060
should use it how you should use it what

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,700
it looks like in context how it responds

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,860
on mobile how it may or may not interact

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,050
with other component so trying to really

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,420
give any users of this component a good

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,940
idea of where it lives and how it should

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,190
interact there and all of these designs

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,680
are shared and reviewed in our bi-weekly

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,120
plan flight demos those are also open to

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,770
the community and we do record them and

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,939
host them on our youtube channel so we

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,229
encourage you to check that out

00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:34,549
but again this process just really helps

00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,079
to see the design through multiple

00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,549
lenses and make sure that we're

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,579
addressing as many needs and use cases

00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:41,839
as possible and the last thing about

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,579
design too is that it's important to

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,189
remember that none of this is set in

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,839
stone it's not unchangeable we often get

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:50,599
like I said earlier bug fixes or

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,919
enhancement people open PRS on our

00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:54,019
github to make sure that these

00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,239
components are always being updated and

00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,879
that can mean addressing new use cases

00:13:56,239 --> 00:14:00,649
or like maybe fixing strange behavior

00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:05,539
that we didn't foresee the first time

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:08,659
around and so the last step in the

00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:10,249
process is development so for pattern

00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:13,399
play we do create components in both

00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,809
HTML CSS and react and it's pretty cool

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,179
on our site you can interact with the

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:19,369
components to see how they work and see

00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:21,169
them in different contexts and draw the

00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:22,669
stage that is communication of course

00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:24,289
between the developer and designer to

00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:26,749
make sure the component is being

00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:28,970
developed as desired sometimes things

00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:31,579
will come up and it might require more

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,139
design work and go back to figuring out

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,489
what it should look like and if it

00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,519
should work a different way than we

00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:39,439
initially thought sometimes it's a

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,169
technical limitation or maybe an

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:44,899
unaddressed use case but often work

00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,819
together to adjust that issue so while

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,349
the flow diagram does look linear

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,599
there's always opportunity to take a

00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:53,140
step back and sort of refine any

00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:55,120
previous work that we've done

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,220
this implementation also is shared in

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,210
our bi-weekly pad for downloads are

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,430
shared on github

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,250
I mean her tell you to take a look at

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,600
that and contribute if you'd like yeah

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,370
now that we've covered the flow we're

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,560
gonna get into a little bit of how you

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,280
could use patent fly and maybe

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,280
contribute to it

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,600
great thank you so much Regina and

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:22,650
breathe so how can I use pad and fly

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,370
we're gonna walk through the use case

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,380
today of implementing a table so at

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,520
first gonna think through a time you've

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,320
used a table you've implemented a table

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,560
and think about some features or

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,200
elements that were included within that

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,840
table design you probably fall within

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,820
one or two path pathways when you need

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,040
to implement this table which is you

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,530
have a design that was delivered to you

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,150
by a designer or you have no design you

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,650
may be a designer and you need to

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,430
implement a table that has certain

00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,430
requirements

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:03,400
all right so to illustrate this today

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm going to jump right into our website

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,700
start here

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,010
hungry

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,470
all right so a little bit about pattern

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,690
play what we're on pattern forks are key

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:58,610
for right now and this is getting

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,610
started for designers

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:12,100
hang with me inside try to NAV on our

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:14,470
mirror screen here so with the designing

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:18,669
one pattern ploy we provide a variety of

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,890
resources so for starters we'll go ahead

00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,829
and introduce the design system to you

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,959
and how it works if you arm or if

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:28,150
there's a design mind we offer the

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,330
sketch library and here we're offering

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,789
our components in full design as you'll

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,690
see in our design system today to be

00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:40,750
pulled from and ready as reference later

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,570
for developers and then also we have

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:48,070
several things we'll cover within our

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,770
design system so I'll try we'll look

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,140
quit trying to NAV true on the mirrored

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:57,549
screen here but we have styles which

00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:01,029
really gets into the colors and the

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:05,740
variable system that we offer as well as

00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:07,630
icons type of ography within our icons

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,120
page there's a plethora of things to

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,490
pull from that really keep your

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,799
application standardized and these are

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,480
really great concepts to become aware of

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,970
whether you're of the design or

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,919
development background and it's a really

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,169
great foundation that's a great starting

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,590
place for digging into these deeper

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,419
concepts around components so I but

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,549
whether you're designer and developer I

00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:35,269
really encourage you to go ahead

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:37,929
and get get familiar with designing with

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:37,929
Adam five

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,929
all right

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,049
yeah

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,480
I think I just have to go back to the

00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,480
duck

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:23,600
yeah that's great okay so I'll stick to

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:28,610
the slides so I really encourage you to

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,670
explore pattern 5 org slash v4 within

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,730
our design guidelines we really detailed

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:38,330
the usage in the usage and behavior of

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:41,240
the table so whether it's what this will

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:45,740
walk through or certain examples for the

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,180
table and the the different usage and

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,470
behavior patterns that we would

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,450
recommend for the table so they'll be

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,340
even in this particular use case you see

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,680
there there's a label one two three on

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,040
the website you'll see that we really

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,900
break down the anatomy of the table so

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,530
at this point in time you're learning a

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,520
lot about how this could be potentially

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,020
implemented and things are great

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,130
conversations to have from the beginning

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,860
with your developer if you are of the

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,929
design mine

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,360
okay I mentioned the sketch library

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,100
there's a handy link here but again it's

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,200
on the design guidelines and the website

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,120
super easy to download it and if you

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,289
don't use sketch no problem at all we

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,929
have plenty of resources available all

00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:33,490
right so the design table design has

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,220
been delivered after you explore those

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,140
design guidelines and you read more

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,460
about the usage and behave you're able

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,919
to understand the requirements and

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,710
interpret that for your table design

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,380
then you'll want to access the

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:52,960
documentation on our website so this

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,730
documentation again covers HTML react

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,130
and you can go ahead and follow along

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,409
here this is really the the cool

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,190
materiality stuff that makes the table

00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:05,620
possible so at this point in time we've

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,760
we've set you up with success here if

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,630
you're using in your app you have across

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,760
and more detailed documentation you

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,039
could also because we're open source

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,019
peek into our github and learn more

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,350
about the lifecycle of this table and

00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:23,700
how it arrived here and go ahead and

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,700
pull the code and get going

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,620
all right so yeah I think the minions

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,110
Illustrated best this concept of

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:36,220
collaboration but this is something that

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:38,610
the pattern play team holds dear to us

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,320
because that is how we make our

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,560
components accessible modular and

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,990
flexible across all of our products that

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,770
were servicing trying to make them as

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,570
universal universally usable as possible

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:55,180
so as you're implementing your table

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,820
it's imperative that the designer and

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,960
developer communicate which I'm sure

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,960
you've all learned over time

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,200
and through this collaboration you know

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:08,570
it's not always the picture-perfect

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,120
story you might run into a bug we try to

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,070
fix bugs as quickly as possible and our

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,780
community is very active about filing

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,460
them when they need Joe so we'd

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,370
encourage you to do the same here I've

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,040
linked to our HTML and CSS repo and re

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,930
act repo should you start using pattern

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,180
play and it need to file a bug we're on

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,640
it we're just feeding through those bugs

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,400
as quickly as possible and let us know

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,560
if it's something that's blocking you so

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,560
we could address it more quickly

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,920
all right into some of implemented if

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,630
you have design questions you you can

00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,950
work with your designer and if that's

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,920
something you think our team can help

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,080
answer definitely reach out to us I'll

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,160
be going through a slide that talks a

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,870
little bit more how to get in touch with

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,610
us here in a second just for

00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,590
accessibility so even though our

00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,950
components are accessible and ready to

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:05,180
use once that gets into your application

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,740
that's when it will fall on you to test

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,870
accessibility within your application so

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,700
within accessibility guidelines that

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,750
would highly recommend getting up to

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,760
speed for how to go about that testing

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,470
and we're gonna be talking about that

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,590
later today I'm gonna talk this

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,000
afternoon so customizing fit features

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,730
not offered in powder fly and

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,920
contributed them back to the community

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,270
it is a design system which means you

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,990
might see there's the need for

00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,340
customization and if that's the case

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,350
we'd love to know a little bit more

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,920
about that and see if it's a good use

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,140
case to be used across many products and

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,030
go ahead and contribute them back

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,930
because this is an open source project

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,790
so thinking thinking about that I'll be

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,630
walking you through some criteria for

00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,880
what would make a great contribution

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,280
because we hope that you'll become

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,780
contributors or inspired to be after

00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,960
learning a little bit more about pod and

00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,960
fly

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,340
so a little bit about our design

00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,560
contribution workflow and timeline in

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,570
the discovery phase we're really asking

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,150
you but you become familiar with our

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,230
repos by filing an issue and telling us

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,690
a little bit more about your

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,790
requirements as well as posting any

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,040
wireframes

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:22,490
and as a team will come together with

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,540
you and we'll review those designs and

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,700
we'll talk about where that could

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,620
potentially live priority wise and

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,890
really what that time we're figuring out

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:34,290
about how it could live across products

00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,650
and if it will live across product as

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,630
well and maybe I should just more

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,960
generally say applications so we're

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:46,850
thinking about things both inside but

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,850
have an outside of Red Hat

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,040
in the design phase we're working with

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,980
you to kind of finalize those wireframes

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,980
into visual mock-ups and interactions

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:02,850
bugs will review that with the pattern

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:06,150
flight team an implementation will ask

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,490
you to be involved with the PR process

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,070
and reviewing those and will update

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,679
update the design is required during

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,590
development so we have we have a team on

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,720
our side and as you can contribute if

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,360
you're interested we hope we can support

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,730
you in whatever way that you need to

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,679
support as well as if you want to take

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,900
that contribution and run with it an

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,200
implementation we try to work with you

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,179
on that as well and finally this is this

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,669
is one of our most valuable parts of the

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,380
process is documentation so after that's

00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:40,260
been implemented and put online we

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,480
really do need these great design

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,809
guidelines that document behavior and

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,770
usage so at that point in time we'd love

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:53,010
to work with you to go ahead and update

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:55,679
the website with design guidelines that

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:58,950
talk about the usage and behavior of

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,470
that contribution that you're making

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,700
so if anything you've heard today

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,770
interests you and you want to learn more

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,910
there are several places you can reach

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:12,820
us we have our mailing list where we

00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:15,790
send out bi-weekly updates at the

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,680
minimum sometimes more slack if you have

00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,080
urgent questions I really encourage you

00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,690
to get in touch with us either on on

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,580
slack or our forum I've got we've got

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,320
our team in there every day answering

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,600
questions that may come up design or

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,610
development related so we'll find the

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,170
right channel for you and the right

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,730
place on the forum and you can kind of

00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,880
go ahead and plug into the community

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:39,160
there we have a pattern fly blog that is

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,490
hosted on our website and we update our

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,220
blog very regularly to make sure that

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:49,380
any changes that we're seeing that touch

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:51,220
the system are published and especially

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,590
highlighted if we think they'll be

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,230
important to the community

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,450
and finally our YouTube channel is

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:01,540
writes a series of demos that we host

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,430
every two weeks but those demos are on a

00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,070
blue jeans link a meeting link that's

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:09,130
open to our greater community we have a

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,410
lot of people attend outside of Red Hat

00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,940
and really want that greater community

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:16,150
to be there to hear what we're working

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,670
on and also we're gonna start hosting a

00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,130
monthly a community meeting that's more

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,810
of a town hall-style and it's gonna be a

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,520
great great time together from both

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,730
folks internal to Red Hat and out

00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,610
external to Red Hat as far as what

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,300
they're working on and how they've

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,300
approached pattern five

00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:41,799
and some PT takeaways today open-source

00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:44,109
is flexible and agile cost-effective and

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,659
collaborative design systems it carried

00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:50,169
over to product design to unify designs

00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:53,679
across products and pan-fry is an open

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:57,580
source design system our goal is to be

00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,249
consistent in to unify teams any

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,559
documentation you need is that pattern

00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:06,129
fly org slash v4 and I also encourage

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,989
you to check us out on github and the

00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:11,559
product pattern fly contribution process

00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:17,859
is open to you so at this point in time

00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:19,749
I will pass this off for questions and

00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:23,469
I'll just in case you weren't here for

00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:25,419
intros I'll just remind you that Jena

00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:27,249
Bree and myself come from a design

00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,959
background so we'll be answering both

00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:31,209
will be best again during design

00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:33,999
questions and if we don't know they

00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:37,749
answer to a more technical question we

00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:40,089
have in HTML and CSS on a react workshop

00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,769
later today so we'll defer to that but

00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:44,289
we are here for any of your questions

00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,499
that are more designed specific pattern

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,499
fly

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,260
sizing it

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,710
yeah absolutely um that happens with

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,260
having to fly every day so I do want to

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,600
I want to correct something that it's

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,090
not like sounds like you may have heard

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,810
and I might I might have mumbled like

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,960
something but you yeah yes the pattern

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:43,250
for components of our customizable yeah

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,890
yes and they're really meant to be

00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,530
thought of as like like a Lego system

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:51,290
building blocks so you can take one of

00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,540
our components and you you can customize

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,660
it to fit your needs it's just meant to

00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:59,380
be flexible that being said at times

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,760
we've heard that many products needed as

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,370
something of this component that we

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,320
weren't offering and that whenever no

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,440
issue is filed that's the conversation

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:13,070
we have every single time and which

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,810
makes for an exciting project and a very

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,630
fruitful project because you're really

00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,490
hearing out those requirements that

00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,580
might be coming on so at that point in

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:25,040
time we evaluate if that's something

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,320
that can be used by many people and many

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:31,040
contributors and if that is the case

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:34,430
that it can be used by by many folks who

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,590
are engaged with pattern pie and we

00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,660
think it will exist across many

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,700
applications then we'll go ahead and

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,090
bring that into the component itself and

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,090
build that out

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:56,120
yeah that's a great example so on our

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,809
website if you were to navigate to

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,450
alerts we had offered this alert and and

00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:05,390
when I say alert I'm talking about when

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,630
you see the alert icon and then maybe we

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:11,080
have some banner text around exactly

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,700
what what this older it would be about

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,309
we're already offering several several

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,919
variations but what was cleaner when we

00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:20,990
started implementing it in in different

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,330
products and users started implementing

00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:28,130
it in different products was that it

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:31,789
only worked in the context of like I'm

00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:34,730
gonna say like in my a traditional Larry

00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:36,529
sucking like toast I pop up and once

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,960
that we needed it in line and this

00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:41,120
dialing didn't quite work so we went

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,149
back in and we're a stylized it and

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,210
introduced a new variation a new example

00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:49,460
that would include different styling for

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,320
that inline alert so we're taking in use

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,080
cases like that all the time where we

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,730
find that something we thought even

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,409
think is a little bit more Universal it

00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,210
needs a little bit more tailoring so

00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:01,330
yeah those are great conversations to

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,330
have

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,370
just a note on that too there is another

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,039
example that we are going through

00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,659
actually currently is for looking at I

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,940
work on the open shift team in Red Hat

00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:18,179
so we're using pattern find where we're

00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,580
trying to make our console as consistent

00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,260
with pattern fly as possible and so we

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,380
do have a lot of list views in the

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,760
console and one thing that came up was

00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,890
pine flight does offer a variety of

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,020
tables and different examples you can

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,760
use fork selection you can have a number

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,530
of different filters textbox filters

00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,570
faceted filters a combination thereof

00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,100
global actions all these things that

00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,110
pattern pie offers sort of built into

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,640
that so we can use that customize what

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,070
we want in the tool bar that makes sense

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,520
with our table one thing we did come

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:49,200
across is that for example in certain

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,030
list views we might have hundreds and

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,740
hundreds of items and there might be

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,240
three of them that I care about most and

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,340
is there a way that I can go ahead and

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,380
favorite those so what we did is we

00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,850
opened a bug on the pattern play site

00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,919
and we said we would love the

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,539
opportunity to add favoriting to this

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,490
and is this something that you would

00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:06,990
consider to add to pattern fly is this

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,429
something other products see as well

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,110
wouldn't would this be used by the

00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,270
community or is this maybe openshift

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,059
specific so those are the channels you

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:17,700
know we have that conversation internal

00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,990
or external products teams can comment

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,549
on there and say this is something I

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,610
would want or I don't know about this

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:24,960
this maybe seems custom and that way we

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,370
can have that conversation about does

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,230
this belong and patterns right is this a

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,210
customization and sort of go from there

00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,919
so that conversation is ongoing and

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,410
we're working on fitting in tables now

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,000
so I think that's

00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,110
part of climbing flights at that

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,110
conversations I was open

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:52,340
Durga hadn't seen much of a petition of

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:55,220
people didn't say organisms in 2007

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,830
sketch microfiber didn't type thing or

00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,250
what she hadn't I'd recommend see read

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,250
calm

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,050
are you talking about like taking and

00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:18,580
it's like an entire existing console and

00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,580
really just applying pattern fly onto it

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:24,730
I can take this on um so I haven't quite

00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,279
see now but what I have seen is that

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:30,669
there's that desire that they want to

00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:33,579
make the switch but that's that's that's

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:35,829
the angle and what needs to be taken

00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:39,069
into consideration and in the short term

00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:42,279
is what are those main elements I could

00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:47,109
pull in immediately for that migration

00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:49,029
process so taking a step by step and we

00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:51,760
do have a migration guide on the website

00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:54,069
so even if your interests interested in

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,929
trying out one pattern flight component

00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:59,410
we may get recommendations there about

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:02,200
like really high touch parts of the UI

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,930
that would be good to try that out so

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,309
one would be perhaps a masthead and I

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,019
talked nav because that is a really high

00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:13,240
visibility place where you could

00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:15,910
potentially test usability within your

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,260
application and that migration guide on

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,240
the website goes a little bit more

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,069
deeply into that so we have a lot of

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,740
people we work with who want to get

00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:25,779
there eventually but we also recommend

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,640
that you don't try to take on too much

00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:29,920
at once we think that's free and then

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,960
also provide the supports in place to

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,960
migrate as needed

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,420
I guess if there are no more questions

00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,700
I'll wrap it up there and the three of

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,809
us will be here all day and probably

00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,190
throughout the next couple of days as

00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,099
well so if you guys have any more

00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,479
questions and feel free to approach us

00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,489
and also don't forget about the other

00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:07,509
three talks and the pine fly series so

00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:07,509
hope see you guys there

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,620
desertion

00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,310
