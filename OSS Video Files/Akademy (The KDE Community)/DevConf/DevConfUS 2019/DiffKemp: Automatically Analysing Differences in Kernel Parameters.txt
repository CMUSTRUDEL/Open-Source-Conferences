Title: DiffKemp: Automatically Analysing Differences in Kernel Parameters
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Viktor Malik

We present the DiffKemp project - a tool for automatic analysis of differences in the code between versions of the Linux kernel. The tool will help to partially automate checking of compatibility of kernel options (sysctl options, module parameters) and of the kernel ABI, which will make the process of the kernel development and deployment more efficient and reliable. The approach that we use is based on static analysis of the kernel source code, which makes sure that all program paths are covered. For syntactic comparison of the code, we transform it into the intermediary representation of the LLVM (clang) compiler. Moreover, we show how advanced formal methods can be used to prove an equivalence of semantics of programs even when the code is syntactically different.
