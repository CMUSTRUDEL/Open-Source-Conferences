Our SRE team manages many business-critical applications that run on top of OpenShift clusters. We are responsible for the pipelines that ultimately deliver managed OpenShift clusters to customers.

We require automation in order to manage all the associated dependencies and supporting services, for example, creating container registries, managing OpenShift secrets, configuring the policies in Vault instances, etc.

To this end, we have created Qontract, an automation GitOps framework that enables self-service for developers, and relies on GraphQL to ensure language independence.

We will demonstrate how you can use this framework to create resilient pipelines that translate PRs into idempotent commands that configure any supporting services.
