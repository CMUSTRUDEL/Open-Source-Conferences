Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Ulrich Drepper

Just having the tools to profile an application available is not enough to improve the performance. There are too many of these counters and only a few can be measured at any one time. One has to interpret the various counters in context. This all calls for a methodological approach. In this talk we will look specifically use an Intel CPU and the top-down method Intel specified to match their CPU architecture.
