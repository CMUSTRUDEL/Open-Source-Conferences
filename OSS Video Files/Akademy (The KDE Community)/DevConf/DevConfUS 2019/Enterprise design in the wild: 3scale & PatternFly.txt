Title: Enterprise design in the wild: 3scale & PatternFly
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: Amy Glass and Thomas Maas

Adopting common design patterns for a consistent user experience across enterprise software products is a challenging undertaking. Last summer, Red Hat's UXD team collaborated with the 3scale API Management team to adopt PatternFly, Red Hat's open source design system. PatternFly UI components, HTML code, and CSS styling provide standard behaviors and visuals across Syndesis and 3scale, both part of Red Hat Agile Integration. This talk focuses on how UXD collaborates with the 3scale team to migrate existing designs to PatternFly, how 3scale designers plan to contribute patterns to the open source design system, and how lessons learned drive PatternFly adoption into a more projects. It will deliver practical and useful takeaways for designing and delivering enterprise applications.

Dominic hi everyone my name is Amy I

00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,830
work at Red Hat I'm a UX design lead in

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:17,050
the middle of middleware portfolio at

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:19,630
Red Hat and Thomas I'm working alone in

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:24,820
the 3c office and they're on the UX lead

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:27,430
and I'm also managing our time and I get

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,930
their works are youing okay great yes so

00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:35,050
we'll get going so our talk is it's

00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,230
about how we how Thomas's team and our

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,719
team has worked together over the last

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,949
about a year and a half to bring

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:49,079
together the design of pattern plot of

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:51,789
three scale into a more cohesive UI

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,960
using pattern flight the design system

00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:58,479
so this talk really is for anyone who

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,120
has tried to coordinate and sort of look

00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,639
and present a similar and consistent

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,080
look you know sometimes it works out and

00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:08,159
sometimes it's kind of like well it's

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,159
closed it's closed

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,990
for us as user experience designers and

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,730
developers this is in a way a kind of a

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,880
Holy Grail

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,090
it's something that we've reached for

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,000
four years my former company most UX

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,510
designers who I talked with who work for

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,520
an enterprise in which applications are

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,450
developed across the enterprise by

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,020
different teams with different goals

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,850
different features but yet still trying

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,610
to look like they come from the same

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,350
place in the same company and obviously

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,470
we want to do that to make the users

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:53,280
experience one that is cohesive coherent

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,050
that makes sense and that is not jarring

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,060
when one is switching from perhaps one

00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,310
system to another which is behind the

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,380
seams to behind the scenes to separate

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,670
products but we want to make it look as

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,979
though it's all one cohesive unit and of

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,520
course that helps when sales teams go

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,800
out to demo the software it doesn't make

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,239
a lot of sense when you're demoing and

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,890
something pops up that looks just

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,650
completely different from everything

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,329
else in your set so how do we do this

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,650
well first of all we can recognize what

00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:30,000
challenges there are so first in in this

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,319
challenging Enterprise environment and a

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,069
few of these things I've already spoken

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,010
about too many applications that exists

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,170
already knowing in a large organization

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,019
what is going on outside of your group

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,239
what even inside your group is going on

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:50,220
with different members of the team

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,500
working on various projects teams have a

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,170
variety of technology stacks and

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,629
favorite tools that sometimes are

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,109
religious in a way in terms of their

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,780
adherence to tools legacy code it's hard

00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:06,419
to change its it takes time and it's

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,209
often not favored over new features by

00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,280
the business so businesses will often

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,530
you know if it ain't broke don't fix it

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,579
and so they will not tend to favor well

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,379
we need to align our UI our front ends

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:22,109
we have geographically distributed teams

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,300
which is a challenge from a

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:27,600
communication standpoint

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,610
and the teams themselves tend to want to

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,330
focus on what makes their particular

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,280
part of the project best-in-class

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:40,040
so how do we do it we kind of have to

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,910
two areas that we look at one is from a

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,190
external external to the company

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:48,990
standpoint marketing branding

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,630
storytelling that says hey this is an

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:55,170
integrated solution and using our

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,620
product will allow you to work in this

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,980
product and get your job done but from

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,590
an internal product design standpoint we

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,680
use what are called design systems and

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:11,670
obviously communication amongst the

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:16,620
teams now for Red Hat which is an

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:19,730
open-source software product open-source

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,870
project by their very nature are

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:26,190
community driven they're highly

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,350
innovative and they rely on different

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,540
technologies whatever the community is

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,180
working on they're not necessarily bound

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,610
by the need for a common look and feel

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,480
or a common behavior but when those

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,660
projects are then productized as Red Hat

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,230
products we then have to grapple with

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,320
how to make these look more look and

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,160
feel more the same or the more similar

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,919
particularly when actions are similar

00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,130
so for RedHat it became very obvious

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,919
that we needed a system a design system

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,480
to help us to take those kind of

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,030
projects that are out there community

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,470
driven and create a more common look and

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:14,160
feel so what is a design system a design

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,540
system at the highest level provides

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,570
guideposts and tools for creating a

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,260
consistent look and feel they come with

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,750
behavior guidelines and documentation

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:30,389
they include visual elements like fonts

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:35,979
icons colors they provide code elements

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:38,080
reusable HTML and style sheets and in

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:42,220
some cases frameworks JavaScript

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,310
framework and the design systems are

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,139
really our living entities they can

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,139
evolve they do evolve over time

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,220
and so as many of you have probably

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,760
heard if you attended any of the UX

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:01,150
talks yesterday our design system is

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,430
pattern fly pattern fly design system

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,410
has been around for a few years it is

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,350
supported by a team of designers and

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,510
developers it is community based it's

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,270
open for reviews feedback and

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:16,150
contributions from the community

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,980
it contains tools that do make design

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,590
the design process easier and

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,820
development easier including a sketch

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,670
symbol library HTML CSS sample code and

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,490
demo code react.js framework and

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:34,390
artifacts and the system is modular and

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:38,050
has built-in accessibility so I want to

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,530
just take a step back and talk to you a

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,720
little bit about some takeaways from a

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,380
survey that I read that was done by

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,180
figma which is a design system company

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:53,620
the survey was conducted last year

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,870
included about 500 participants they

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,670
wanted to see what kinds of themes were

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,960
emerging and best practices around

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:03,640
design systems the practitioners who

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,440
they interviewed came from a variety of

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,949
industries as you can see here

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,280
represented by their

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:14,939
their company logos from finance

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,939
education retail travel and others they

00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:22,080
used a mix of open-ended and multiple

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:24,509
choice questions and produced a document

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,939
that I linked to at the end and I wanted

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,759
to just reference a couple of these

00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:33,289
outcomes because they help to frame the

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,289
rest of this talk

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,290
so the first big takeaway is that design

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,650
systems are still in their infancy the

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:47,260
top chart that you're seeing describes

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,390
the current state of design systems for

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,640
the practitioners who responded and the

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,010
bottom chart represents an aspirational

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,700
where we would like to be if you look

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,960
from left to right the black is

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,380
representative of stage one

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,900
it's an undocumented effort the dark

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,230
purple stage two is documented but in

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,740
code only the kind of orange mustard

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:14,890
color is a dedicated design team and

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,900
then the light lavender is a system

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,850
that's publicly available so the big

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,120
takeaway here is from the top chart

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,220
about sixty percent of respondents

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,890
currently have undocumented or only

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,410
documented in the code of design systems

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:32,110
but if you look at the bottom chart

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,900
about 80 percent that orange and the

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,510
light purple bar would like for their

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,510
systems to be driven by a dedicated team

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,780
and to have documentation and to be

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,350
publicly available so in the case of

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,690
pattern fly our system is in its I think

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,310
it's in its second major public release

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,380
and it features a dedicated Design

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:59,640
Systems team and documentation to

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,640
support the the of the system

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,700
on the next the next question was what

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,690
stage did you start building a design

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,000
system and the key takeaway here is that

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,550
design systems usually arrive after

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,150
products are built whether they're

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,090
derived from the products or not in our

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:24,020
case with pattern fly it wasn't so much

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:27,980
a product or a project within RedHat it

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:32,240
was more of a built off of the bootstrap

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,910
framework and so that was how pattern

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,840
fly had its beginnings and for several

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:43,550
years relied on bootstrap in recent days

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,700
or in the past year so for pattern fly

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:49,760
for we've decoupled from bootstrap so

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,270
that is going to be helpful to us in

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:58,540
terms of innovation flexibility and not

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,540
being tied to that to their updates

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,480
[Music]

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,519
this chart looks at what are the

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,029
artifacts that are part of a design

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:11,000
system and almost 90 percent of the

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:13,850
respondents report using components and

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,459
symbol libraries about eighty-three

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:20,470
percent report that their design systems

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:23,329
include a style guide and around half

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,940
also mentioned content guidelines and

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,740
design principles one thing that's not

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,839
represented on the chart but that's in

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,940
this article is that several of the

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,980
respondents wrote in answers about code

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,680
artifacts and that seems to be an area

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,319
where people are really engaging to

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,389
provide more to developers in terms of

00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:43,910
what they need to actually implement

00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:47,389
these design systems so things like

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:51,250
react and mix-ins and token repositories

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:55,250
and iOS and Android artifacts and such

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,740
so happy to say that pattern fly is

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,060
really pretty far along in all of these

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,759
areas and is also concentrating on code

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,430
availability with a react j/s kind of

00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,080
gold standard implementation as well as

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,760
the HTML and CSS libraries

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,430
[Music]

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,360
and this was the last takeaway from the

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,670
survey that I thought would be

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,440
interesting to this group and the

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,510
question is does your does your company

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,310
let people diverge from the design

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:30,970
system and it does seem intuitive to me

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,070
that design systems must be flexible and

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,399
be able to breathe and grow over time

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,920
depending on how they're used it it

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,420
really feels pretty obvious that a rigid

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,940
adherence to an absolute design standard

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,690
for the kind of software projects that

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,300
we are engaged in will not allow us to

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:55,510
grow and innovate but at the same time

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,540
we have to balance that against how it

00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:01,660
is often challenging to work with teams

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,089
where there's particular opinionated

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,930
views based on individual preferences

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:09,310
and so we do rely at Red Hat on meeting

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,699
this challenge by leaning on our

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,410
research or use a research team by using

00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,959
the pattern fly design system and

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,600
obviously being willing to discuss and

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,250
work together in teams and evolve the

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,250
the standards over time

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:33,220
and then of course the design system

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,840
alone can't give you what you need the

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,880
enterprise when we talk about the

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:42,730
enterprise it's human at its core

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,650
so as I mentioned before and this is an

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,810
image showing us in a typical meeting

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,750
well maybe not so typical if we have a

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,480
we have a get a special guest in that

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,250
meeting but we do spend a lot of time

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,800
discussing and because we're

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,260
geographically distributed we use online

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,950
systems that allow us to to communicate

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,500
in conference calls and speaking about

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:10,690
and talking about how to evolve products

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:13,080
so that they will be more consistent so

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,910
that is as I've described existing

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,890
products alone are challenging within

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,260
Red Hat but when a new company is

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,090
acquired the challenge becomes even

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,630
greater and this is where I'd like to

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:29,140
invite up my colleague Thomas who is the

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,750
UX lead and man who is UX lead in

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,360
manager with Red Hat 3 scale API

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,170
management and 3 scale was acquired by

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,330
Red Hat in 2016 and Thomas is going to

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,290
talk to you about some details and

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:46,240
specific challenges that his team faced

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,790
working together with us trying to

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,330
integrate the three scale the system

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,330
with ours

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:59,690
thank you

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:01,780
so yeah Red Hat Freescale work before

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:07,280
they before we were bored by Red Hat

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:13,250
Swiss girls started in 2007 was founded

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:16,520
I joined the company in 2013 and the Red

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,960
Hat bought us in 2017 so so we joined us

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,580
the ugly duckling huh how aware this is

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,670
not really a duckling but you know this

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,400
image was rights free so it was funny

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,560
and anyway you know us ducklings always

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,310
have become beautiful swans so it

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,140
doesn't really matter yeah so we started

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,250
to like our company works like a pure

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,990
sauce that gives you a little bit of

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,910
complex like three scale is about API

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,450
management so it's like our customers

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,640
have an API and their customers want to

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,460
use their API and we help them with

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,180
everything around their API so later

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,670
developer portal ask money for your for

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:57,410
usage of your API and minutes apiece for

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:59,210
the applications etc etc some context so

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,520
we were SCI's only company so our first

00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,550
year and a half after right at the board

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,400
house was spent making an on-premises

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:09,290
version of our software so we could at

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,890
least also be sold as part of the

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,160
OpenShift

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:15,620
package of integrates the integration

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,390
products but still we worthy a little

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,020
bit of the like the ugly duckling in the

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,580
sense that we looked like this now we

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,100
did our best there to be integrated with

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,650
Red Hat by just saying a3 still by very

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,700
small and basically was it because we

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,000
didn't have time for anything anything

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:35,780
else at that moment in time until Amy

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,460
saw that no until all basically the time

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,670
was there we like we had a non-parent

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,180
product it was working and you know we

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,430
got feedback from sales

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,230
like every time that shows rescale it

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,430
looks like the customer was like okay

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,890
this looks like a different completely

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:55,270
different products I was then so we

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,770
needed to pay more with the rest off the

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,400
integration part which looked more or

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,980
less like for example fuse you know you

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,210
could say I mean it's white and black so

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,530
that's that's good there's some blue

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,320
that's good but there's some things

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,090
missing like so we have our like our

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,940
navigation is horizontal there at the

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,070
top and we have some black bar but it's

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,140
thinner and we don't have our product

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,510
name at the top we have at underneath it

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,640
right and so there were some other

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,150
things like this was our sign-in page at

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,250
that moment very minimalistic and this

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,750
was the refused to sign in page and not

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,030
just fuse also the other interracial

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,430
products and they all run within hope

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:37,180
and shifts which also looks the same

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,430
because also be using butterfly so we

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,160
had to get our product come to the

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,980
planet fly train

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,800
with a limited number of people with a

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,320
limited time frame you know we couldn't

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,620
just I mean the fiscal application is

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,900
it's many many many pages we don't have

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,180
an official design system we have

00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,830
tsunami in our code is not like one big

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,080
chaos there is organization to it that

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,910
there is no butterflies there's no sign

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,880
system so there are rules and there are

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,400
things but we have like things like to

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,930
do remove this crap but be aware that

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,700
you have to remove all the difficult

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,120
right and similar this kind of

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,190
stuff

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:21,090
so you know we have to be careful there

00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:24,660
so using slim for the templating of the

00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:26,580
HTML that's not a problem by itself on

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,630
the JavaScript from we were half we were

00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,370
also a little bit all over the place

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,730
because we try different things over

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,080
over over the years so we have some Java

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,250
mobile JavaScript you have some

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,260
CoffeeScript you have some es6 that's

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,760
some more things okay so we we looked at

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,610
it again we talked about some quick wins

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,350
we changed some cars we thought okay the

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,240
benefind is using fullscreen so that's

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,650
going to be like this okay that that was

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,360
like that was not much work then we

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,430
still have this at this problem for you

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,610
how we're gonna how we're gonna switch

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,370
to what what should we try to do what's

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,500
possible to do in a minute

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,090
time to make people feel to make our

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,770
customers their customers feel like

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,670
they're using just to get another

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:12,200
product off the iteration portfolio so

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,940
we thought about the most in your face

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,620
things are the navigation and then the

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:21,350
sign-in screen so that's what we focused

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:23,390
on and so but then it'll step back like

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,610
before that we were already thinking

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:29,630
about that our navigation like I told

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,190
you before we do API management and we

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,840
started with customers that only had one

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,400
API to manage but like there were more

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,140
and more customers with a lots of a few

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,460
guys diminished and our navigation with

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,040
four method in the sense that if you go

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,590
to your API s-- then you could click on

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,780
your own individual API but then if you

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,160
want to have the analytics of that API

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,220
you'd have to go to analytics and then

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,340
find that saying that I can imagine that

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,770
sorry

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,140
what we wanted was is more of an API

00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,700
driven navigation so within an API space

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,920
you would be able to do everything

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:04,010
related to that API so we already had

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,990
conversations about that in 2016

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,179
you just didn't have time to do anything

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,830
with it at that moment what we decided

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,460
to do was like combine that 105 vertical

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:16,100
navigation with a pretty deep

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,340
reorganization of our navigation and

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,779
that's what we did and nothing that's so

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,399
we try playing with that and this is

00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:27,590
still like the content it's not really

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:30,470
there because we have also two layers of

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:34,250
navigation with in Tenafly that would be

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,409
like this and then we found out we have

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,760
a problem and we don't have bread crumbs

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:43,190
meaning that if you'd navigate to

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,080
intelecom here then we disappear again

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,610
so you would have like no the person

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,980
being on the page would have no way of

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,519
knowing where relative to the other

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,830
pages he was in the system time we also

00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,299
knew that if I for was going in the

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,210
direction where there would also be

00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:01,460
vertical navigation but the the second

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,960
layer would be underneath it which would

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,100
be better for us because we've always be

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,510
visible we tried we tried breadcrumbs

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,850
but that didn't work out was too much

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,970
work we couldn't do it so we posted we

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,409
didn't merge it now we went here right

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,600
so we we borrowed a little bit of

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:20,840
planner fly for having better navigation

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,049
the secondary layer layer underneath in

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,610
the same vertical bar always visible so

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,179
that's another like diversion that we

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,150
did like

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,520
there is no

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,220
ethical was the hamburger you could not

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,279
like to remove it because then the first

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,539
these are our better arms wasting that

00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:43,080
was just being melodramatic about

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,080
implementing feather fly

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:55,210
you see we did pretty well we chase our

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,560
sign-in page to Luke also more in line

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,560
with the other products

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,100
have some takeaways so that's what we

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,440
did like start with the most in your

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:16,440
face differences I leave the rest for

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:18,780
later the second I'm not sure if this is

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,710
felon every project whether that tries

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,630
to adhere to a visual standard but we

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,430
use the visual alignment we're also

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,620
actually can make other more structural

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,450
improvements to the product so we could

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,600
when we launched this we could tell our

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,070
customers you know we made it different

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
because this isn't isn't this and it's

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:40,880
not just a different loop but there's a

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,170
reason to it behind them that helps

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,960
especially the SAS level for our

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:50,730
customers to appreciate the changes in

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,650
chromatic spirits nothing leather so

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,340
yeah right we should have had that

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:59,670
hamburger Ikey we should have by the

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:04,050
letter it's not correct there are it's

00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:06,780
not perfect 9 5 3 at this moment it was

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:10,380
not but that was not to get our goal our

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,960
goal was customers seeing one set of

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,590
favourite products and feel good about

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,590
that right

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:21,240
sorry fest so then we thought we were

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,980
done and of course then the pennant

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,270
fighting game with benefit for so if we

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,490
could start all over again

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,770
no no then then we have to find a way to

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,430
get Tenafly for to work and that's where

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,430
I get effective

00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:44,910
right so of course then the next version

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:48,960
came along and and we similar to how

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:52,770
Thomas decided to instead of just adding

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,250
the pattern fly three UI elements on top

00:22:52,770 --> 00:23:00,870
of the design instead of he actually

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:04,920
rethought the the ia of his application

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:07,350
and where things belonged we also

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,900
expanded our project instead of just

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,660
everybody moved to pattern fly for what

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,400
we're really doing is expanding on not

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:19,620
only three scale but other open-source

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:24,120
projects that are part of the Red Hat

00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:26,750
agile integration product line and so

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,800
that includes synthesis open source

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,740
upstream project which is fuse online

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,960
allowing you to easily create

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:41,310
integrations using camel routes epic

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,490
urea which is an API editor three scale

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:47,210
for API management and Kafka and

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,210
ActiveMQ for messaging

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:54,850
so our teams since about February I was

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,130
looking at the document we the uxd team

00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,230
along with some of the front-end

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,750
developers from these various projects

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,840
and products have been meeting on a

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,340
regular basis to talk about where are we

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,650
now to serve to get a lay of the land

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,540
where is everyone in these projects in

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,000
terms of pattern fly adoption and

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:16,330
pattern fly for adoption in particular

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,880
and how can we all move in this in a

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,100
similar direction around the same time

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,960
and around the same timeframe and so

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,670
that team has been meeting it's a

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,870
virtual team from across the

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:31,840
organization and we've basically laid

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:36,580
out kind of a roadmap for moving ahead

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,620
we have successfully migrated all of

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,620
those applications that I mentioned to

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,620
using the pattern fly for designs for

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,680
their masthead which is that header bar

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:51,670
the vertical navigation the about page

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,950
and the logon page so as Thomas said the

00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,290
in-your-face parts of the system or what

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,110
we commonly refer to as application

00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:02,650
chrome so it's the kind of surrounding

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,450
pieces so this particularly helps with

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,430
demos the sales team and the product

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,660
teams really like this because if

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,700
someone's demoing and they're just

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,770
flashing things up in front of users and

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,540
switching between their users not

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,580
necessarily or the audience is not

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,590
necessarily looking at all the details

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,630
so we figured if we do that first we're

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,630
kind of showing it's a good faith effort

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,670
we're moving in that direction now we're

00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,970
starting to dig into the content areas

00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,350
of the application and so our next the

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,280
part that we're working on actually now

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,890
is looking at lists cards and tables

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,349
because what we noticed is that those

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:41,079
three

00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:43,779
components are a good part maybe almost

00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:46,779
80% of what we show in those

00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:48,669
applications at the same time we're

00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,949
looking at some kind of vest folk or

00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:52,749
unique elements from the different

00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,549
applications to determine can these

00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:56,349
things be contributed back to pattern

00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,379
fly are there patterns that are existing

00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:01,509
that could be better used instead of

00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:04,599
those and so on and then as we move

00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:07,509
forward we plan to look into even

00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:10,569
additional content areas like toolbars

00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:13,539
fonts there was a big font change from

00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:18,959
pattern fly 3 to pattern 5 for buttons

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:21,369
forms and and other other UI elements I

00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:25,209
wanted to show you a couple of examples

00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:29,399
of you'll see the the spirit of the of

00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:32,829
the closeness of these if not the letter

00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:36,969
so this is three scale API management

00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:40,089
right now the main page and this is Red

00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:42,519
Hat views online as Thomas pointed out

00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,529
there's no hamburger here so we're not

00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:49,569
quite there yet but we're moving in the

00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:53,769
same direction the Red Hat logo is there

00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:55,230
the the Red Hat the Red Hat itself is

00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:59,020
there

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:01,570
the menuing system and the masthead

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,460
same with API designer which is part of

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,830
Red Hat integration and it doesn't have

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,919
a left nav this is just the Welcome

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:12,549
empty state page and then these are a

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:16,690
couple of examples of the about screen

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:22,659
for fuse online Red Hat API designer and

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:24,789
a MQ console I included a couple of

00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:26,309
links here at the end if you're

00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:28,630
interested in learning more about

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:32,350
pattern fly for open source design

00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:35,559
system please visit that link there's

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:39,090
lots of great information there you can

contribute at that location learn about

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:45,279
contributing to to the project there's a

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,070
link here to the figma survey that we

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,840
that I discussed earlier and also a

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,730
design systems publication if you're

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,870
interested in learning more about design

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,630
or design systems that is there on the

00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,909
list as well

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,740
so thank you very much and Thomas and I

00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:04,310
would be happy to take questions at this

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,800
time

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,800
[Music]

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,429
[Music]

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,649
if anyone has questions I'd like to ask

00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:20,450
that you raise your hand and try to move

00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:23,980
toward the aisles if possible so that we

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,980
can just quickly get the mic to you

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,570
just for clarification one of the

00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:43,160
components you said was content

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:45,320
guidelines can you elaborate on that

00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,510
I'm writer in content means one thing to

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,800
me pusher means something different to

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,800
you yes

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,610
we do have content guidelines we have a

00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:03,510
content management a person on our staff

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:06,630
of the uxd department who does a good

00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:09,240
bit of writing and on the pattern flyff

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,900
site itself which I'm not sure I can get

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,770
to because of this crazy thing but you

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:21,060
can look it up the content guidelines

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:24,950
include writing for you is how to you

00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:28,800
know things like voice consistent voice

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:31,530
terminology things to avoid that sort of

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:35,310
thing and they're pretty extensive I

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,780
think she did a great job so if you

00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,960
haven't seen those yet if you go to

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,800
pattern fly org to that last link

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,800
included

00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:47,070
which I guess I could try to do

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:08,080
writing voice and style guide

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,110
[Music]

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,540
so feel free to explore those those

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,020
parts of the website thanks for the

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,380
question

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,380
[Music]

00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,380
any others I have a question if we can

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:31,030
11th so you spoke a little bit about how

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,250
Kota code artifacts are an increasingly

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,750
important part of design systems that

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,740
people want to integrate more of that

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,690
into their design systems and that

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,560
having a common JavaScript framework is

00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:47,560
important to that I know that part of

00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,720
the transition from pattern fly 3 to

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,670
pattern play for was settling on a

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,870
single design single JavaScript

00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,760
framework I don't know if you could

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,720
possibly speak more to the importance of

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,720
that and how that ties in

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,340
did you catch the I'm not sure I caught

00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:10,010
all the details I think you're asking

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,010
about how we settled on react

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:17,940
the question sorry it was how you

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,149
settled on reaction how how you

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,039
determined that having that one

00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:26,299
framework as opposed to a few different

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,299
frameworks was important

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,010
yeah I don't know part of a kind of

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,320
flight team so I didn't but I'd say that

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,920
the coroner flies not really react it's

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,840
a separate

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,510
it's a separate get that request story

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,870
so you can only use HTML CSS and then

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:43,570
yeah I guess it's about like you want

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:47,440
one efforts to be really good and not

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,850
very different efforts to be like and

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,050
then you can still discuss of react it's

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,430
the right choice and I'm sure the people

00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,110
that would say yes and there's people

00:31:51,430 --> 00:32:01,240
ever saying no and maybe five years from

00:31:53,110 --> 00:32:03,820
now when Facebook is yeah I mean I I

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,810
agree with that and I think it I mean I

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,340
don't know if there's someone for here

00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,930
from from the pattern flight team who

00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,080
could speak to it more than I can my

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:15,340
impression is that it it came down to a

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,790
matter of resources and we do have a

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,980
design and development team dedicated to

00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:24,310
pattern fly but again there are only so

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,870
many and the need is great so and I

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,640
think there was a a good bit of

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,070
surveying done in the beginning is that

00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:34,180
right Rachel a good bit of surveying

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:36,730
done across not only our enterprise but

00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,730
across the industry to kind of come to

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,350
that agreement on react as being kind of

00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,350
the gold standard framework but again

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:46,630
like Thomas said the core there's the

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:51,270
core library which contains all the HTML

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,270
and CSS that is available to you

00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,940
