	Speakers: Amy Glass and Thomas Maas

Adopting common design patterns for a consistent user experience across enterprise software products is a challenging undertaking. Last summer, Red Hat's UXD team collaborated with the 3scale API Management team to adopt PatternFly, Red Hat's open source design system. PatternFly UI components, HTML code, and CSS styling provide standard behaviors and visuals across Syndesis and 3scale, both part of Red Hat Agile Integration. This talk focuses on how UXD collaborates with the 3scale team to migrate existing designs to PatternFly, how 3scale designers plan to contribute patterns to the open source design system, and how lessons learned drive PatternFly adoption into a more projects. It will deliver practical and useful takeaways for designing and delivering enterprise applications.
