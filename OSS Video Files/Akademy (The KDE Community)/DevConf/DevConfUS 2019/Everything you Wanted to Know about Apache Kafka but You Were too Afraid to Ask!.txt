	Speaker: Ricardo Ferreira

Streaming platforms have emerged as a popular, new trend, but what exactly is a streaming platform? Part messaging system, part Hadoop made fast, part fast ETL and scalable data integration, with Apache Kafka at the core, streaming platforms offer an entirely new perspective on managing the flow of data. This talk will explain what a streaming platform such as Apache Kafka is and some of the use cases and design patterns around its use. Moreover, this talk will also present and answer a set of random -- but recurring -- questions from the community about Apache Kafka.
