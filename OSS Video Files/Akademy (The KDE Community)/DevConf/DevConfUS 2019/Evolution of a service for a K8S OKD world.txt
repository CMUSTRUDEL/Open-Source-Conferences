Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: John Mulligan and Raghavendra Talur

Heketi is a storage volume manager service for Gluster in environments like Kubernetes/Openshift. In the course of the last few years, as maintainers of this project, we have learned about the difference in usage patterns in the container orchestrator world as compared to traditional unix server. The events a traditional system sees in a year, software running in orchestration can see in a week. The volume of activity and the volatility of the environment are all amplified. In this talk, we will walk through the challenges encountered and the solutions we developed to stabilize Heketi running within an orchestration environment and how many of these lessons can be applied to other software.
