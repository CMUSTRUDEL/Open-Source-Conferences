Title: CI CD 101 Workshop
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Michael V Thanh

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. With a rapidly growing industry means rapidly growing teams and changing code - subsequently the industry has a growing need to increase velocity, collaboration, and quality of their codebases. CI/CD enables this, and more, as developer & operations teams break down unnecessary silos to gain deeper knowledge of how the entire pipeline flows from development to deployment.

In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI/CD and have the opportunity to reinforce what they've learned in a hands on workshop featuring the CircleCI platform.
