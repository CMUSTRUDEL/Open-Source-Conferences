Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Micah Abbott

Fedora Silverblue is a variant of Fedora Workstation powered by rpm-ostree, Flatpak, and container technology. It provides fearless, transactional upgrades of your OS and a clear separation of your host and applications, but still maintains the ability to customize your host as you see fit. Would you like to learn more?

This talk will discuss the background of Fedora Silverblue and its supporting technologies, while performing live demonstrations of the OS. I'll show you how to get up and running with Flatpaks, what it looks like to build and run containers using podman, and how to customize the base OS using package layering. I'll demonstrate the automatic OS update capabilities and how you can switch to a completely different ostree-based operating system.
