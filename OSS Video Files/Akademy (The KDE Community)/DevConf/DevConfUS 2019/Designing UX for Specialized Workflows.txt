Title: Designing UX for Specialized Workflows
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Máirín Duffy

Have you ever been stuck wondering how to construct a user experience for a highly specialized workflow that you're not even familiar with yourself? What if the application is so novel, no clear UX model exists and you're starting with a completely blank slate?

Red Hat UX designer Máirín Duffy will walk you through a case study of how to handle this using screenshots / demos, design artifacts, and decision points from the design of the new user interface for ChRIS, the open source, cloud-based medical image analysis platform created with Boston Children's Hospital. 

Watch this talk to learn:

- Research techniques for working in an unfamiliar context
- What UX models are and why they matter
- How to develop a UX model
- What interface affordances are and how they reinforce your UX model

	00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,500
now this is the first time I've given

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,340
this presentation so it might be a

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,379
little crunchy on the edges and you know

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,230
the topic designing UX for specialized

00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:16,690
workflows the point really is how do you

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,000
design UX for something that you do not

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,750
understand and really nobody could

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,070
expect you to understand right the other

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,810
thing is that I kind of have a bit of a

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,480
framework that I outlined in here it's

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,760
been my personal approach to working

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,129
with projects like this there's no book

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:37,030
or anything so I might be like using

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:38,589
terms that don't exist sorry I will also

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,949
make these slides available I'll post

00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:45,100
them to the sketch org because they are

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:47,289
chock full sorry so I'm gonna kind of

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,359
like skim over the top of them so if you

00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:53,829
miss anything don't worry that they will

00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,940
be posted okay so so why do I have

00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,859
anything useful to say on this topic

00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,329
right like you might want to know that

00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,460
before you actually pay attention to

00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,979
what I have to say I've been working at

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,860
Red Hat my entire career since basically

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:08,200
I graduated from school and in that in

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,939
that time period I've worked on a lot of

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,219
projects that have very specialized

00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,560
workflows like you know I worked on the

00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:16,840
Red Hat satellite product that is a

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,909
system that people can use to manage ten

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,299
thousand systems that's quite quite a

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:24,520
scale right but I'm not assisted man so

00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,829
how would I design for that or you know

00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,869
like virt-manager is another thing I

00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,850
actually worked on that a really long

00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,180
time ago when FERC was just becoming a

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,479
thing I think the first version uses n

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,920
instead of KBM and I didn't really know

00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,070
anything about virtual machines at the

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,700
time anaconda the Linux installer for

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,009
Braille Fedora uses a lot of enterprise

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,109
storage technology that's pretty complex

00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,000
that the average bear is maybe not ever

00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:53,770
heard of so how do you design for that

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,450
when you have no clue or the Cris

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,880
project which is a project I work on

00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,200
right now with it's a partnership that

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,170
we have with Boston University and

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Children's Hospital in Boston

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,600
it's a medical imaging platform it's for

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,550
neuroscientists I'm not a neuroscientist

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,110
so how would I design for things like

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,530
that well we'll talk about sort of my

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,140
secrets of how you do this okay so what

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,760
do I mean by specialized workflow these

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,410
are just maybe four properties that

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,750
might help define it they're very

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,540
precise I'm assuming neuroscience is

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,280
pretty precise at scale so like for

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,870
satellite you know you may be able to

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,760
manage your own system you have your own

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,670
personal laptop but are you managing

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,590
tens of thousands of systems at all

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,100
different locations that's definitely at

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,860
scale it's complex so it's not something

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,660
that can be done casually and by unusual

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,760
I don't mean like strange or weird I

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,030
just mean it's not typical right so the

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,170
we were just a really hammer the point

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,720
cooking dinner is not a specialized

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,170
workflow right driving a car

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,000
first aid those are not but you could

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,150
take each of them to a specialized level

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you know cooking steak sous vide at 135

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,680
yeah flying a commercial jet you know

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,079
maybe it's just like driving a car but

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,640
certainly it's not it's not it's unusual

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,140
it's not something that you know you

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,510
could expect a general population of

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,720
people to understand okay I like takes

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,340
on Twitter yeah so the other thing about

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,769
this is like if you're designing a user

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,260
experience you really need to understand

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,060
what the users workflow is if you don't

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,860
and you're just sort of mocking things

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,690
up to try to have something on the

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,430
screen you're a visual designer and

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,410
there is nothing wrong with that but if

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,010
you want to do UX design you really need

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,480
to dig into what flows and just to

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,650
hammer it and again I think I'll

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,680
probably delete this slide because I

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
think I made the point okay

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,599
[Music]

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,940
and this is just a basic outline of what

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,970
we're going to talk about you're going

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,130
to start with research right and this is

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,110
a special because you're working with

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,660
specialized workflows if you're talking

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,430
to specialists there's some user

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,920
research techniques that I've found are

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,290
just more effective whether they produce

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,000
the best results so just so you can do

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,970
them logistical II in this sort of space

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,459
so we'll talk about those we'll talk

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,769
about UX models what is a UX model what

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,320
do I mean by that and how how does that

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,570
help how to actually create a UX model

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,280
and then once you have your X model or

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,440
at least kind of a rough draft of it how

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,229
do you actually represent that in the UI

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,850
itself on the surface and by that I'm

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:30,520
going to sort of frame it by interface

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,710
affordances if you've read Don Norman's

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,660
the design of everyday things and it's

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,960
basically that although maybe I extended

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:46,210
a bit far from what he says f na graffia

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,250
is anybody heard of this term okay I

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,720
really don't like about UX design and

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,550
just a feel in general is they like to

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,650
come up with terms they like to change

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,390
them they like to kind of needle gaze at

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,140
them and make things complicated it's

00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,820
not complicated

00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,500
ethnography it comes from anthropology

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,870
it's just it's the study of people and

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,940
what they do okay so that's what you're

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,740
doing contextual inquiry another one of

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,479
those terms that kind of sounds it's

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,729
talking to somebody you're talking to

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,419
somebody for two hours and you're just

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:15,039
learning about what do they do a

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,340
contextual inquiry is something that is

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,630
best done in person you can do it

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,870
remotely I've done it remotely before

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,310
with screen sharing it gets tedious so I

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,990
wouldn't do it for two hours I might do

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,729
it for one hour but basically you come

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,810
kind of pre-loaded like oh okay I'm

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,970
gonna design the software for

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,100
neuroscientists I have this you know

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,800
really busy neuroscientist I got some

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,900
time with let me kind of preload try to

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,180
figure out what do I want to learn so

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,400
you know the Cris project is something

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,559
that neuroscientists used to analyze

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,139
brain image data

00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:48,519
so let me let me start thinking about

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,329
what do I want to know what this guy

00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,859
does okay how do you figure out what

00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:55,779
images you want to look at and what kind

00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:58,389
of analysis are you gonna do on them can

00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,819
you show me how you go about analyzing

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:03,129
an image and you can kind of cue up you

00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,589
know she'll show up prepared but then

00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,389
once you follow how they're doing the

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,369
task you're basically it's it's like a

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,449
work-study thing right like they're

00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,089
teaching you you're like they're

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,249
apprentice so it's really all it is and

00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:18,219
just take notes figure out and you get

00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:20,589
an idea job shadowing is sort of the

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:23,139
same thing but you do it for maybe a

00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,659
longer period of time like maybe a full

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,789
day and just just tag along be their

00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:29,499
shadow pretend you're like a first date

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,779
intern tell them to treat you that way

00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:32,979
and just get a feel for like the

00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,049
environments that they're moving through

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,669
you know maybe they're just sitting at a

00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:38,169
desk and taking a lunch break and a

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,549
snack break every now and then maybe

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,319
they're out in the field they're walking

00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:43,479
around the hospital what kind of devices

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,279
are they using who are they interfacing

00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,559
with what different departments take

00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,479
notes of all that stuff and then an

00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:51,459
interview interviews you can't do a job

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,939
shadow remotely an interview you can do

00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:56,589
remotely you can do it asynchronously

00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,959
that's a good fallback if you have a

00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,639
tough time getting accessed and you know

00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,559
these sort of tasks sometimes it can be

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,779
really difficult because these are a

00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:06,339
certain type of specialty that it's just

00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:09,489
hard to get access to the user so you

00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:11,559
can't follow sort of the commandments of

00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:13,509
user research like it's not easy to get

00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:15,069
the sort of access you need to perform

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,049
your research so you just have to kind

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:19,569
of wing it and do what works so

00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:20,919
interviewing can work you can just send

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,629
it through email and have them answer

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,849
questions in the email you can do it

00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:26,799
over the phone you don't need to be

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,319
present but being present always helps

00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:31,659
because you can see the work environment

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,419
okay this is just a sample like

00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,119
interview prompts that I wrote up for

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,529
the Chris project

00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:40,360
okay mentorship is one that I rely on

00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,460
most heavily for Chris and that's

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,499
basically buddy up or someone who is a

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,139
specialist in the field and just use

00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:48,879
them like you don't use them but ask

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,949
them lots of questions like on an

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,259
ongoing continual basis so it's not like

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,389
a one-shot research deal it's you have

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,309
an existing ongoing relationship with

00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,379
them you can have them sanity check

00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:01,809
ideas you can have some questions that

00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,909
sort of thing this works really well for

00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:05,619
the chris project it's it's kind of hard

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,059
to get access to neuroscientists for

00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,029
sort of the more rigorous stuff so this

00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:11,800
is very helpful and in basic training

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,389
this is sort of running up on your own

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,039
basically and you might want to even

00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,869
start with this just so because every

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,479
every special feel has its own jargon

00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:20,979
right like one that comes up in sis

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,149
admitting a lot that I see people

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,069
getting confused about it's pixie

00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:26,619
booting right like I see people spell it

00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,599
pixie like a little fairy there's just

00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:30,430
like a few terms just growing up on what

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,319
what the basic terms are they're used in

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,089
the field just so you you're not wasting

00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:36,279
time the precious time that you have

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,800
with your research subjects like asking

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,360
about basic terms there's a bunch of

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,430
ideas here when I worked on RedHat

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,339
satellite which is a submitting tool I

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,389
got an Rh CT certification they'll sort

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,470
of part of the process and want to

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,779
understand well what are the users

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,529
trying to do you could do short online

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:55,779
courses they tend to be cheaper free TED

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,870
Talks or actually if you find someone oh

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,430
sorry TED Talks if you find someone

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,959
who's a specialist in the field has

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,300
given a TED talk that can be a great

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,560
introductory it's like bite-size they're

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,029
usually like with five minutes or

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,209
something like that and they're at a

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,529
high level but you can understand and

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,060
like entry-level textbooks at the

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,250
library if you find syllabus is online

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,329
you can figure out what is the basic

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,209
textbook in this field

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:20,829
maybe I'll skim through it this is a

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,649
class that I'm taking actually right now

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,899
on Coursera on medical image well and

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,060
they do other image processing too but

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,620
they talk about medical image processing

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,440
which has been helpful for me and

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,019
designing for Chris

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,579
okay obsession lips ooh you can see I'm

00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,250
pretty pregnant right now I've had quite

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:39,600
a few visits to ultrasound and

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,190
ultrasound Tech's are you know medical

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
imaging specialist so I've picked their

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:47,639
brain quite a bit and maybe annoyed them

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,519
but and there's different ways you know

00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,689
you can engage with the field and kind

00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,600
of you know like one thing that I

00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:56,399
recommend is if you can find people in

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,100
the field who are sort of notable I

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,629
follow them on social media you get

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,730
little bite-size snippets of information

00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:04,649
about the field on an ongoing basis

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,990
sometimes that can be more helpful than

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,990
like a huge brain dump in like one

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,180
session so yeah I mean just try to

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,589
obsess about it as much as you can have

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,620
a genuine interest because your design

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,209
will be better for it I'm just gonna

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,970
skip this because it's not super

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,980
relevant yeah so basically talk to

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,319
people and read anything you can on the

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,879
subject it's simple but maybe sometimes

00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,019
it seems really hard especially when you

00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,779
have a hard time getting access to

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,639
people I mean even if you have like you

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,480
know for example using the Cris example

00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,220
maybe you have a cousin who they're not

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,259
a radiologist but they work in a

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,540
hospital and they know radiologists pick

00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,860
their brain get their take on it you

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,189
know anything you can do to get as close

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,800
to the subject as possible okay so now

00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:51,540
this is maybe sort of the magical part I

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,459
don't know you've learned all this

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,750
information about the specialty what are

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,180
you going to do with it how does that

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,540
translate into a usable interface for

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,670
people in that specialty so your ex

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,290
model is sort of maybe a term I made up

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,639
because if you google it what you get

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,509
back is nothing like what I'm talking

00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,370
about

00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,079
it's just a way like when you're

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,300
building software software is not a

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,949
physical world thing so it involves

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,800
abstractions abstractions can be

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:18,899
complicated because it doesn't exist in

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,339
space because maybe the hierarchies of

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,130
how things relate to each other aren't

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,870
clear the UX model is how you define how

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,399
all of these things relate to each other

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,980
how the artifacts and the interface

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,110
relate to other artifacts what kinds of

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,759
tasks you can perform in them if there's

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,220
any hierarchy or relationships between

00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,520
them you define that stuff and then once

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,100
you have the UX my end okay

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm trying to add this new feature how

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,820
does it relate to the interface you have

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,440
a model like a working model that's

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,450
defined that you can figure out well

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,830
based on the model that I created things

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,480
should probably work this way

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:56,600
and we'll go into more detail here

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,860
does anybody here use Twitter okay I

00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,300
know the cool kids aren't using it

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,740
anymore and I'm like older I guess so

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:10,130
yeah maybe I'm too old SMS texting on

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:12,770
your phone yeah okay and IRC these are

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,520
apps that's really what they are they're

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,410
all the same

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,420
they involve people chatting with each

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,700
other but because they're models that UX

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,800
models are so different they feel so

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,630
different people interact and behave on

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,550
them differently because the your ex

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,779
model drives their behavior so with

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,029
Twitter it's like a global public

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,060
broadcasts like I can go on Twitter and

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:34,790
you know I can address Beyonce I mean I

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,440
could it's not like she's gonna like it

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,390
or follow it or read it but you can it's

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,610
like a global system so when you're

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,440
talking on Twitter by default it's like

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,959
a performance so people are sort of in a

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,279
performative mode so it kind of puts you

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,180
in a certain space and you say things

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:53,720
that you know you kind of act out a bit

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,829
right with SMS by default I'm gonna say

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,050
for all these when I'm making these

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:58,970
points it's the default by default it's

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,920
point to point so you're talking to one

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,200
person it's assumed to be a private

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,050
conversation I don't know about the NSA

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,310
but and it's it's not performative it's

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,410
in chronological order

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,089
Twitter sort of mucks with your timeline

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,610
so you might be seeing tweets that

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,790
people made last week based on different

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,260
you know algorithms but with SMS you're

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,520
receiving every message and you're

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,149
receiving them in chronological order

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,370
with IRC you can do point-to-point but

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,390
by default is based on rooms which are

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,250
just you know you might have a hundred

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,680
two hundred people in a room when you

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,930
talk on IRC by default you're addressing

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,550
a crowd

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,870
you're not addressing globally you're

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,360
not addressing every single user in the

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,520
system and those properties of these UX

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,080
models for these apps change people's

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,310
behavior it changes their perception of

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,220
how the platform works okay so these are

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,600
just some things I made up that make

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,730
sense to me that I hope make sense to

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,200
you the first thing that I start with

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,089
with a UX model is coming up with a

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,520
concept map which is just a mind map

00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:59,080
it'll involve artifacts and I say

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,670
artifacts because I'm trying to avoid

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,290
the word object because like you have

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,630
object-oriented program and then people

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,670
think oh it's like programming objects

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,740
it's not know by artifact it sounds

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,380
fancy it's not I just mean like for

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,050
example in Chris we have you have data

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,790
that comes in you have what we call

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,270
feeds and I'll talk about that a little

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,520
bit

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,110
you have plugins and plugins operate on

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,089
the feeds so stuff like that like your

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,920
basic terminology and like the things

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,940
you're actually working within the

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,570
interface that's what I mean by

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,490
artifacts you kind of map them do like a

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,930
bit of a mind mapping to figure out well

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,339
how do these things relate what actions

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,650
can you perform and which ones that kind

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,810
of thing I'll show you an example and

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,700
then artifact models so for each

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:44,500
artifact like what are the properties of

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:47,360
it for example in Chris when you're

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,629
importing data into Chris

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,069
what is the lifetime of that object are

00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:53,269
you kind of pulling it in and then

00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,350
you're working with it real quick and

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,029
then you can delete it you're not going

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,350
to need it anymore or is it something

00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,299
that you're gonna need to reference over

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,860
a long period of time what are the

00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,110
properties of it how big is it what

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,939
image format isn't it that kind of stuff

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,129
you have to think about those things and

00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:09,199
in the collaboration model are there

00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,509
multi users on this system is it

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,079
I just log in as a single user I have my

00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,670
own files that's it how does the system

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,839
like how am i interacting with it am i

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:23,679
logging into a website is it client-side

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,679
application that sort of stuff

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,299
ordering defaults I mean that sort of

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,939
comes from how you're defining the

00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:33,589
artifacts model so like if it's

00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:35,480
something that's time-based like a

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,040
newspaper website is not going to give

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,860
you news from two months ago because

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,959
it's very important that stories the

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,119
most latest ones are at the front but

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,129
for other things maybe something that is

00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:47,839
the most frequently used it would be

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:50,410
best to be put up front so you have to

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,699
think about how things be ordered

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,499
workflow and integrations so this is an

00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:56,480
interesting one you have to think

00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:58,970
outside of your application with Chris

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,189
you have to think about at some point an

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,379
MRI machine was involved in this entire

00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:06,290
workflow how do I get the things from

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,850
the MRI machine into this platform you

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,889
know there's something called a PAC

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,970
server a lot of medical institutions and

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,649
that's sort of like a central server

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,209
where all the medical images go after

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,549
they're coming off the devices that read

00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:20,540
them and we have to interface with that

00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:23,929
and we have to in such a way that users

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,730
our users are accustomed to working with

00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:26,899
PAC servers to retrieve data so we have

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,579
to make sure that we're following the

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,199
same patterns and the same methods that

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:34,100
other tools they use to interface with

00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,019
PACs might you might do the Access

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,639
footprint like are you are you sitting

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:38,929
in an office in a laptop do you have a

00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,239
mobile device do you have a more

00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:42,769
specialized device those kinds of things

00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,899
these should all be built into the model

00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,919
because they make decisions like you

00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,720
know I used Twitter as an example

00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,089
earlier when Twitter was originally

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,279
built it had that 140 character if limit

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,570
which is oh so wonderful whatever people

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,800
talk about that being so

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,960
the reason they had that was because

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,260
they built it primarily as an SMS system

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,300
and SMS has a character limit so that's

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,620
why they started with the 140 characters

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,260
now they are on like different

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,569
narratives came around where we wanted

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,240
people to do to keep things precise and

00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,309
speak very concisely but it was a

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,260
technical limitation that drove that so

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:20,640
and you have to be aware of those things

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,740
when you're designing something that's

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,220
kind of important actually I could rant

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,900
about this for hours

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,330
logging into this thing right a lot of

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,340
social media in particular uses what is

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,440
called dark UX patterns to get people

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,120
kind of addicted to get them coming back

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,190
dopamine hits all that stuff you've

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,990
probably heard this before from someone

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,300
you have specialized workflows that

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,410
you're designing for and people are

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,470
coming to it because they're trying to

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:53,040
do their job so basically just make sure

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,470
that the tool does it fits that workflow

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,880
it performs what they need and they'll

00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,900
come back to it to get their job done so

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,580
you don't really need to worry about

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:05,309
employing any of those weird tricks or

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:07,890
whatever psychological warfare we just

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,780
talked about UX mottos come from user

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,179
research you shouldn't be making them

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,679
about us in err any kind of decision

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,300
that you make and how things are

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,070
constructed in your model should

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,840
directly relate to something you learned

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,050
in your research talking directly to the

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,420
specialists an important one that I

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,559
think relates to something that the last

00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:31,559
talk talked about with optimistic UI

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:34,020
when when you do like an optimistic UI

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,610
where maybe the message hasn't been sent

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,580
to the server and successfully submitted

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,170
but you show it client-side as if it had

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,210
you're not representing exactly what

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,820
happened in the backend that's okay the

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,660
UX model does not have to be the same as

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,730
the MVC model of the application it does

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,260
not have to be exactly the same is how

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,360
things are modeled in the backend it's

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,620
usually a

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,630
very good thing that they're not the

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,110
same so you have to be careful when

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,620
you're talking about it okay how am i

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,620
doing for time

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:11,000
okay so creating a UX model I start with

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,460
a mind map just like kind of what I

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,920
talked about before and then like maybe

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,570
a competitive UX model analysis and I

00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,400
wrote sort of there so like for the

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,360
Chris project which is a medical imaging

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,309
platform we looked at tools like blender

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,580
there which is a 3d editing suite I

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:31,250
looked at Dobby Lightroom and the open

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,040
source equivalent darkroom or doc table

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,530
and again like these are not medical

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,850
tools but they do something they have

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,610
something to do with image processing

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,710
and I wanted to see well what patterns

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,280
kind of are in common that we could sort

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,380
of glom on to to make this experience

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,910
make sense and then once you do your

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,190
competitive analysis and map out your

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,320
concepts you figure out well how am I

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,419
gonna adapt these to my application like

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,700
you're not gonna copy exactly how

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,559
something else works but what are the

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,210
things you can learn from them and take

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,400
into it to make your interface more

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,610
intuitive so I'll give examples cuz I

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,070
think they'll help ya just along the way

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,870
review your research sanity check with

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,350
any mentors you might have engaged with

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,730
and this is sort of the struggle if

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,710
you're working with a pre-existing code

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,929
base check your model against the

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,250
implementation it's really nice and

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,350
there's ponies and unicorns flying

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,610
around when you can actually implement

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,470
your UX model as it was originally

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,030
designed but you're probably gonna have

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,040
to make compromises based on how the

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,000
backend is implemented and then that's

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,340
just life but there's lots of

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,540
opportunity to actually change the

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,020
backend to be able to support your

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,200
design to

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,630
okay so this is an example content map

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,060
for kind of I call this a component of a

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,380
UX model this shows different components

00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,480
of Chris and you can see like where

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,270
boxes on inside other boxes it shows a

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,590
bit of a hierarchy the most important

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,820
piece is like some of these ones on the

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,320
right are out of date so don't even pay

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,470
attention to them but the most important

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,080
piece is you get data you put it into a

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,600
feed once the data has been pushed into

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,270
a feed you can chain together plugins

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,160
and pipelines and pipelines are

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,050
basically compositions or plugins and

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,390
these manipulate the data and you get

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:17,490
output out of it that's sort of the base

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,600
model of the Chris project okay and then

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,310
I'm just going to talk about the

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,540
competitive I mentioned with the DEP

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:24,750
blender in Lightroom I'm just going to

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,030
talk about those okay so blender has

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,830
something I think it's nearly 2.5 series

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,260
it's like the node editor is anybody

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,810
here familiar with blender at all okay

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,540
cool so basically each one of these

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:40,050
boxes corresponds to plugins and Chris

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,420
right and every box it sort of it takes

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,470
an action it has config variables you

00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,540
can chain them together in a different

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,630
order the thing that we took from this

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,020
is you chain them together in a certain

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,880
order

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,670
you run the data through it it's called

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,890
a pipeline this term pipeline is very

00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,480
common in the image processing world so

00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,540
we adopted that term and we use the term

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,610
pipeline too and the other thing is that

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,080
it's a graph based interface blender is

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,060
not the only tool that does this sort of

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,070
image manipulation that has a graphical

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,660
interface I would say as a designer

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:15,080
there there is no really common graph

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,430
widget that exists so I was very

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,350
frightened to maybe represent the

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,240
literally as a graph in the interface I

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,950
fought against it a bit but after

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,690
surveying all the different tools and

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,550
seeing you know they use a graph based

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,320
interface like max/msp for audio

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,810
manipulation it's not even images it

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,360
uses that so I'm like okay we'll use

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,070
graphs so this is how it ended up and

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,100
we're doing a top-down graph rather than

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,510
left to right just because

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,640
in a web-browser and I thought we'll top

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,040
down you have a lot more space and it

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,470
just made sense and then they can fit

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,050
where you can figgy is on the right-hand

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:51,500
panel but that's how we kind of took it

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,360
and adapted it to fit our model and this

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,640
is just some tricks I tried with like

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,410
cards to try to like fake a graph but it

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,710
didn't work so we did an actual graph

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,970
okay and then with Lightroom and

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,210
darktable they're both tools that

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,610
process raw images out of a camera and

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,230
the thing that we took from this is it

00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,540
sort of separates the process into

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,160
stages this shows this stage where you

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,220
sort of I'd call it hunting and

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,630
gathering for images to process we have

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,120
to do something similar with Chris right

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,470
because you have the PAC server or you

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,510
might have images you're uploading

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,700
directly or you might have images that

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,770
you're getting from an image set that

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,420
was created for certain types of studies

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,580
you basically have to hunt and gather

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,950
what images are am I actually going to

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,540
run analysis on and that's sort of a

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,900
different stage is different tools you

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,490
need at that stage darktable calls a

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,620
light table

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,840
I believe Lightroom calls it a library

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,000
so we sort of adapted that term and we

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,560
call it the library and we split it out

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,880
into stages this doesn't this is

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,280
actually a mock-up it doesn't exist yet

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,870
but it's in the planning stages but this

00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,800
is sort of what you can gather what is

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,320
the data much you're going to be

00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,630
inputting into the process and it's got

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,010
all different sorts of layout to make it

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,610
clear here's all the different ways you

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:07,790
defined images all right so just a quick

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,380
review on how to create a UX model you

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,640
just sort of mindmap the concepts that

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,250
you're working with the tasks that

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,260
you're working with look around and see

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,820
what other tools sort of they either

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,770
work with objects that have similar

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,810
relationships with each other or they do

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,280
sort of a similar they're working a

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,930
similar space and just see what you can

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,000
learn from them because again like

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,430
something is going to be easier for the

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,290
user to use if it's not novel like if

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,510
they recognize what they're supposed to

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,550
do they recognize oh okay I see this

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,050
type of object typically if it's called

00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,940
a pipeline it's things being chained

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,230
together okay if you want them to have

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,110
that recognition so there's less

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,340
explaining necessary

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,420
and then adapt what you find to your

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,890
software's needs okay now how much time

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,890
do we have

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,330
[Music]

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,840
Wow those six okay I'm gonna move really

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,690
fast

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,520
okay this is the last section so we kind

00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,620
of talk through sort of the high-level

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,870
abstract what am I actually even

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,470
designing for what am i users doing what

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,510
do they need to even what is this domain

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,130
space that they're working in we pushed

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,200
that into building out a UX model to

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:13,150
support that once you have your model

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,860
how do you actually enforce that on the

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,660
screen so this is surface level details

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:20,919
like interface of Florence's is what I'm

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:23,530
calling it so these are called dawn

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,000
morning doors there's quite a few of

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,320
them that Red Hat's office in Boston I

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,840
don't know about this building I haven't

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,990
exploited too much if you look at the

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,760
door you can't even tell it's a door and

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,470
then like somebody has to make signs to

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,470
tell you oh yeah you push on this and it

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,910
opens the door inherently doesn't have

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,260
properties that give you a hint as to

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,150
what you're supposed to actually do with

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,799
it so you don't want to go down Norman

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,620
doors in your interface you want to

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,690
enforce your model by having any objects

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,190
in the interface have properties that

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,549
make it clear what is meant to be done

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,549
with them

00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:02,410
is anybody seen Star Trek for maybe no

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,630
okay so Scotty is from the future and

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,010
he's in the 1980s in San Francisco and

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,360
he's trying to interact with a computer

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,549
and he thinks the mouse is a microphone

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,320
you want to avoid situations like that

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,419
right like you want someone to know

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,250
right away okay I pick this up and I

00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:20,860
move it with my hands yes so affordances

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,360
are just basically their property the

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,620
properties of objects in your system

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,950
make it obvious what they're meant to be

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,230
done what's meant to be done with them

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,760
you can enforce your UX model through

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,230
affordances now a lot of times when

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,020
people talk about interface affordances

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,910
they talk about basic stuff like radio

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,070
buttons you can pick one checkboxes you

00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,650
can pick multiple stuff like that but

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,450
you can you can enforce it your ex model

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:47,180
levels and than just like widget

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,070
selection visual models and terminology

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,110
like I talked about how we adopted the

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,660
term pipeline and Chris I talked about

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:56,210
how we adopted graphs as a layout method

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,830
for pipelines and Chris that's how

00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,540
you're enforcing your model you're

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,340
creating an affordance because you're

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,680
using a standard pattern that people use

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,740
for that type of thing so people see the

00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,450
graph people hear the term pipeline and

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,700
they immediately sort of get more into a

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,530
space of understanding what is meant by

00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,530
these things what am I supposed to do

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:18,320
with them motion are changed to

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:21,170
represent actions that can help so

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,050
liking Chris if you submit a plug-in it

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,850
in acts right away so to enforce that we

00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,140
change the status right away so you see

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,940
movement on the screen you see that

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,190
something's changed you know it's

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,450
working

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,200
following widely-used patterns and

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,520
standards is obviously good affordance

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,660
[Music]

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,280
buttons want to be clicked so think

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,290
about actions when you're presenting

00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,550
actions to the user make sure that the

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,710
actions that have the best real estate

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,360
are the actions that make the most sense

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,220
for them to be doing with that object I

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,840
know it sounds obvious but it's not

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,179
always and practice something that

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,290
interfaces do and don't forget about

00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:59,030
scale so you know might make sense and

00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,059
testing to do a drop-down for plug-in

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:05,030
selection but if you think about as a

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:06,950
platform Chris wants to enable all sorts

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:10,130
of different plugins and pipelines to be

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,080
used for image processing I think I

00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:14,330
personally think drop-down selection

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,020
boxes maxed out at about seven items and

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:19,370
that's optimistic so if it's gonna be

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,440
like hundreds or thousands of options

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,600
there you have to build a system around

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,880
actually enabling the user to navigate

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,470
that scale and that sets up an

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,100
affordance where the user understands

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,100
okay cool

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,260
yeah so basically affordances let you

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,570
know what you're meant to do in the

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:41,090
system it helps enforce your UX model

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,130
because it gives users hints that what

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,250
each object is meant to do what you can

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,050
do with it

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,840
visuals terminology motion patterns

00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,670
placement of actions appropriate scaling

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,530
or all different types of affordances

00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,470
that you can put in your user interface

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,340
on the surface to enforce the UX model

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:04,340
that's driving it underneath okay just a

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,230
quick review you don't need to be a

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,350
rocket scientist to design for one you

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,850
just need to talk to one if you

00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:14,030
understand your users specialized

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,130
workflows then you can build a UX model

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:20,240
based on your research once you have the

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:22,370
UX model you can enforce it on the

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,240
surface of the UI using interface

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:28,360
affordances yes and I think that's

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,770
enough review okay

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,670
so anybody have any questions I'm just

00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,670
glad I didn't run over

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,370
[Music]

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,319
alright that works

00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:45,319
[Music]

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,080
sure yeah that's a really good question

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,510
see I'm gonna give you the answer I'm

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,850
gonna sound very lazy but narrative is

00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,410
really the best way if you start I mean

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,060
the thing is like I have so many things

00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,700
in my head about how like Chris's UX

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,230
model works and there isn't really like

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,460
a standard way to document it I wish

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,420
there was I could probably write a book

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,090
and make money that way

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,700
but honestly it's just how you end up

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,470
talking about the thing it's the stories

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,150
that you tell about how the thing works

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,220
its how when you're talking to

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,570
developers you just naturally start

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,980
talking about things in search of such a

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,480
way and like when I first started

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,550
working on Chris we didn't even have all

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,840
the terminology ironed out so sometimes

00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,770
you would be talking to a developer

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,270
about something and you'd be talking

00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,250
about the same thing and using

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,070
completely different language so even

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,320
just establishing those terminologies I

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,670
actually do have like a cheat sheet doc

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,860
that I wrote up that has all the

00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,980
different terms you know so that can be

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,720
a way having the concept model document

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,280
I mean I shared it with people it's not

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,170
like they're referring to it constantly

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,210
right so that's that's where you kind of

00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,800
don't get into the rigor of keeping

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,750
updated documentation I think the

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,900
narrative is really the best way to do

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,900
it

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,030
so

00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,030
where

00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,360
what can you have you can't do anything

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:22,270
I'm so angry okay so a contextual

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,770
inquiry is really driven more by the

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,900
user completing the task and your

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,640
observation of the task whereas an

00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,710
interview is really more driven by the

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,600
questioner and you can go off-script

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,810
with an interview I honestly recommend

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,070
that you do but sometimes especially if

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,110
it's asynchronous and you're doing it

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,030
over email you don't have the high

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,160
bandwidth back-and-forth where you can

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,200
quickly switch gears with your

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,180
questioning so that's that's sort of the

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,620
main difference is who's driving the

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,170
content is it the person being

00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,040
interviewed the specialist or is it the

00:31:50,170 --> 00:32:05,240
user research are asking the questions

00:31:52,040 --> 00:32:05,240
[Music]

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,460
they fail so well

00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:22,180
I mean the narrative doesn't a narrative

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,530
doesn't have to be oh I am the master of

00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,480
all and I have the narrative and you

00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,880
must speak to me to learn it I mean it's

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,830
just it's it's sort of like a cultural

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,020
thing like it pervades the entire team

00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,730
so if you're really persistent about

00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,920
anytime someone talks about this

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,230
particular type of artifact in the

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,450
interface I will call it a pipeline I

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,760
will be a jerk about it I will really

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,830
push the point it gets to the point that

00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,020
people just start sort of like using

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,030
that term and it propagates in the same

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,710
way like a narrative can propagate if

00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,230
you're very consistent and persistent

00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,020
about it another way you traditionally

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,720
just I as a person designing in the

00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,570
world propagate narratives this sounds

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,370
very evil and propagate narratives but I

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,740
like to document my design process

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,000
through blog posts developers find that

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,680
helpful too because then they can go

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,260
back and refer without plugging me

00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,240
personally or just get a refresher and

00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,610
that's it's a good way to sort of share

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,950
that narrative of what is this software

00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:19,510
actually meant to do right so I mean

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,160
there's there's so many ways to tell

00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,190
stories and then just make it becomes

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:27,130
more of a collaborative group owned

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,840
thing sorry it becomes more of a

00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,640
collaborative group owned thing and

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,640
maintain thing than just living in the

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,740
head of somebody I've interacted with

00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,860
designers in the past before not to go

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,410
into a huge rant but where it was all in

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,020
their head I'm sure it made sense but to

00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,180
get it out man I don't know it's hard

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,340
it's hard to work with that right

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,200
because you don't know so it's it's

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,900
really I think it's an important job of

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,290
the designer creating the UX model to

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:58,090
publicize it to market it to share it to

00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,760
retell the story over and over and

00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,890
sometimes when you tell this story to if

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,350
there's holes in the plot it'll come out

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,620
and then you can go back and adjust so I

00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:10,700
don't know I hope that helps

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,719
[Music]

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,310
will you ever be the model

00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,040
[Music]

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,800
oh absolutely you have to yeah and that

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,720
was like part of the Chris model was

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,490
hours and hours of discussion and sort

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,830
of well what if this well what if that

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:30,220
does this relate to this or that how do

00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,990
you do it you have to it's really I mean

00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,570
you want to get develop those involved

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:37,660
to um maybe I'll be a bit of a jerk and

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,610
just say you don't the users opinion

00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,490
like the end users the specialists they

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,710
are the ones who kind of get the veto on

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,240
anything a developer might come in and

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,920
complain well the back end can't do that

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,050
blah blah blah that's okay the back end

00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,060
can't do that now but in the future

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,520
maybe it should be able to if the users

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:58,410
are saying that's what they need so but

00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,410
yeah definitely definitely operation

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,609
[Music]

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:21,259
right sure yeah maybe that's an

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,650
assumption I should define upfront

00:35:21,259 --> 00:35:27,160
definitely like you can't just sort of

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,239
like dig in and like stick to something

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,039
especially when you're sharing and

00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:32,239
collaborating with others here reviewing

00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,680
the research and it shows well maybe

00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,999
this isn't the way to go like you have

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,099
to be able to adapt you have to be able

00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,869
to revise and I mean especially if it's

00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,369
a large project you have to do it

00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:42,109
iteratively you can't design the world

00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:44,569
it will go and then start implementing

00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:47,140
it you have to sort of build it out in

00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:47,140
iterations

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,500
I would say early on in the process

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,230
especially with the the Chris project a

00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,370
lot of diagrams a lot of like talking

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,920
through think well and this is the other

00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,270
thing that's kind of interesting you're

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,010
talking through things you're working

00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,110
through a lot of concepts like we would

00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:11,210
do a lot of our communication is through

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,460
chat and so it's handy because you have

00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,930
a text log but it's like so meandering

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,580
so one of the things that I started

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,980
doing is just writing summaries of

00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,690
conversations like oh yeah yesterday we

00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,870
had this big long discussion about you

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,970
know how users will share pipelines just

00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:29,120
writing up a summary of that and having

00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,770
it available and then once everybody

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,120
agrees on your summary because sometimes

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,470
people walk away from a conversation and

00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,960
they have totally different ideas on how

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,580
it went so have a summary that everybody

00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,650
agrees with yep that's how things went

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,060
that's what we decided it's not really

00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,130
like a contract but at least you know

00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,230
that you understood what happened and

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,360
then start maybe doing diagrams to show

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,430
it you know and then sort of vet those

00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,110
with everybody involved like does this

00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,240
diagram accurately represent what we

00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,890
talked about because when you start out

00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,110
when you're making a UX model you're not

00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,790
really you're not working up the surface

00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,870
level of the interface yet you're

00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,400
working with even how do all these

00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,620
concepts relate to each other what does

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,720
the user doing with them once you get

00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,420
beyond the UX model initial creation

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,900
stage you can move out of diagram space

00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,610
and into actual wire framework which is

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,650
basically the process we followed

00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,870
sometimes if you're doing a new feature

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,940
or you're revising something you might

00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,160
step back into diagram space you might

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,230
step back into research space it's

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,050
completely fluid there's no like the

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,110
main order is researched model mock-up

00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,490
but there's definitely fluidity between

00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:39,459
them

00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:39,459
[Music]

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,510
any other questions

00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,510
[Music]

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,780
anybody want to tell me what I sucked at

00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,400
here because it's the first time I've

00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,170
given this so what would you revise

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,760
about my talk I definitely had too much

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:56,330
material and I try to let go through it

00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:00,130
too fast is there anything you wish I

00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,130
talked about or you wish I didn't say

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,579
[Music]

00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:10,970
yeah so here's the thing so um I I have

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,170
a ThinkPad yoga which has an HDMI thing

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,520
that I was assuming I wouldn't be able

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,080
to hook up which I didn't realize till I

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,060
got here today I didn't think about it I

00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,340
was gonna go through like my git folder

00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,380
of all the design work and I can't do

00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,400
that cause it's not my laptop I could

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:27,050
show you sort of like you know I work in

00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,570
open-source I always work with

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,670
open-source projects so I try not to

00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,710
dictate tools because if you're working

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,300
with a public upstream like you know oh

00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,680
here's the designer from Red Hat going

00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,960
and dictating to us how we should do our

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,440
job No so I try to work where the team

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:47,450
works so like an example for Chris we

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,310
work in github so I kind of adapted my

00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,980
design process you know I share assets

00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,710
and resources through github hopefully

00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:02,170
this will load okay so we have for

00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:02,170
example this is the UI repo and then

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,589
okay

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,390
so right now like for the summer were

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:14,000
organized our project using a compound

00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:19,460
board that's in github I think it's this

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,930
one so you know like we have design

00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,579
tickets and we have developed Achatz so

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,380
the design ticket is the first one for

00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:28,339
the feature you come up with the designs

00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,800
and we actually use the ticket as the

00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:32,089
specification for the feature which I

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,640
don't know maybe that's not well maybe

00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:36,290
it's not so like you know there's a

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,880
little bit of discussion like what is

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,800
this what are we actually doing here

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,480
what is this design for what is some of

00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,950
the background on it and like you can

00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,480
see here like I wrote something and I

00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,609
decide it was crap so I stroke it out

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,190
but I left it there just for historical

00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:50,599
purposes and then you're just all the

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,359
different versions like this was the

00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,710
first cut of the mock-ups and then this

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,089
kind of drives like meetings or

00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,700
discussions about it like look at this

00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:01,160
what sucks what's good what are we gonna

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,829
do iterate on it so like as you get to

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:08,660
the bottom you'll probably see no

00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:12,440
there's no changes on this one changes I

00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:16,130
also have let's see there's a repo that

00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,839
the designers working we use it to a

00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,599
cloud sparkle share which is kind of

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,200
like Dropbox like front-end to get four

00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:28,400
designers and we have all our assets

00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:31,250
stored in a git repo and our the tool

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,930
that we use on most of the projects that

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,750
I work on is Inkscape for mock-ups so

00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,430
the files are SVG format the source

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,510
files but then we also have PNG output

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:43,530
of mock-ups yeah and so I can see I have

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,270
a UX model further

00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,240
and that has some stuff like we were

00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:52,770
talking about organizing assets in the

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,330
Kris UI using tags and so like you know

00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,680
as we were talking we're having the

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,290
discussion and I was like coming up with

00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,290
these different diagrams to show how the

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,600
tag model might work it's like for

00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,940
example like you have this says for a

00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,040
piece of data and it's I guess it's kind

00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:12,450
of hard to see with the projector the

00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:14,700
piece of data is labeled 1.1 2.1 so it

00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,020
has ancestors these are the pieces of

00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,310
data that came before it because every

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,530
time you take an image and you run a

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,870
plug-in on it then you get another it's

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:25,190
another piece of data is like the son of

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:27,990
the grandson of you know whatever so

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,210
data one 1.1 and 1.2 you are the

00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,770
ancestors of that and then you have data

00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,260
or one dot one dot two dot one dot one

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,240
is the descendant right and then these

00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,750
are the plugins that were involved in

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,400
producing that I mean okay basically I

00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,080
just visually laid out how we were

00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,000
discussing to kind of drive the

00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,470
conversation because this is how

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,440
something might work like in medical

00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,450
processing of images like so you have an

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,280
MRI image one of the first things you

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,590
might need to do is called registration

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,660
so you run a registration plug-in on the

00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,980
image and that sort of like aligns the

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,750
image like say someone in the MRI

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,430
machine like was itchy and they move

00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,710
their head so it like skews the

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,020
perspective that means it's harder to

00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,940
compare that image to other say brain

00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,070
images because the perspectives a little

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,680
wonky wonky so you run a registration

00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,270
process on the image and that sort of

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,860
like squishes the image so that it

00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,570
conforms to the standards then it could

00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,310
be compared to other images so that

00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:23,340
might be plug in one and then plug in to

00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:24,570
might be segmentation which is go

00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,800
through the image of the brain and you

00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,480
split it out into different brain

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,760
structures you kind of map out what are

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,380
the different spaces then once you have

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,750
it segmented you could run another

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,550
plugin that will calculate volume on a

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,590
specific segment and now that you have

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,620
it segmented you could actually say you

00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,420
know process the volume of segment three

00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,860
something like that so we were just kind

00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,570
of talking about how do these things

00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,070
relate to each other it's maybe way too

00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,290
in-depth on like a very specific

00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,450
conversation but you can see how like

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,930
that sort of drove some of the assets we

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,910
were producing as

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,650
the UX model we took that conversation

00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,320
and we built it into a series of

00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,000
diagrams showing how different image

00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,860
data was in the system could relate to

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,020
each other and trying to think about

00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:12,310
what tag model would support that think

00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:15,020
we have like one minute zero minutes all

00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:18,119
right so thanks for coming

00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,119
