	Speaker: Máirín Duffy

Have you ever been stuck wondering how to construct a user experience for a highly specialized workflow that you're not even familiar with yourself? What if the application is so novel, no clear UX model exists and you're starting with a completely blank slate?

Red Hat UX designer Máirín Duffy will walk you through a case study of how to handle this using screenshots / demos, design artifacts, and decision points from the design of the new user interface for ChRIS, the open source, cloud-based medical image analysis platform created with Boston Children's Hospital. 

Watch this talk to learn:

- Research techniques for working in an unfamiliar context
- What UX models are and why they matter
- How to develop a UX model
- What interface affordances are and how they reinforce your UX model
