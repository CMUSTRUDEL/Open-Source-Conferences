Title: Applied Open Design using modern HTML CSS
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: Jenn Giardino and Christie Molloy

A design system should guide your UI decisions, but not make decisions for you. PatternFly is an open source design system with an initiative to provide UI components that are modular; inspired by principles of BEM and atomic design. In this workshop, members of the PatternFly team will show you how to build complex UI patterns and customize styles using the PatternFly component library.

In this workshop, we'll demonstrate:
- How to use the HTML examples from the PatternFly component library to create new UI patterns
- How to use CSS variables to extend existing components or customize the visual theme 

Attendees interested in participating will need a laptop and a browser.

so good afternoon everyone and welcome

00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:07,170
to our session applied urban design to

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:08,550
blooded HTML and CSS CSS and hey i'm

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,440
jenn trade you know i'm the

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,440
accessibility lead for a pattern 5

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,980
[Music]

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:23,100
design HTML CSS javascript and

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,710
accessibility i'll session will focus on

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,050
how you can modify our site system for

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,560
your own projects by understanding how

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,720
how this and ins we use developers live

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,580
in permanent assembly house with this

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,750
knowledge we practice overriding and

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,480
expanding variables

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,250
switching over designs often this

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,500
presentation will be running over wash

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,610
up on pad ACOTA or your you'll be able

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,139
to apply

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,090
charge anyone that has about talking the

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:55,009
way is to follow along whether you want

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:57,470
or not so is very hot sauce design

00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:59,300
system creating consistency and

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,789
usability across a wide range of

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,729
applications in these phases we have two

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:06,350
teams with diamonds CSS bubbles reactive

00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:09,520
elements as well as open source

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,479
contributors all of them together

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,240
pattern player was created to

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,470
efficiently field straight like these

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,850
with right not having over fifty

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,740
different products it would be

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,650
impossible to create consistency post

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,600
every strange without design system any

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,729
developer across the board can take a

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,880
component to the layout to illustrates

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,310
what these in no time

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,320
so here I've burned down tip will how to

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:38,300
club you I strain into different

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:44,360
components but now a toolbar table

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:47,869
down and most people it was a compromise

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,039
layoffs and Emmas so here are some

00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:51,199
examples

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,909
components are reusable independent

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
structures that designs until that

00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:58,009
parent and three modules because that

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,110
modularity they can be used even how

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,759
employments we hands functionality and

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,949
they can be used with other compartments

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,550
breakdowns well three months of I lost

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,009
here's an example

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,589
grid layout and starkly out layouts of

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:14,419
the containers that are organizing

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:17,650
components a lot of a minister make

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,150
Marla the handles down necessary

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:28,270
[Applause]

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:31,570
[Music]

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,570
[Applause]

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,300
okay so one of the ways that we've been

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,760
able to make pattern fly as modular and

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,170
flexible as it is is by using the been

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,160
naming system M stands for block element

00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,470
modifier

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,540
it's a methodology that provides a

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,250
naming convention based on a concept

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,710
that a UI can be broken down into

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,720
individual blocks and that within those

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,580
blocks you would have elements that

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
create that book and that you could have

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,290
different variations of a block that you

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,000
might need to display so you can modify

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:21,540
that block to have different appearances

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,360
in scale or color or four-state so how

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,240
did fly does not follow them strictly it

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,160
borrows some aspects of them and I'll

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,350
show you here and the examples of the

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,940
class names that we have so if you look

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,860
at the class names on the Left these are

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,800
examples of class names that we use for

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,890
components and layouts so all of our

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,240
class names start with a PF this is so

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,700
that when you're looking at the classes

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,190
and your application it's easy for you

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,310
like you to identify which classes come

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,770
from pattern fly and then the component

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,810
class names start after the PF have a

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,900
dash C so that you can easily identify

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,930
which class names belong to components

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,840
I'm in the very first HTML element for a

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,060
component is the block so the block name

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,980
is usually the same as the component

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,150
name so in this case I have an example

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,070
of EF - C - alert for our alert

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,060
component that's the first class that

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,040
gets assigned to that component HTML

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,950
and then within that component we have

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,260
other elements so the way we name those

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,140
class seems is very similar to the block

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,620
classroom where we start with a PF and

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,330
we have a - C I only have the same name

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,550
that we used for the block so that you

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,100
know that this element belongs to that

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,470
component and then after the block name

00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,480
we have two underscores to separate the

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,610
block name from the element name and

00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,390
then we named that element so the

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,420
example I have here is PFC - alert

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,800
underscore underscore title for a title

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,460
that you would see within an alert

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,800
component our layout classes follow a

00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,080
very similar naming convention the only

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,810
difference is that we use an L to

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,990
identify those class names as layout

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,610
classes and then the examples on the

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,060
right is where we start to break away

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,030
from the been methodology the modifiers

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,580
if you are familiar with them the

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,830
modifier classes usually also identify

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,710
the block or block element that those

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,250
modifier classes are used for but when

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:27,320
we started off working on the HTML and

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,240
CSS for pattern fight we decided that

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,760
would add a lot of complexity to our

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,770
system so we decided to drop the block

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,800
an element from the class names and just

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,690
use the the modifier so all of our

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,700
modifier class names start with a PF

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,060
followed by a - M so that you know that

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,680
it's a modifier class and then the the

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,280
name of the modifier the thing that it

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,170
changes so in this case I have PF - in -

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,150
danger that we would use in Yeller

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,820
component to change how that alert

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,069
component displays but it can display as

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,540
a danger alert

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,910
when we define when we create our

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,839
components the modifiers that we create

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,550
for them are specific to HTML elements

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,019
in that component so you have to use

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,639
them as we document in our design system

00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,709
utilities on the other hand are classes

00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,449
that you can apply to any element in

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:21,360
your application these are more like

00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,920
helper classes so if the default styles

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,839
that we provide for our components in

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,680
pattern fly aren't exactly what you need

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,809
for your UI then you can apply a utility

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,629
class to slightly tweak how something

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:36,509
looks so in this example our pattern fly

00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:39,029
utility classes they they start with PFD

00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:40,980
you and then we name the property that

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:43,139
you're modifying and then we name the

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,899
value that your you're using when you

00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:51,269
use this utility class so the PF - you -

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:54,860
plg that's applying a large padding to

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,860
an element in your application

00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,130
so now I'm going to take you through an

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,720
example of a component and pattern

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,210
flight so you can see how these class

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,730
things are being used in HTML the

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,220
example on the Left shows two examples

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,560
of the alert component and then the HTML

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,470
on the right is the HTML for that

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,800
example on the left so you can see that

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,590
block class name is P f - C - alert it's

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,650
applied to the first HTML element for

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:27,720
that component and it's the entire tire

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:30,330
component the modifier class is also

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,160
defined on that parent element for this

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,170
component it will vary where the

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
modifier classes are used in components

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,880
in this example it just happens to also

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,730
be on me the first HTML element these

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,880
modifiers are changing what colors are

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:49,360
used for the icon the icon background

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,879
and then also the title color

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,649
and then you can see these alert

00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,179
examples are slightly different they

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,549
have different elements that make up

00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,610
that entire block so the first example

00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:03,160
has an icon and a title and then it has

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,559
an action on the far right and when the

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,689
second example also has an icon and a

00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,610
title but instead of an action it has a

00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:13,179
description and you can see how those

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:19,829
class names are defined and the HTML for

00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:22,540
those components as Christy mentioned

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,429
components can be nested inside of other

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,589
components so this is another component

00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,720
that we have in pattern Frye it's called

00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:31,239
the alert group so something to note

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,850
about this class name is that some of

00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:37,059
our block names are made up of more than

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,119
one word so we separate those words with

00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:44,170
a dash so the block in this case is

00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:47,259
alert group and that is the container

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,149
that wraps the elements within the alert

00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,369
group and the elements in the alert

00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:54,639
group are list items and renamed those

00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:57,549
alert group items and then you can see

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,100
in this example inside each list item

00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:02,619
that has the alert group item classroom

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,049
that's where we then nest the alert

00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:07,509
components so the alert group is

00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:09,669
basically just controlling the spacing

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,279
between the list items within the alert

00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:15,429
group and then the alert component is

00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,829
that block about individual alert that

00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:21,070
has the icon and the title and other

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:22,959
elements within that block

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,690
so now I'm gonna take you through an

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:31,149
example the component that uses pattern

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:34,690
for a variable so variables are how we

00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:38,649
define the values that are used in a CSS

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:40,810
rule set so in this example you can see

00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,630
the same classroom that I was showing in

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,060
a previous slice is for the alert title

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,880
and in this rule set we want to define

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,480
the value for font size we said that

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,420
that property to a component variable

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,180
the component variable name includes the

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,990
block and element that it's being used

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:06,180
for and then also the CSS property for

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:08,829
which it's providing a value and

00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,680
component variables are scoped to a

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:13,720
component and within that component on

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,779
that same component CSS file where you

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,120
saw the the rule set we map all of the

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,009
component variables to global variables

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,990
so in this example you see the same

00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:25,089
component variable that I showed on the

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,639
previous slide and now it's being mapped

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:30,279
to one of our global variables that we

00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,160
have defined the global variables are

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:35,649
how we provide consistency across our

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,170
design system and their names are

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:41,290
describing the property and then the

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,170
value that that variable provides so in

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:49,199
this case we're using the medium font

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:52,839
size for our alert title font size

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,509
and then this is illustrating how we

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,060
actually assign a value to our global

00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:01,120
variables so first we map a global

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,550
variable CSS properties to SAS variables

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,829
and then the SAS available is where we

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,139
actually give the value that we want to

00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:13,029
use one of the like key things with our

00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:14,889
global variables is that if someone

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:17,019
wanted to use pad and fly and didn't

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:19,000
want to use the default styles that we

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,649
had allocated to these global variables

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,470
it would be really easy for someone to

00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,149
just go through and change basic things

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,160
like if you wanted something that's a

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:29,350
little more compact you can go in and

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,850
and make those sizings a little bit

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,800
smaller if you want a different color

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:38,589
values you could go through and change

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,180
the colors that are used so now we're

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,970
gonna take you through one of our

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,439
training modules so you can see how you

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,290
can take an existing pattern fly

00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:49,980
component and extend it using pattern

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,980
fly variables

00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,240
sorry it's gonna take me some time Samir

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,130
the display so that I can follow along

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,399
with what Christy is taking you through

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,130
but if you want to follow us along

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,810
here's the URL to our main website

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,540
before the training modules yeah we'd

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,100
really encourage you to if you can so

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,769
it's katha kaadu comm forward slash

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,570
pattern five and Kevin Kota is an open

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,920
source training platform that we're

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,130
currently using to host a lot about

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,800
padam fly trainings and actually outside

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,000
of the booth where we have a station set

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,459
up where we're testing a lot of these

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,050
scenarios so if you enjoy the session a

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,200
little ride more definitely check that

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,200
out

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,800
could I get hands popping people that

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,910
are gonna fall along

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,910
[Music]

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,650
okay so you guys should see this stream

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,900
now and then when you get here you want

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,940
to click on the left box which is for

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,720
the HTML and CSS scenarios and just

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,720
click stop cost

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,180
I think it's a bit slow

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,760
okay so here you see you have five

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,929
different training modules and these are

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,299
all outside in the booth or you can

00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:24,709
access these whenever you want and today

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:28,720
we're gonna go over overriding and

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,559
extending variables so click on that

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,830
awesome and so now you should see this

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,309
page here when you get here click start

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,309
scenario

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,029
okay so the setup here is on the Left

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,370
panel there's content and then different

00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,049
pieces of code that you'll copy in the

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,010
right-hand corner is your editor where

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,289
you see the files that were going to be

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,750
editing and then the bottom panel here

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,260
is iframe which will render in the

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,700
background the card we're adding so so

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,740
the first step is to add code to the

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,269
workspace feel free to raise your hands

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,269
if you have any questions we wanna make

00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:15,529
this an open conversation so okay so

00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,970
before we get started we're gonna add

00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:19,370
some code to the workspace that we can

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:22,159
modify the step first step is to copy

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,779
code into your index dot HTML file and

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,230
you want to click the copy to editor

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:28,909
button below to add HTML to the index

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,330
file so you can see James just clicked

00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,190
our button and our codes up there

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,940
and then scroll down in your content

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,499
counter and so then for step two we're

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,950
gonna set up the new styles that were

00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:42,820
going to be overriding so there were two

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,980
books in this file

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,139
one is the route which targets Styles

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,960
across the entire application and then

00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:51,460
one is the PFC Cod block which targets

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,369
the Styles specific to the collared

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,409
component so quick again couldn't copy

00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,360
the editor button below to add code for

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:02,980
the collared component to the my app dot

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,869
CSS file and when the server erodes you

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,320
should see a card in your iframe do

00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:12,000
everyone see that

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,950
any trouble okay great so if we're step

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,130
two we're gonna override atom five

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,170
variables to achieve a new fame so now

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,790
that we have the card in that page we're

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,960
gonna customize the Styles applied to it

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,970
first

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,180
we're gonna add a new color variable to

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,580
use inside the card we're gonna make the

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,740
cut of the links in the card purple in

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,800
pattern fry all of the CSS values we use

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,120
a first assigned to variables we

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,570
recommend doing the same when making

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,910
customizations in your application so

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,640
navigate to your my app file in editor

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:47,370
and inside of the root block make a new

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,380
variable name called my app Cod same

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,750
color and assign it to be the hex color

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,460
for purple so you can see Jen's just

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,650
grab that line of code there and paste

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,300
it inside of the root walk this is

00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,810
because this is a global variable right

00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,810
we've just created

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,250
so second we're gonna override the

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,900
global link color so in our current

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,540
example of the card the buttons in the

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,920
photo use this global link color and we

00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,660
can reassign the border link color

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,460
variable to use our new custom color

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,350
variable so that all the properties that

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,100
use the global link color variable in

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,960
the card will now use this color so

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,740
inside of your card block within the my

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,390
app file set the global variable to use

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,330
the new value defined as a custom

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:34,120
variable so Jen's just grab that piece

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,980
of code underneath hint and she's scoped

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,450
that to the card component this is

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,580
because we're overwriting the global

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,620
link color specifically for the card if

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,600
we had the global link color at the root

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,040
we'd be modifying all of their link

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,300
colors across the entire application

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,090
which we don't want is everyone good at

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,860
a stage

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,390
okay so the third step is to change the

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,210
front size of the title in the cod

00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,850
header not all changes require custom

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,039
CSS many components include modifier

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:07,120
classes that enable you to customize the

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,679
appearance component so for this update

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,980
we're going to use a modified class

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,740
available for the title component so go

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,990
back to your index file and you can

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,299
actually command or control F in that

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,850
editor window to search for a piece of

00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:25,899
ass from the tax tracing of code so

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:28,870
Jen's just typing in PFC title space pfm

00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,850
medium you could also copy doesn't line

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,419
of code that you can copy in such

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,490
trouble but yeah so you should see that

00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,559
string of text highlighted now and the

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,169
idea is that we're changing the modified

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,980
class associated with the title from

00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:46,240
medium to extra-large and then yeah if

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,039
it doesn't reload you might just have to

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,299
add a space sometimes we have trouble

00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,840
with the reloading or you can

00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:57,580
right-click and iframe you

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,580
or maybe out of space after PF m XR

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,190
I can't tell ya I think that changed

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,010
sorry

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,260
so yeah so this is so some of the

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,270
tougher classes that Jen was mentioning

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,850
earlier we have horrified classes that

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,110
are associated with those classes so for

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,180
like title for example there's a

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,570
modified cross from extra small to to

00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,570
excel

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,230
and when the browser reloads hopefully

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,230
you will see a call about this

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,870
okay we're on so if except three we're

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,570
going to extend a pattern flight

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,710
component to achieve a new design so now

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,870
that we've practiced overwriting

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,400
variables let's practice extending

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,620
pattern PI system to create a new

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,800
element in the card first we're going to

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,890
add a separator element so we need to

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,990
add the HTML markup so in your index

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,670
file we're gonna add the HTML markup for

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,950
the separator element and it's gonna be

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,480
a sibling to the card buddy so that

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,060
means we want it to sit inside of the

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,190
card header and the card buddy as well

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,190
as the Cod buddy and the Cod footer so

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,440
when you're copying in this block of

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,470
code for the separator make sure that

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,140
you put it inside of after the header

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,210
tag and and before the body tag and then

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,510
off to the body tag and then before the

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,250
footer tag so then yeah you only maybe

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:17,240
just highlight way out of the separators

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,890
it yeah yeah and so the class name that

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,570
we've given this separator starts with

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:24,950
my app just as an easy way to

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:29,210
differentiate between EF or is it that

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:31,640
you're creating so once that HTML markup

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,290
is added in there we need no need to add

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,780
the variables associated to this class

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:39,590
so that we can style the separator

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:41,390
so the first fire boom we're gonna add

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,510
is for height and it's going to use pod

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,950
reverb available for small border width

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,120
and it should go under the variable

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,980
declarations inside of the card block so

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,930
Jenna's gonna grab that she's gonna add

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,290
a new line in the card book and then

00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:59,240
she's copy and pasted the variable for

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,530
the height for the separator and again

00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,480
they just start to the card block

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,110
because the card has the separator

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
element inside of it

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,640
okay so the next available we want to

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,980
add is for your background pilot so

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,300
Jen's copying that line of code there

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,660
and then she's gonna place it inside of

00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,040
the card and you can also see the naming

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,250
techniques that we've used that Jen

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,630
mentioned in the sides before and the

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,710
third variable we're going to use in the

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:30,930
card is our module so copy that line and

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,930
then paste it into the card love to

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,570
and nothing should happen in your iframe

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,919
right now because we haven't set the

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:43,669
variables yeah

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,169
we've only declared them so for step 5

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:49,850
we're gonna assign the variables for the

00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:51,799
separator element so we're gonna add

00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,809
this as a new block onto the card block

00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,250
so basically when you declare the

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,110
variables they're not actually set to

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,190
the properties that are gonna be in the

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,809
separator element and if you grab that

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,549
block of code and paste it under there

00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,960
you'll see we have a property for

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:07,879
background color and that's set to the

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,220
background color variable same thing for

00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:12,259
height and then for the margin we wanted

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,200
it on the right the bottom and the left

00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:16,730
and on the top so we've repeated that

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
margin variable three times

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,010
so that we could add it to those three

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,980
properties

00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,440
and hopefully when you reload your

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,250
browser you should see the copy like

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,250
that with the separate elements

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,419
[Music]

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,070
good okay so now for step four we're

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,710
going to add a pattern for class for the

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,570
layout so now that we've updated the car

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,609
design we're gonna add several cards and

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,039
then use a gallery layout and organize

00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:48,659
them using a gutter so we've kind of

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,279
done the work for you if you click the

00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,549
copy to editor button for that code book

00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,499
you don't now copy and paste four

00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:58,109
different cards in your index file so

00:25:55,499 --> 00:26:00,330
Jen's just going through them and so

00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:04,139
layout classes and butterfly are super

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,669
easy to use that's just like one or two

00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:08,009
steps of copying and pasting and then

00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,320
being able to add a layout so in this

00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:13,339
case scroll down in the content side and

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,339
we're going to go to step two

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,220
Louis I

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,509
and so what we want to do so sometimes

00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:30,489
when you add my out classes you'll add

00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,840
them to the component all the times

00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,460
you'll create a wrapper around the

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,279
component and then you're a Bible layout

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,360
inside of Rodd so in this case since

00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,009
we're over these cards we're going to

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,529
create a wrapper around the cards where

00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:44,619
we could add our layout so Jen's just

00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:46,570
adding an opening div tag to the top and

00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:49,379
the very bottom of the file she's adding

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,379
a closing div tag

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,019
so now that we have this procurement

00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,080
wrapper that's around the cards we can

00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,289
add a crosses to it that have styles

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,289
compared to it

00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:08,070
so Jen's happy and you can also see this

00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,650
on the content you can copy and paste

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:14,580
div class equals pfl gallery which is

00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,580
what about gallery layouts

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,809
and so we're not reloads you should see

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,840
the cards are lined up like this

00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:25,269
the Galileo uses our grid styles and

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,740
then it uses grade columns - I think

00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:33,639
it's 250 pics same amount but over with

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:37,179
I mean like out the pertinence classes

00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:39,100
also have modifier classes that are used

00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:40,299
with them so for example the gallery

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,860
class has

00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,690
I've got a modifier that you can use

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,529
with the gallery to create spaces in

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,529
between the cards

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,010
and

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,900
yeah yeah it's really really faint but

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,900
there should be spaces in between the

00:27:52,900 --> 00:28:00,309
cards there if you scroll down and this

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:04,059
should be yes space I really can see you

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:08,530
know your buzzer but um space on the top

00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:11,470
and between the cards and so that is the

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,450
end of our workshop but as we said we

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,920
have four proper ones that were testing

00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,260
out right now so if you want to learn

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,400
more about how to ride and yeah

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:23,750
definitely check out the booths outside

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,750
and if so does anyone have any questions

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,799
am i showing

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:41,710
thanks for your talk thank you very nice

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,810
I had a question about the structure of

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,910
the HTML that's like I see a lot of dish

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:49,660
I was wondering why an optimize a card

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:51,490
on an article for example why is it card

00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,380
another article instead of a deflector

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:57,930
mentally speaking the layout seems

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,930
rather it has a lot of dish

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:13,580
[Music]

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,500
wouldn't affect my styling it just

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,950
worked exactly the same if ITIF I pick

00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,950
an article

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,020
cool thank you

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,860
I've component we have an example in a

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,390
website where it's using the nav HTML

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,130
markup and then it's also using Gibbs

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,550
so that whichever context you need it in

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,550
you can grab it

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,100
if that's a little bad we'll wrap it up

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,160
but thank you everyone for listening to

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,160
us

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:56,079
