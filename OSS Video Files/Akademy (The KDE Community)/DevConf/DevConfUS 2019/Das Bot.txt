Description: 
	Speaker: Tomislav Mesic

No it's not about techno hit from the 90s and it's not about movie classic with the same name. It's about how to make superpower and intelligent Chatbot based on node.js, Azure Bot Framework, LUIS, Text Analytic Cognitive Service and some other stuff. Anyway ... totally crazy thing.

During this session we will build movie Bot from the ground using and combining several important components like Language Understanding, Text Analytics API and The Movie Database API. At the end, Bot will be hosted and published on Microsoft Azure platform.
