Title: Akka and Kubernetes, Building Clustered Systems
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Hugh McKee

One of the best features of Akka is Akka Cluster. Akka cluster allows for building distributed applications, where one application or service spans multiple nodes. From its initial release in 2013, Akka Cluster needed a node management system to manage the Akka nodes and to provide a resilient and elastic platform. With Kubernetes Akka finally has the node management system that is has been waiting for. Akka Cluster has been designed to gracefully handle nodes leaving and joining a running cluster while continuing to run. Kubernetes adds and removes nodes as needed to increase capacity or to recover from failures. In this talk, we will look at and demonstrate how Akka Java Cluster and Kubernetes work together and how together they form a beautiful relationship.
