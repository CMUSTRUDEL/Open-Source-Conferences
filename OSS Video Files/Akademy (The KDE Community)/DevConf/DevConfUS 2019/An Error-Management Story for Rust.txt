Unlike C, which uses error codes, or Python, which uses exceptions, both of which require no effort on the programmer's part to ignore, Rust requires any function that may return an error to encode this in its return type. To cause their code to ignore an error, the programmer must take an action, visible in the resulting code. Consequently, the programmer inclines toward more conscientious error-handling.

However, no fully accepted error-management solution for Rust has emerged. This presents a painful obstacle to programmers wishing to supply useful debugging information for programmers and helpful error information for users. In this talk, I will present the current state of error-management in Rust, the reasons for the difficulties, and my efforts to arrive at a workable solution.
