Description: 
	Speaker: Waiman Long

Control group (cgroup) and namespace are the two major features in
the Linux kernel that make containers possible. The original cgroup
v1 allows different process hierarchies for different controllers.
That makes it hard for different controllers to coordinate their
effort together. The new cgroup v2, on the other hand, forces all the
controllers to operate under a unified process hierarchy. This makes
it possible to provide features that are not possible under cgroup v1.

This presentation focuses on what cgroup v2 can bring to the table,
the difference between cgroup v1 and v2 and their pros and cons.
