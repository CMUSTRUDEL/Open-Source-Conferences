	Speaker: Andrew Jeddeloh

The Fedora CoreOS boot process is key to supporting some of its more interesting features. This talk walks through the Fedora CoreOS boot process from the bootloader up to running a container. It discusses how atomic updates and automatic rollback work under the hood via its GRUB configuration, how Ignition is used to configure the system in the initramfs, how Afterburn applies per-boot configuration such as networking, and how greenboot determines if the boot is successful.
