Title: Interpreting CPU Performance Measurement Counters
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Ulrich Drepper

All modern CPUs have at least a few ways to get information about the performance of the currently running code. Desktop and especially server CPUs have an overwhelming number of events that can be counted. What can be counted and measured is tightly coupled to the CPU implementation and without understanding how a modern CPU is constructed. This will take as an example a modern Intel CPU, explain the CPU architecture, and then look and the PMCs and how they can be used.
