Description: 
	Speakers: Miroslav Jaros and Stefan Bunciak

Lively development of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications is one of the hot topics in the current technology area. However, design, implementation and testing of these systems bring also many challenges and these challenges have to be responded by proper effective methods. In this talk, we will show you some of those problems in the Quality Assurance and testing area. Then, we will introduce you the PatrIoT framework, the cutting-edge project that aims to solve some of these challenges. The PatrIoT provides a possibility of easy to use integration testing of IoT applications, a flexible build of system testbed using simulation components or a set of special model-based testing methods to design effective test cases for an IoT system.
