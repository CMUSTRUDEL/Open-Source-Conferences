Title: Common Criteria Demystified
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Common Criteria Demystified
Speakers: Steven Grubb, Mark Thacker
Description:  What do you feel when you hear the term "Common Criteria"? Do you perceive
it as something complex and scary? It doesn't need to be. After attending
this talk, you will have a clear picture of what Common Criteria is, when,
why and how it is used, why it matters, and what is your role as a
developer in the process of acquiring Common Criteria Certification.
Equipped with this knowledge, you will better appreciate all that goes into
Common Criteria and how it makes products more secure.

hello my name is Steve Grove I work on

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,470
common criteria you know the broad head

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,689
of a security engineering group I've

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,999
done six Common Criteria evaluations

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:26,279
over the years and I have a mark Thakur

00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:31,289
here is going to help present some of

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,000
this yeah the product manager

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,920
responsible for security you might have

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,540
Enterprise Linux and I'm gonna be

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,140
talking as we go through Steve's gonna

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,930
go in a deep dive about fairness and the

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,250
very specific definitions you know take

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,800
you through just a very quick summary of

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,930
where we are today in Red Hat with

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,420
welcome criteria where we're headed into

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,710
the future as well thinking about it

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,650
some of this may be the first time I

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,650
publicly said it so to get sean-nÃ³s

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,280
okay so this talk is intended to be sort

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,140
of a common criteria 101 you know if you

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,110
don't really know much about Common

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:16,110
Criteria that's kind of the level of

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:18,500
what this talk is doing that and what

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,820
we're going to go through is basically

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,729
the different parts of the security

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,860
target protection profile we'll deliver

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,720
some of the terminology and then we'll

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,100
you'll pull it all together about you

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,270
know one in evaluation is and what it

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,549
does and then I head back over to mark

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,880
so to get some sort of frame of

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,400
reference let's listen them to a

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,210
conversation a fictitious conversation

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,210
with a salesperson and a customer

00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,469
you tried out our new XYZ OS no why

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:06,659
should I

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:12,720
it's so secure how secure Jerry prove it

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:14,010
okay what would it take to prove it I'd

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
like to see independent third-party

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,260
review that includes a code review

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,780
testing review of the development

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,730
process a list of security features and

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,489
the threats they counter security

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,380
guidance so I can lock it down and a

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:35,340
vulnerability assessment so that I know

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:37,260
to catch everything is that all maybe

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,739
some penetration testing because bad

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,280
guys do that too sounds like a lot of

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:49,980
work maybe so but serious claims demand

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:52,489
series proof so what does our sales guy

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,530
gonna do what's a company gonna do well

00:02:52,489 --> 00:03:01,109
unbeknownst to him the customer just

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,579
specified common criteria common

00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,660
criteria is the internationally agreed

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,120
upon set of requirements that

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,880
facilitates comparability between

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,190
security evaluations sets a common set

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,040
of requirements for functionality with a

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,079
certain product type and it requires a

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,480
certain assurance measures to be applied

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,480
during the development and evaluation

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,970
this is sort of a visual concept of what

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,980
what this is happening here and instead

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,419
of owners you know which owners would be

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,829
the purchaser

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,849
I would rather substitute the word

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,590
developer you know into this and so

00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:47,069
developers impose countermeasures to

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,079
reduce risk to assets the customer owns

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,859
assets they don't want the bad things

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:56,340
that happen to owners you know wish wish

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,940
to minimize risk and owners value their

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,100
assets meanwhile we have threat agents

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,120
that give rise to threats that increase

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,300
risk

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:12,569
to assets and the threat agents wish to

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:15,049
abuse and/or me damage those assets so

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:17,400
let's take a look at some common terms

00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,079
acronyms and terms used in common

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,540
criteria because these slides are gonna

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,710
have have all of this on it and just

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,120
want to make sure that you guys familiar

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,419
with some of these terms before you see

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,729
the slides first one is toe which is the

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,610
target of evaluation and what that means

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:37,080
is it's the hardware with the software

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:39,930
installed protection profile this is a

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,950
set of requirements for a product type

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,440
and we'll discuss this in more detail st

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,389
is a security target and what that is is

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:55,460
a customization of the protection

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:58,620
profile for a specific product tsf is

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,820
the target of evaluations security

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,770
functionality SFR is a word we're going

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,419
to run across a lot it means the

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,419
security function requirements

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,449
a couple more terms developer the

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,789
company makes a product scheme that's

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,190
the government agency that sets the

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,449
security rules there's there's several

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,780
schemes you know like na F is in the

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,150
United States BSI is in Germany Spain

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:34,169
and turkey Italy you know now France

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:39,300
Canada they all have schemes also that

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:41,729
set those security rules assurance this

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,139
is the confidence that software is free

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,120
from vulnerabilities either

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:54,120
intentionally designed into the software

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:57,780
or I accidentally inserted okay so when

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,120
you get into the security target one of

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,770
the production profile one of the

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,289
introductory sections is about threats

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,479
and this is an important section to be

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,370
able to take a look at because this

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,069
tells you what the people that wrote the

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,509
protection profile had in mind when they

00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:17,039
when they wrote it so the definition is

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,080
that a threat consists of adverse

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,520
actions performed by a threat agent on a

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:27,990
set there's an example that I have here

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:32,310
that says T local attack do you mean a

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,750
threat what this particular one says is

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,479
that an attacker made compromised

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,009
applications running on the OS the

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,800
compromised application may provide

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,240
malicious formatted input to the OS

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,180
through a variety of channels including

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,969
I'm protocols and messaging via the file

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,830
system so this would be you know

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,779
something that that they wanted to

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,880
counter this is a threat they saw you

00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,889
know to the to the operating system and

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:01,199
so you know this is one of the things

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:03,659
that they list another section is going

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,460
to be assumptions and this is the

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:07,710
accepted beliefs around the operating

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,979
environment that the security function

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:14,099
will not address like for example down

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:16,620
at the bottom we have a proper admin and

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,810
what this basically says is that the

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,569
admin of the OS is not careless

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,099
willfully negligent or hostile

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,889
and the administrators of the US will

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,539
within compliance of the applied

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,149
enterprise security policy so what that

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:32,639
would mean is that all the security

00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:36,020
measures are not intended to protect

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,020
against the malicious admin

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,660
another section in the in the beginning

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:50,120
is the security objectives this is a

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,320
concise and abstract statement of the

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,990
intended solution to the threat I have

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,900
an example here from OS P P called the

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,850
protected comms this one says that to

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,220
address both passive eavesdropping an

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,050
active packet modification network

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,180
attack threats conformant OSS provide

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,340
mechanisms to create trusted channels in

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,330
other words it's an encrypted that they

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:23,270
want you to use cryptography to protect

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:26,240
the communication okay so once you get

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,130
past this introductory section you you

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,190
finally get to something called SF RS

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:35,960
which is the more concrete things that

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:39,740
you're expected to do as a developer the

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,080
SF r is our tweet our translation of the

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,849
security objective into a detailed and

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,830
complete level of extraction but

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,960
independent from a specific solution and

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,970
the reason that that they do it this way

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,610
is so that they can say that they want

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,620
us a certain kind of protection but

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,220
Microsoft has the leeway to solve it

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,550
their way

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,350
Linux vendors can solved their way

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:03,230
Macintosh can solve it their way so they

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,660
they don't specify a complete solution

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,040
but they give they give something that

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:14,300
we can all do and and an example from

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,100
Common Criteria part 2 they have a

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,150
requirement here that says when the

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,220
defined number of unsuccessful

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,010
authentication attempts has been and

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:26,980
then you have a selection it says met

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:32,530
ORS path then the tsf shall do something

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,530
so this is not very detailed

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,140
okay so the the SFR is is really the

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,690
meat of Common Criteria and this shows

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,630
all the different families of security

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,960
functionality that that the catalog has

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,450
so Common Criteria part two is a huge

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,580
catalog of all these different security

00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:03,860
functionalities and within these

00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:20,030
families there's a lot more yes there's

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:21,340
a lot more so okay so the major ones

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,690
that you would run across in a

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,520
protection profile is is under

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,650
protection of tsf and user data

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:33,320
protection you know like for example

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:35,240
access control policy this one is one

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,620
that would define your permissions on

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,650
files and and being able to access

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,650
things but in any event I just wanted

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,290
any event I just wanted to show you that

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,050
that there's a lot of different kinds of

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:53,150
requirements you know in in the catalog

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,130
but you don't have to know about all

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,380
these things because normally you run

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,790
across a protection profile which is

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,570
already pre-selected the ones that you

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,570
that you need to care about

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:09,800
speaking of protection profile a

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,220
protection profile was intended to

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,010
describe a type of a product

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,680
it contains the threats objectives

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,280
assumptions everything that this kind of

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,790
product may encounter the people that

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,740
rate protection profiles is generally a

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,330
government that is specifying its

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,870
requirements as part of the acquisition

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,870
process

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,360
there's a lot of different protection

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,360
profiles out there there's probably 30

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,490
or 40 of them just just under nyah and

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,530
what it is I just wouldn't picked a few

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,270
of them to just give you a feel for the

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,350
different kinds of protection profiles

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:56,440
that are out there application software

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:59,980
that's to address things like a Java

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,540
server or a Java servlet then there's

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,080
operating system protection profile

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,000
which is the one that that I care about

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,280
there's full disk encryption network

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,170
device there's a protection profile if

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,060
you want to be a firewall if you want to

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,290
be a VPN gateway there's one for that if

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,180
you want to be a multi-function printer

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,100
there's one for those mobile devices

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:23,230
these things go through a common

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:25,030
criteria also a USB flash drive the one

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,230
you had that thing goes to the common

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,520
criteria

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:36,880
smart cards VoIP all these things can go

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:41,140
through common criteria a security

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:45,940
target is is a further detailing of the

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:47,560
of the pp and it explains how you know

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,640
this combination of software and

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,830
hardware meets the security objectives

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,810
in this it talks about exact

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,490
technologies like SM you learn expand

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,530
the kernel you know at this point this

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,540
is this is really clear you go from the

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:05,530
abstract to you know this is how we're

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,300
gonna solve the problem the other thing

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,430
too about the security target is it

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,040
serves as a basis of agreement between

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,770
the developer and the evaluator on the

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,280
exact security properties and exact

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,020
scope of an evaluation so in other words

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,910
when when a company writes a security

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,920
target they give this to the lab and

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,920
this is what the lab tests exactly

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,880
okay and one last thing to talk about

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:40,260
here is that yes as we saw in that

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,790
example of the ESFR there are electives

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,990
you know where somebody has to make

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:49,760
decisions about how how this requirement

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:52,560
is met and I have an example down here

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,540
that shows the before and after like

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,770
this this section here in the middle

00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,190
comes straight out of the Common

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,260
Criteria catalog which you know it's the

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,280
same requirement we saw earlier and when

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,260
a defined number of unsuccessful

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,960
authentication attempts has been then

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:11,130
selection met or surpassed then the tsf

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:13,080
shall do something so it was it was

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,220
refined in the actual security target to

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,680
say when the defined number of

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,600
unsuccessful authentication attempts has

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,080
been met the TSF shell disabled user

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,480
logged logon account until it is renamed

00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,830
by the authorized administrator so you

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,520
see how it gives you some room and then

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,940
you know you you tell how its solved

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,120
normally there's one step in between and

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,670
that is that the the scheme takes the

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,930
out of the catalog and then they do some

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,430
selections in other words there's just

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,350
this assignment where it says list of

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,030
actions they go ahead and populate that

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,860
list with the things they would like to

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,750
see you do in other words they kind of

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,550
give you a hint in how they want to see

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,730
it solved and then you have to pick from

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,730
that list

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,250
okay one one other set of requirements

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,750
these are the ones that we normally

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,970
don't like and this is the assurance

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,810
requirements which describe what the

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:19,560
evaluator will do to confirm that the SF

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:23,020
RS is met it also specifies things like

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,950
you have to use get or some kind of

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,990
version control system and specifies you

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,230
know other things like training you know

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,430
of staff and locks on doors to make sure

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,560
that people just can't come in and

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,440
commit code so there's a lot of things

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,230
to a surety assurance activities but

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,080
there's some that are specific to the SF

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,970
ARS and I have some examples here just

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,700
to show you you know the nature of

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,170
what's expected and it says you know the

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,310
evaluator will attempt to modify all

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,490
shared libraries that are used

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,990
throughout the system and you know if if

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,279
the system is designed right you know

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,440
the files are owned by root and you

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,440
can't modify anything as a common user

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:10,510
okay so to tie all this together the

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,450
developer or a company picks a

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,220
protection profile that protection

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,700
profile is supported by a specific

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,649
scheme which you know means a nation the

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,839
scheme has accredited a number of labs

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,630
that it tests periodically to verify

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,850
their capabilities that Evolver

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,829
contracts a lab to conduct the

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,020
evaluation of the security target

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:34,649
following the assurance activities to

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,270
prove that the toe counters the threats

00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:40,510
the lab then conducts these tests and

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,850
submits paperwork to the scheme scheme

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,370
reviews the documents and if everything

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,820
is good they issued the report out of

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,230
the certificate otherwise they they tell

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,420
the lab that there's some problems and

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,250
it goes back to the developer where they

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,550
may have to do more testing and

00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,430
documentation and you know ultimately

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,880
you know as a certificate is issued

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,160
then all signatory countries to the

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:13,720
mutual recognition tree accept this

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:18,250
evaluation okay so how can developers

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,049
help for the product type that you have

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,140
you know you'd want to find the

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:25,000
protection profile if one exists because

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,439
you know not everything exists like for

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,850
example in containers there is no

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,000
protection profile for containers at

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,230
this point but if you work on firewalls

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,929
you know there is definitely a

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,419
protection profile for that so what you

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,240
want to do is look at the s FRS and see

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:41,710
if if you if their product already meets

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,710
them all or you can configure it to meet

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,270
them all if the I so far has electives

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,980
then you want to try to provide as broad

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,690
coverage as possible so that secured

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,330
target writer can claim as much as

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:55,090
possible so in other words in the

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,919
cryptography section they may list you

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,809
know ten different ciphers you know that

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,130
are acceptable and so what you would

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,049
probably want to do is to try and

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,970
support all ten of them if you can so

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,580
you can claim out telephone I mean you

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,650
might be able to get by on one or two

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,730
but the market probably is you know your

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,919
competitors are probably going to

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:17,380
support all ten so that's that's how you

00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,659
can help is to read read the P P look at

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,940
the s frac to me some if not fix you

00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,900
know do something to meet it and try to

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,990
provide as much coverage as possible

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,860
okay so I'm going to take you through

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,179
just real quick

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,490
in the remaining time that we have

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,520
available about where we are with Common

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,380
Criteria today Steve I already kind of

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,960
set this up but if you're a developer in

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,470
the room almost an obvious question yeah

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,570
that's great for why should I care

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,270
there's lots of reasons number one

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,419
because our customers everybody has

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,940
customers require comma criteria

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:57,309
it's a purchasing requirement and given

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,929
two products of equal capability the one

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,970
with common criteria certification is

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,309
the one that they will buy one that they

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,530
must buy especially in the US and really

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,600
situations it's just plain man

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,550
they just have to buy near the reason

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,010
why she care other people are doing it

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,350
right other vendors are doing it but

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,750
most importantly as a developer because

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,400
of all of those reasons you worked

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,380
really hard on your code and you want

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,600
your technology to be in the hands of

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,900
people that actually want to use it thus

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,380
you care about Common Criteria

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,880
so where are we today Red Hat's been

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,830
doing coming criteria for a very long

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
time and generally for the operating

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,180
system we have picked the general

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,170
purpose operating system protection

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:45,850
profile GPO SPP and we have actually

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:50,770
evaluated rel seven twice against OS PP

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:53,740
version 2.0 and OS PP 3.9 on Intel x86

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:57,190
64 and IBM power architectures

00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:01,530
now anyone want to tell me how old 7.1

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:04,750
is it's yeah it's actually end-of-life

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:07,480
right yeah you cannot get support from

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,220
red have any more on 7.1 in practice in

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,070
the field typically what we find is

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,490
customers will use our predictor are a

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:18,160
rather our security target and the

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,520
report that came out of evaluation as a

00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,380
continuation and a justification for you

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,160
for using newer versions of the

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,260
operating system however we're moving

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,940
for it so there's been a lot of changes

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,070
in the u.s. in particular we're on

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,170
Common Criteria and we have a new

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,500
general purpose operating system

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:41,230
protection profile version 4.2 the nice

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,260
part about this evaluation process under

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,930
4.2 and amelia is this extremely fast

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,510
what I mean by extremely fast okay we're

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:54,820
talking Common Criteria definition of

00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:56,650
extremely fast now it we are required

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,030
once we actually formally enter into

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,520
certification to complete the

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:05,500
certification within 180 days typically

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:07,860
90 280 days this 7.1 evaluation I was

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,390
born I guess when we started it

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:16,260
it took two years two years to actually

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,120
go through evaluation alright two years

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,760
hundred eighty days Wow it's like

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,620
Lightspeed buddy so it's a lot faster

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,600
now I'm real - what that really means is

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,100
there were significant changes to how

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,679
the evaluation process is being

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,960
conducted is much more automated and

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,809
test driven now so the bullet line that

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,940
was the lab conducts the tests gathers

00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,100
the report and then submits it that

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,740
whole process is now significantly more

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,740
audited and more automatable than it

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,950
used to be as a result of that however

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:50,460
this is a new schema and there are some

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:54,029
limitations for example under 7.6 no one

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,880
in the world rather - there is no such

00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,720
concept as mandatory access control you

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,340
cannot test SELinux under OSP p4i -

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,159
doesn't exist there's no concept of

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,289
mandatory access control that's gonna be

00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,940
a problem long term because we have

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:10,889
customers that use I don't know

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,320
containers with SELinux is you in the

00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:15,510
last time and also if you're into

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,429
labeling like MLS environments you need

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,260
selinux mandatory access control so

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:23,279
Steve and other people are working on

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,929
creating enhancement to OS PP that

00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,760
hopefully will be accepted by the high

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,130
up and others so that we can in the

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,559
future evaluate against mandatory access

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,100
control good news now is actually no one

00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,460
in the u.s. under Oh speedy can also

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,740
mandatory access control so 7s6 we are

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,690
in the process of becoming fully in

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,909
evaluation and talking about that more

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,500
publicly but this is the target that is

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:50,149
something that we're actively working on

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:54,350
right now what about moving forward rel

00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:57,870
8.0 is designed from the beginning to be

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,909
Common Criteria certifiable I did not

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,639
say that we were certifying a Tod zero

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,620
because this is a major new release we

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:07,500
want to make sure if there's any issues

00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,299
we shake it out right in the operating

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,549
system and in the protection profile

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,290
itself so for example one of the things

00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:17,170
have changed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux

00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:19,590
eight is TLS 1.3 there were at least two

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:23,590
talks on TLS 1.3 in this room today

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:27,010
TLS 1.3 is not covered under the OSP P

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:31,450
4.2 that we're using for l76 so there

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:35,380
will likely be an OS PP 4.3 that will

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:38,410
include TLS 1.3 support so the plan is

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,900
that we will target the next minor

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,280
release of rl8 I guess I'm not

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,340
technically supposed to tell you what

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:48,070
number that would be but point some

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,500
number greater than zero on the end that

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,960
would be our target for comment criteria

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,970
for rel eight and as I was mentioning

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,180
earlier we're going to be eddie

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,990
mandatory access control and for example

00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:04,330
under new OS VP for to secure boot is an

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,280
absolute requirement UEFI secure boot is

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,970
a requirement IBM power systems

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,470
currently don't do secure boot they have

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,480
other ways of making sure their

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,920
environment is skewer but they don't do

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,910
secure view they literally cannot be

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,230
evaluated under this model as of today

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,630
hands what's going on in the hardware

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,400
side there's maybe some things that we

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:28,300
might be able to do in the protection

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,790
profile as well so I have my own what's

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,530
what's next for you so learn about comma

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,300
criteria you're here today of learning

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,730
about it if any of you are working on

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,590
leave our layered products

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,300
openshift directory products identity

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,940
management products virtualization

00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,920
infrastructure look again as Steve

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,150
indicated is our protection profile

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,230
that's interesting for you

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,820
if so then let's talk right we have most

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,730
of the common criteria experts here in

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,590
this room if your developer involved

00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,720
anywhere in what we call our target of

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,050
evaluation the toe which is basically

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,580
downing the kernel just be aware what

00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,530
you working on is what's being evaluated

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,170
to five-seven just before we aware of

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,240
that and with that I think we actually

00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:14,350
stopped exactly one oh look at that

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,000
the third is that 525 we are at the end

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:22,950
so thank you for waiting on questions

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,950
you guys have any questions for us yes

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,720
good question

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,800
yeah so it doesn't really matter what it

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,260
touches or does not touch let's look at

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,850
the line I didn't read the evaluation

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,100
only applies to the operating system

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:52,370
itself not their product so by

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,720
definition no now it doesn't inherit so

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,300
for example you could not claim what

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,650
common ansible is coming criteria sorry

00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,420
fraud because it's running on a common

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,309
criteria certified version of relative

00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,620
no that doesn't work that that

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:07,100
inheritance doesn't work now what does

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,080
work is something like FIPS where you're

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,179
not inheriting FIP certification for

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,850
ansible but you can claim hey look the

00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,970
new version of ansible has been made to

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:19,730
run in a mode where if rel is in FIPS

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,870
mode the Nance will used nothing but

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,030
fits validated cryptographic

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,309
cryptographic routines if not that

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:28,220
ansible itself has fits validator or fit

00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:30,200
certified none of those words apply it

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,960
is compatible with rel ring and fit

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,400
right so comma criteria no it's the

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,470
certification does not automatically

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,030
inherit to emulate product that's where

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,950
you get into interesting conversations

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,429
like our read product Red Hat

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:45,590
virtualization it's based on rel oh but

00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,990
it doesn't apply immediately right

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,920
because it doesn't inherit upstream also

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,470
there's actually a virtualization

00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,940
protection profile so now you're into a

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,410
different user space the different use

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,770
space you need a different protection

00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,770
profile

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:05,940
it does cause confusion well actually

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,540
there's there's nowhere to hang claims

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:13,050
on containers and OSP before that to

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:16,320
underthe OSTP 2.0 which is the old ei L

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:19,800
style of evaluations there there were

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,080
protection of the t SF requirements

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,780
there and so you can hang claims there

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,270
saying that you know provides a process

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:32,730
isolation but you know you come at it

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:34,790
from that angle you know but you know

00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,950
I've also been talking with nya about

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,690
how we could do a certification of

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,010
containers and what their initial

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,050
thoughts are is that you know it's

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,340
another kind of virtualization so what

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,110
we want to do is take a look at

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,090
virtualization protection profile and

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,910
start with that throw away things that

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,320
don't really sense for containers and

00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,360
throw you know add some things back to

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,710
it that are specific to containers but

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,960
you know generally follow the

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,330
virtualization protection profile and

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,040
write a security target and then if we

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,260
go successful in evaluating that

00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,970
security target come to my app and say

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,740
hey this this could be a protection

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:11,010
profile that everybody has to meet and

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,840
they would consider that as a as a new

00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,400
baseline you know there right now

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,400
they're looking you know I'm looking at

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,170
the industry to figure out you know how

00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,320
what what to claim about security around

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:24,780
containers and I know Sean and I were

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,280
talking just this week another thing you

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,340
can do is there's a fairly broad

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,929
protection profile called application

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,900
he's actually about patient server

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:35,970
yeah and that's it's kind of a catch-all

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,800
category that we can classify a lot of

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,410
things in including the openshift as a

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,550
whole application might be a would get

00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,520
away with that it's a little different

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,320
because it doesn't treat doesn't treat

00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,809
like open shipped as a virtualization

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,010
platform there's a lot of leeway but the

00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:55,020
short answer to your question Dan is

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:57,980
yeah it causes confusion okay two more

00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,980
questions let's start back here

00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:10,330
security organization we just released

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:28,470
right so the question for the camera was

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,870
basically long-term maintenance of comma

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,290
criteria released operating systems

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,840
right

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,130
once you have maybe new CDs and patches

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,260
and we didn't say that but I assume

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,790
that's going to talk about how do you

00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,050
keep it up to date and how does that

00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,090
deal with certification on how a

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:46,290
certification deal with those changes

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:49,500
right yeah so what certified is exactly

00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:50,760
what we passed through the lab we can do

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,070
maintenance updates on that

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,460
certification so at certain points of

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:59,220
time we can take an rolled up patch set

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,929
and that's the lab and say look here's

00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,340
everything that's changed since the last

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:07,350
time that we certify this is what it did

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,450
or didn't do to the security target or

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,010
claims around what we certified and

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,860
typically that's a very fast kind of

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,679
recertification if you will of an update

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:22,280
of a batch release of a patch in reality

00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:26,940
an auditor at say a government agency

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:28,950
understands okay you certified this it's

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,660
been 90 days there's new patches we get

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,940
it you have to install those patches and

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,370
auditors generally will work with you

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,460
and the security target and understand

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,860
what's been changed but I don't know if

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,280
you have another I was going to point

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,280
out that

00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:55,480
[Music]

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:58,040
that kind of thing it just they also

00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,450
would like us to reevaluate within two

00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:05,180
years you know keep it fresh but they

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,030
expect updates and we going forward our

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,610
plane is with 71 for example you had two

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,590
valuations now we're doing an ATM seven

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:16,220
six going forward without being too

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:18,110
specific we intend to have no problem

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,330
with that less than every two years rule

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:46,790
I could get it down to once a year that

00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:48,560
would be really great job as he goes

00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,230
through certification

00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,660
all the time every couple of years all

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:58,040
the major releases JBoss go through

00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:00,500
certification other than that I you know

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,870
we have done the virtualization extended

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,170
module we've done the advanced audit

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,670
extended module in OS p p2 and that one

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,560
was designed so if you don't actually do

00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:13,490
another security target or protection

00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:16,220
profile but it was modular but you know

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,200
talkie or looking at competition like

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,120
for example Microsoft took Windows 10

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,780
through the firewall the VPN full disk

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:30,020
encryption and operating system so

00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,580
vendors do normally take their products

00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:36,560
through you know several things to cover

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:37,790
different aspects of the product we know

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,710
the redhead layered products are

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,220
evaluating it there honestly waiting

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:45,140
with business cases Reb has looked at it

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,580
OpenStack has looked at it we're in

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,690
active discussions around what to do

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,000
with openshift

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,890
since it's so railways and especially

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,060
moving forward it's still very much well

00:32:51,890 --> 00:33:25,490
based but yeah you've got the three that

00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:27,820
we can point to right now you know the

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,820
bride

00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:54,950
watching bugs upstream back but not as

00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:56,719
every see things happen but then what's

00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,759
tick tick you know we get the package

00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:00,469
you know a present to her for a while so

00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:02,210
we get a little bit of confidence that

00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:04,969
you know the package is in good shape

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,529
you know for running and vidura so they

00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:12,129
don't do it it comes into the realm and

00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:12,129
and when it comes to the roll through

00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:16,879
and so you know that goes through it and

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:18,169
gives us reports you know about all

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,579
kinds of different defects that the

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:27,789
other define but the same time we also

00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:34,339
different modules so we get tight on

00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:37,789
there is a checker and also works with

00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:41,539
CPP check and then also the compiler is

00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:44,980
working to add Diagnostics either so you

00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,980
know paint containers

00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:56,389
and so they felt fine some of the worst

00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:59,200
spots you know of course those patches

00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,200
go back upstream

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,860
[Music]

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,209
[Music]

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:57,200
but we run these scams and that we are

00:35:53,370 --> 00:36:04,100
out of time thank you guys

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,100
