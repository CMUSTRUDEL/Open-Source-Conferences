Title: Composer: Building OS images for any platform
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Composer: Building OS images for any platform
Speakers: Jenn Giardino, Will Woods
Description:  ntroducing Cockpit Composer, a new tool that lets you create, edit, and manage customized OS images over time. Create blueprints with custom selections of packages and modules from different source repositories. Then generate images from those blueprints for physical, virtual, and cloud environments. Learn about what features are currently available in the web UI, including how to select the content you need and how to create images. As part of this session, we want to take some time to get feedback from the audience on the flow of features presented and their image building needs.

it's good to see you all and thanks for

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,800
coming you were going to be talking

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,980
about composure which is our sort of new

00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,810
image build toolkit thing

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,109
yes building OS images for any platform

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,179
I'm will woods you may know me from my

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,310
various cussing about packaging formats

00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,849
and sneaking hot dogs into the operating

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,430
system and Jen you know ginger do you

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,530
know senior interaction designer on the

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:41,580
user experience design team and I work

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:43,980
on composure so here we have Terry he is

00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,140
a system cloud administrator and he

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,930
needs to quickly create customized OS

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,720
images for different types of

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,790
deployments and we have composer which

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,340
lets you build custom images for any

00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,770
platform this is our sort of

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,079
architecture overview what what is

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,820
composer well yeah it's a thing that

00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,220
lets you build stuff you take content

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,070
from various places from red hat or

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,780
fedora or wherever your own things third

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,720
parties and run it through the magic

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,590
composer box and outcomes the things

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:26,040
that you would want to install or run in

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:28,170
various platforms array and yeah it's

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,870
not like we wrote all new stuff to do

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,010
this as much as I may have wanted to

00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,040
it's using all of the tools that you

00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,590
know and love in a comedy enough behind

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,270
the scenes we've just given you new ways

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,270
to use these things made a lot easier

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,369
what it doesn't do the main thing that

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,740
we wanted to do here is make it easy to

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,530
make ready to ready to run ready to

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,510
deploy images the parts where you sort

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,840
of need to you know do a lot of

00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,369
customization once the image is built

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,830
we're not doing all of that we aren't

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,420
going to do everything for you not

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,670
because we don't love you we do love you

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,260
it's just that there are certain things

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,399
you can't do if you want to have a

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,769
mutable image that you're going to

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,410
deploy it in a thousand places we don't

00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,700
have a way of canoeing 1,000

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,900
configurations we can't do we can't

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,470
predict everything you want to do so

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,120
we're going to give you

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,580
the common tools to do the things that

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,700
you will need to do and there's lots of

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,250
great configuration tools to set up your

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,780
system once it's running but composer is

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,980
concerned with getting the thing that

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,250
you're going to run once it's running

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,250
that's good for other tools not for us

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,230
so yeah we're so here Jen's gonna walk

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:47,670
you through what it is and how it works

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:49,290
so composer is a plug-in inside of

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,570
cockpit not sure if you guys are

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,820
familiar with cockpit it's a web console

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,400
that lets you administer your system so

00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,330
when you see composer inside of cockpit

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,150
it's labeled as image builder and the

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,820
main page of image builder composer

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,890
is a list of blueprints that are

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,300
represent the different images you

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,240
maintain here we're going to go to this

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,250
HTTP server blueprint where you can see

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,890
these are the contents that I've already

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,950
added to this blueprint and I want to

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,190
make some changes to the blueprint one

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,690
of the things I want to do is get rid of

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,269
PHP so I'm gonna go ahead and remove

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:35,610
that one we're making some very smart

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:37,260
moves for for for terry terry has

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:44,850
decided that she does not want to use

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:46,110
PHP anymore good job Terry yes Jerry's

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,170
gonna add nodejs

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,959
to his blueprint so I filtered it I

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,540
found things related to note is here

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,530
I've added it to my blueprints

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,610
I can see notice here but there's also a

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,760
table of dependencies so just to see if

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,519
nodejs

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,970
also brings in in p.m. I can filter by

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,549
NPM and I see that it is in fact in my

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,280
blueprint pulled in automatically as a

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,699
dependency Terry is much relieved to

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,880
know that he has NPM now

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,949
so that's it for the changes I'm gonna

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,520
make to my blueprint I can see the

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:29,970
changes that I have made the ones listed

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,850
down here so I added our sink earlier

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,830
but I never saved that that was part of

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,540
the previous session these are the

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,690
changes that you saw me make now I'm

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,360
gonna go ahead and commit all of them if

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,470
I want it I could roll back some of

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,030
those changes and I do them but I'm

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,600
gonna go ahead and commit the ones that

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,190
I just created and if the idea of

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,840
committing changes sounds familiar to me

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,430
to you yes this is behind the scenes

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:04,320
keeping the blueprints in a little git

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:07,410
repository so this blueprint now is

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:12,090
something that I'm ready to to start

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,190
using I click create image and here you

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,990
can see a variety of choices available

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,820
to you for creating an image and yeah we

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,530
have all the you know all your favorites

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,680
of all of the image types that you might

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,410
want to build two different flavors of

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,360
qko to you note our archives if you just

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,060
like want to don't cram that into some

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,889
Dockery sort of thing we can probably

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,729
add more but these are the most common

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,020
things out in the world so and if you're

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,370
looking at that and being like oh but my

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,090
favorite isn't in there please do come

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,090
talk to us about it

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,150
so yeah Terry Terry loves qk2 so he's

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:54,330
gonna create a key count to when you

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,270
create images you would then go back to

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,520
this this sort of overview page for your

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,919
blueprint where you can see all of your

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,020
components as well as the the images

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,410
that you've created so this is the one

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,930
that I just selected it's it's kicked

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,669
off that process and then this is one

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:18,030
that I had previously created the VMDK

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:20,639
so we're kind of doing it like a cooking

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,139
show and sort of pulling me pulling it

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,060
out of the oven to show you and it works

00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,680
but while it's still baking the network

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,260
being what it is right now we're not

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,730
100% certain that it

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:38,510
be able to fetch stuff in time for you

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:41,060
to see what's going on yes we will

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,800
yeah there are ways to specify that will

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,570
show some details of the blueprints and

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,660
a little bit I don't think we have

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,580
suffered that in the UI yet but I think

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,890
we're actively working on it but I I do

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,380
have some activities at the uxd booth

00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,060
I'll be here tomorrow and Sunday and if

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,470
you have feedback and would love to come

00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,600
and take a look I would love for you to

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,100
come and take a look and just walk

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,740
through some of the some of those

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,630
activities and provide feedback yeah the

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,940
UX team is actively trying to design a

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,680
really good interface for how you find

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,820
those things and make those sorts of

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,140
changes so please do come talk to them

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,700
okay so yeah just sort of prove the

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,170
point we're going to you know take the

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:26,990
image that we built earlier and

00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:29,090
downloaded earlier and VirtualBox is

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,590
very clever and if you type Lin it it

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,480
says oh you're doing Linux if you type

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:38,170
machine it sees the MACC and thinks

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,170
you're running a Mac good job VirtualBox

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,270
but yeah so you know it's I forgot to

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,770
show you yeah so I had already

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,530
downloaded this one that I created

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,730
earlier sorry I have that file available

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:59,140
and then when I'm creating this VM you

00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:07,370
can see it's here and I can select that

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:11,420
creating that VM name it something other

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:20,960
than lynnie yeah lynnie to the real in

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:21,830
eing lynnie harder I'll go with Lani -

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,199
yeah

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,759
so yeah here we go it's gonna boot and

00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,310
you all know what a boot sequence looks

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,199
like it's not super exciting we can if

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,599
you want to switch over to the console

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,880
for a second we might be able to do we

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,070
want to risk right so there is a full

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,180
CLI to control this as well which we

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,039
would love to demonstrate but

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,370
unfortunately the network being what it

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,789
is

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:47,120
sometimes the CLI hangs but we'll show

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,600
you some of that in a little bit so yeah

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,870
there we go

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,089
this is the image that we built it works

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,560
any boot straight into it and I don't

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,720
think this one actually has NPM in it

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,410
sadly because we can't get it because

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,870
the network here is being very strange

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:09,800
so are we gonna try it all right well

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:11,000
yeah yeah so we've got we'll just bring

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,790
up the help screen just to let you know

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,970
like it's got a bunch of your usual sort

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:22,130
of thing and verb type commands to tell

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,899
it what sort of stuff you want to do and

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,060
there's nice tab completion so if you're

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,690
not sure what the name of the blueprint

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:33,800
or the compose you you IDs are very long

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,800
so it'll help you out and we'll see if

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,240
we can get status you can all right

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,730
start still running the bill for

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,209
OpenStack but it shows you all of the

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:48,740
builds that you are have either finished

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:50,360
or failed or running or pending yeah and

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,970
there's other commands but you don't

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,440
really want to watch us type it's not

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,000
great so just I'm gonna go back and do a

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,459
reminder some of you weren't in the room

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,020
when the screen was showing we do have a

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:06,740
few questions we want to get some

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,360
feedback from you guys on if you could

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,160
if you haven't already pulled up to

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,490
survey if you could pull it up and just

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,920
a few questions answer those and then in

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,019
a few minutes we'll pull up those

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,350
results at the very least weren't pretty

00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:23,089
sure that t-money Terry our boy will

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,380
answer these questions so if nobody else

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,829
answers we're just gonna talk about what

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,720
Terry wants to do and

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:34,079
I love Terry but not that much so yeah

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,910
in order to make the image when we build

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,019
an image out of these things normally

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,689
when you make an image run through the

00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,610
installer you have to create your user

00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:45,779
account set the root password things

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,160
like that so we did that through the

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,290
console when we were building this thing

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,610
earlier so you know this is just we can

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,129
list the blueprints that are on the

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,899
server um save a copy of the example

00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,089
HTTP server which we showed you and so

00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,739
you want to go to the next one so yeah

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,319
here's what the blueprint looks like

00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:02,759
it's not unexpected and you can set the

00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:04,949
exact version numbers and we've got

00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,860
we've got modules we've got packages you

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,029
can list what you need in there and so

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,480
it's got a list of the things that we

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:14,759
added in the UI not all the dependencies

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,860
but that comes later and so in order to

00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,610
you know we can add we edit a root user

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,059
or at a set a password and a key for for

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,470
Terry t-money and just put his key in

00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,319
there so the t-money can get into his

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,540
systems so we've got the root one we've

00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,980
got a user so that you've got a regular

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,899
user on the system and you know these

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,119
are the sorts of things you expect these

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,240
are the only there will be UI for this

00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:40,170
soon there isn't right now we're trying

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,089
to figure out what sorts of

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,679
customizations are the most important

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,649
and those were the most obvious one so

00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,179
we started there and so really it's just

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,610
a matter of taking those little snippets

00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,929
adding them to the to the blueprint and

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,299
then pushing the blueprint back into the

00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,709
server and running back command and that

00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,649
was how we built the thing that we just

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:04,559
built or just booted like that's all it

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:05,970
took so yeah there are like I was saying

00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,619
there are other ways you would you might

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,990
want to configure your systems other

00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:11,999
than installing rpm's creating users and

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,889
giving them keys and things like that

00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:15,240
there's all sorts of great tools there

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:16,740
so the kickstart gives you a lot of

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,829
options for you know turning surfaces on

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,529
and off and doing all sorts of things

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:24,809
and is magic and once you do pretty much

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,100
anything and then the a lot of

00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:29,100
environments use things like cloud in it

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,899
or ignition or what have you to when the

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,819
image boots up figure out where it is

00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:37,619
and configure itself accordingly we do

00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,800
not have we don't have a but there's

00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:40,570
some of these things that we can

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,519
surely do we want you used we want you

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,019
to use those tools to do that stuff

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,310
composer isn't going to handle

00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,200
everything that these things do because

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,209
those are great tools and we don't want

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,440
to reinvent them we wanted to give you

00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,899
the parts where you get to build the

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,220
image and then use the existing tools to

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,570
do what you need to do so we want to

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,339
know what sorts of things you're doing

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,320
with the systems once you've you know

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:05,920
other than put a bunch of RPMs together

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,240
add a user and go to town because we

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,220
don't know what everybody does with

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,490
their systems and we need to hear from

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,570
you

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:19,839
that's why do you have the survey and

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:27,269
that's what we're asking so so do we

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:31,990
have results yeah so should I just

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:34,420
reload it oh yeah by the way this is in

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,410
fedora or it's in a copper in Fedora 29

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:41,589
you can install it and play with it

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:45,750
right now it's also in rel numbers to

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:48,100
talk about real numbers it is okay

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,940
there's a number after seven we're

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,940
allowed to talk about that again

00:13:52,410 --> 00:14:01,779
but yes I'm told that this is available

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:07,750
for Pharrell and it's in fedora so just

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:11,860
the number two mean to people okay all

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:22,600
right so we had what like seven people

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:25,420
answer the survey so so it's hard to

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,600
compare other two ansible but two people

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:33,399
chose ansible over other i mean the

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,500
other ones does anyone want to talk

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,640
about ansible I don't know are there

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,380
things that we were missing that you're

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,699
like oh I can't believe you forgot my

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,380
favorite tool slash image slash whatever

00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:46,360
anybody want to talk about their stuff

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,870
or no

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:58,420
yeah chef chef I don't know anything

00:14:49,870 --> 00:15:01,089
about Chef will you use use chef in to

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:11,800
make images that's the thing it does me

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:13,510
you will do some research on that okay

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,459
yeah so it's if you're if you're

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,990
creating an image sort of while you're

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,339
creating the image you do some some

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,180
sheffy stuff in the image and then

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,820
you're done with it right so yeah we're

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,620
we're trying to work on sort of a mental

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,170
model of like you make an image and the

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,230
images is not mutable while it's being

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,519
built like an image you you say what you

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,529
want to what kind of an image you want

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,779
and the image appears the idea that like

00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:39,130
while it's being built you can kind of

00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,320
stick your hand in the machine and tweak

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,910
some things we would like it a lot

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,740
better if you did that afterward there's

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,089
some interesting technical reasons for

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,370
that if you want to come talk to me

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:50,050
about them I will talk your ear off you

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,760
probably don't want to hear about it but

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,589
there's some very good reasons why

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,589
that's a really good way to build images

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:05,860
all right everyone loves kickstart

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,690
hooray I love kickstart - can we get a

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,870
raise of hands like just from the whole

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,209
audience of like is kickstart your first

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:18,990
perform for Fred tooling could you raise

00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:28,720
your hand yeah okay all right

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:32,110
good to know right where the ansible

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,980
people on the audience yeah show me okay

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,750
cool thank you for showing love to the

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:46,329
Red Hat native products we love you go

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:47,829
hack all right cloud in it a little love

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:52,089
for cladding it I'm not gonna I'm not

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:55,120
green all right so yeah like I said you

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,640
can play with this now um so yeah I I

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,320
guess one of the things that we're going

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,750
to start looking at because we're

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,150
part of this was figuring out okay we

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,130
can build images and then what and so if

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,750
I'm understanding what we're getting

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,459
from the survey and you're raising your

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,079
hand we should start looking at the

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,300
things that are in kickstart files the

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,630
directives that are in there is it all

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,610
right

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,230
everybody who loads kick-starts are you

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,010
thinking about the like commands that

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,750
are in kick-starts or the post scripts

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,610
if you're like raise your hand if you're

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:32,020
like I need my posted scripts or else

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:33,790
this doesn't work for me okay but and

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,200
then everybody else is so pretty happy

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,910
with the way that you can configure the

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,540
images with this stuff that's just the

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,790
commands kickstart provides yeah can we

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,320
have it need if you if you look all

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,180
right cool everybody loves kickstart

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:52,180
everything is fine nothing is ruined I

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:55,240
told you guys this is yet so composers

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,730
is pretty new or it's not pretty new

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,170
it's it's a it's a new way of looking at

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,360
the old tools that we had and we're

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,370
trying to really do the best we can to

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,630
design something that really like works

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,130
for you and make your lot makes your

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,890
lives easier and better in whatever

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,260
small way we can so getting this sort of

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,220
information from you isn't just like

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,350
thanks for telling us we're great it's

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,370
we want to make this good for y'all so

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:21,520
that's why we're asking these weird

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:23,050
questions so thanks for indulging us if

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,800
you want to come talk more about it um

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:29,530
the code is the code for the cockpit

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,590
plug-in and back-end it's part of Lorax

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:35,110
and welder web that's email if you want

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,380
economy contact me directly yeah and

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,990
then a uxd booth is husband and that far

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,660
at the end of the hall that way so you

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,470
can come find me or Sarah who's also in

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,420
the audience and we would love to get

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,330
your feedback on different aspects of

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,300
this tool and so please come see us this

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,460
afternoon or tomorrow or Sunday will be

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,200
much appreciated thank you thanks very

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,670
much

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,670
[Applause]

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,100
doing a question yeah did anyone have a

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:13,830
question or things they wanted to tell

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:25,919
us we forgot about Josh two questions

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:27,059
alright I will so the question was when

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,900
we're talking about OS images are we

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,120
talking specifically about

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,650
virtualization images or also containers

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,150
and one of the output formats is tar

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,740
which was our sort of easiest way of

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,179
being like you could cram this into

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,000
docker if you wanted to

00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:42,960
we weren't focused on creating container

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,130
images in our first sort of evolution of

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
this we wanted to start with the things

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,690
that we knew at the time but yeah that's

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,340
that's a thing that we are thinking

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,409
about but not our main goal as I

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,710
understand it right now and second

00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,710
question

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,660
that's so the question was about whether

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,850
when you we want the images to be

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,470
immutable and if you build it one day

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,390
and then build it again six months later

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,340
are you gonna get the same content or

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,960
are you gonna get different content the

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,580
intent the way that we have structured

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,900
the the blueprint file it's supposed to

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,910
be the case that you'll get the same

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,520
thing if you build it again two months

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,560
later assuming that the content is still

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,580
there which is of course kind of tricky

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,020
because if you're building against

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,960
fedora you might have had an update

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,760
that's no longer there and that's part

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,350
of a larger problem with this sort of

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,120
ecosystem that we really all need to

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,630
have a long conversation about what the

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,270
intent is the blueprint once created is

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,800
like a static manifest of here's what I

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,090
wanted in this image don't change it

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,390
unless I say so that's why we're so

00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,850
careful about reviewing and committing

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,340
changes we wanted to be very carefully

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:06,160
changed does that answer the question

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,590
okay do you have a preference in that

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,840
workflow would you want it to remain the

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,830
same or do you want it to automatically

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,290
update as your contents yeah what's it

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,250
is the expectation if you if you built

00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,480
an image today and then you tried to

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,890
build it again six months later would

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,090
you expect that it would be built with

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,750
updates or would you expect it would

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,750
build the same thing

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,970
that's the intent is as you described

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,030
that we would we'd like it to be that

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,410
it's reliable that what we built is what

00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,970
you built is specifically going to be

00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,290
the same thing if you build it again you

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,940
know in a different form six months

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,200
later that will freeze the content and

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,960
build it again and it doesn't change

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,550
unless you want it to change which is

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,770
sort of a shift in thinking away from

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:15,820
the way that the ecosystem works right

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:17,500
now so it's a challenge yeah do you have

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,800
to have cockpit running no you can just

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:27,000
run the the cockpit or the the composer

00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,000
server and use the CLI yep yes

00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:00,039
okay yeah yeah the comment was for the

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,779
for the microphone the comment was that

00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,940
he would expect that um

00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,159
and I'm hoping I understand you so you'd

00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,120
expect that the there'd be a checkbox

00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,309
are something that would let you know

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,960
that either you can say I would like

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:13,519
this to update as time goes on or I

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,070
would like this to say it exactly the

00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,510
version I chose and both you need or

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,889
want both of those options to be

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,889
available to you in some form

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,800
yeah so you would want to know

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,290
specifically when you've created images

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:22,020
what version of the package was in each

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:24,690
image you've created okay thank you

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,460
that makes sense thanks yeah we have

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,240
time for one last question if there are

00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:33,440
if there is one last question t-money

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,440
got any burning questions

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,980
okay I'm gonna answer those backwards

00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,630
the the second question was is there any

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,910
plan to have it be able to upload the

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,030
images to you know wherever you need it

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,770
to go we're trying or at this point

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,169
that's out of scope for us because there

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,299
are so many places to put the images so

00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:21,500
we're trying not to get ahead of

00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:23,960
ourselves and do that there are other

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,470
tools to do the thanks and the first

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,840
question was rel entitlement things like

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:34,850
that how do you get that sort of stuff

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,320
and this was okay the real and I'm gonna

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:42,100
defer to somebody else on that one

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:49,309
because I I do not thank you

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:49,309
