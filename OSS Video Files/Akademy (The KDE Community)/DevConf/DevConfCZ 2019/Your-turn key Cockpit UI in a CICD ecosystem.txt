	Presentation name: Your-turn key Cockpit UI in a CICD ecosystem
Speaker: Martin Pitt
Description:  Cockpit (https://cockpit-project.org) and its builtin set of UIs for system 
services has become an integral part of Fedora Server, RHEL, and is included in
all major distributions.

It has always been very simple to create your own interfaces using Cockpit's
API. But it is a big step from some quick HMTL+JS proof of concept towards
maintaining a production-grade project with proper integration testing/gating
and fully automatic delivery. This talk introduces the tools and services that
the Cockpit team offers for developing your Cockpit extensions, which gets you
there right from scratch.
