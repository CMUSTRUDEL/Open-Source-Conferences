	Presentation name: How do we get from 1000s projects to one product
Speaker: Luděk Šmíd
Description:  RHEL is composed of 1000s of upstream projects. It's commonly known that Fedora is upstream of RHEL and yet - development of enterprise grade operating system brings its own challenges.

I will cover the challenges of putting together major version of RHEL as I have very close experience with development of major RHEL releases. I plan to cover some technical details and some high level lessons we've learned from 3+ years long projects.
