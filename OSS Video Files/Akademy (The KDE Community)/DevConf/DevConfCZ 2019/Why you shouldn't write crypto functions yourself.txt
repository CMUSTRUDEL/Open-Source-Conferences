	Presentation name: Why you shouldn't write crypto functions yourself
Speaker: Simo Sorce
Description:  Writing cryptographic functions is not hard, you do not even need to understand the math behind the cryptographic primitive you want to implement to be able to construct a set of cunctions that correctly encrypts and decrypts ciphertext.
So why cryptographers keep saying you should not implement your own crypto ?
In this talk we'll show practical examples that explain why implementing a mathematical function correctly is only the easy part of the job, and where the devil in the detail lies. We'll also show how even thought through implementations sometimes can be attacked, and how they evolve over time.

Genral understanding of how modern CPUs work is useful to better understand the more technical parts. Knowledge of a programming language is highly recommended.
