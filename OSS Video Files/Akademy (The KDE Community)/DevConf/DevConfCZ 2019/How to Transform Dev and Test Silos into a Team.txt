Description: 
	Presentation name: How to Transform Dev and Test Silos into a Team
Speaker: Stuart Corcoran
Description:  One of the foundations of lean/agile development is the elimination of waste, delay, and low customer satisfaction associated with siloed dev and test organizations. This talk describes how one software organization transformed siloed dev and test functions into unified teams focused on delivering value to customers. Attendees will learn:
-- why siloed teams are sub-optimal
-- how to plan for the transformation
-- the challenges to expect and how to overcome them
-- how the teams can evolve and grow
By presenting this information I hope to provide encouragement and a roadmap to teams facing the challenge of siloed dev and test teams, and call on them to start a transformation journey.
No limit on attendees.
