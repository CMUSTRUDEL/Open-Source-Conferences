Description: 
	Presentation name: Upstream kernel CI using patchew and TDC
Speaker: Davide Caratti
Description:  The Linux kernel provides TDC, a selftest suite for the TC subsystem. Unit tests are easy to write (a small example is presented), and the self-test suite can be enhanced with plugins to allow more coverage (e.g. valgrind or kmemleak). We show the setup of patchew (https://patchew.org) to monitor the kernel netdev mailing list and launch the TDC testsuite for each single patch targeting the TC subsystem. Developers/maintainers are then notified in case of functional breakage. Attendees will be encouraged to contribute to the Linux kernel testsuite, know more about patchew and also find a quick reference of usage for TC commands.
