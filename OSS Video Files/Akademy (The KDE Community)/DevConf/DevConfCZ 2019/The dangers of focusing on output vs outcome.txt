	Presentation name: The dangers of focusing on output vs outcome
Speaker: Jen Krieger
Description:  Have you heard these phrases at work in the past three months?
1. That's now how it works here. Or, that will never work here.
2. We can't move forward until we have a better solution designed.
3. We can't make a decision until we have everyone in the room.

The expectation to deliver high-quality, feature rich software faster while inadequately addressing the pressure of that has created an environment of high stress and low reward. Trying to change decades of ingrained habits comes at an understandable technology and human cost. 

In this talk, you will learn what behaviors are a result of cultures that put an emphasis on output vs. outcome, how you can mitigate them as technologists, and ultimately focus on achieving a healthy and empowered environment.
