	Presentation name: Using SELinux with container runtimes
Speakers: Lukas Vrabec, Daniel Walsh
Description:  This talk will explain how SELinux works with containers. We will show how to enable/disable SElinux using multiple different container runtimes and define the default types. The two default types for running containers are container_t which is a fully confined domain, which eliminates any use of the host files unless they are relabeled. Or spc_t, which is the type containers run with when SELinux is disabled for container separation, --privileged mode. Writing custom policy for each container that needed additional access would be very difficult and require a container policy writer. Lukas built a new standalone tool, udica for generating SELinux policy profiles for containers based on automatic inspecting these containers. Come to see how easy you can create own policy for container!
