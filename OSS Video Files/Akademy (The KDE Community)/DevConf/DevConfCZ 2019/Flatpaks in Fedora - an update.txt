	Presentation name: Flatpaks in Fedora - an update
Speaker: Owen Taylor
Description:  At DevConf.cz last year, Fedora's efforts to create Flatpaks in Fedora infrastructure out of Fedora Packages were presented. At that point, development was far along, but the capability was not yet deployed in Fedora infrastructure. A year later, Flatpaks are being built and are available for users to install.

This session will cover:

* What has changed in the last year?
* What progress has been made at creating a Fedora-based runtime and application Flatpaks?
* How do Fedora packagers and other interested get involved?
* How do users try out the Flatpaks?
* Automation and other things currently being worked on.
