Description: 
	Presentation name: Russian GOST cryptography in and near OpenSSL
Speaker: Belyavskiy Dmitry
Description:  There is a necessity to provide national cryptography in various applications. The presentation describes history, current state and future of Russian GOST support in OpenSSL and OpenSSL-based applications. 

Russian GOST support in OpenSSL is divided between modifications of OpenSSL itself and the engine (https://github.com/gost-engine/engine) implementing the low-level cryptographic primitives. The presentation describes the edge cases of using externally provided algorithms, problems of support of the national specifics in OpenSSL and adopting applications and standards to support national cryptography. 

The presentation contains history of the universal API for asymmetric cryptography in OpenSSL and provides some ideas about possible API development to make it more flexible.
