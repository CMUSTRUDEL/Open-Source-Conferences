	Presentation name: Postcopy live-migration with vhost user backend
Speaker: Maxime Coquelin
Description:  This talk will start with a presentation of most commonly used method for live-migrating VMs, also known as pre-copy live migration. Specifically, it will describes what is done in DPDK's vhost-user backend to support it and what limitations it brings in the scope of high-speed networking.
Then, another method whose goal is to address limitation seen, post-copy live-migration, will be presented. The addition of its support in DPDK's vhost-user backend will be described, and its possible limitations will be addressed.
Finally, the presenter will show some benchmarks comparing performance of the two solutions, to see if post-copy method keeps its promises in the scope of NFV.
