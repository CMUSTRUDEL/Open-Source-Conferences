	Presentation name: Tuned - helper for system tuning
Speaker: Jaroslav Å karvada
Description:  The talk will introduce Tuned and its features. Tuned is application for system tuning. It can help system administrators to optimize their systems for various workloads (e.g. SAP, Oracle DB, MS SQL, ...) or to optimize systems for general goals like high throughput, low latency, or low power consumption. Instead of having configuration on multiple places and in custom scripts, Tuned stores all its configuration cleanly in one place - in the Tuned profile. It can do do rollback of settings, supports hot plugging of devices and can be controlled from the command line or through the D-Bus, thus it can be easily integrated into existing administering solutions like e.g. Cockpit.
