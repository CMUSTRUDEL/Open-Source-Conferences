	Presentation name: Developing RHEL open source way
Speaker: Luděk Šmíd
Description:  Program and project management of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is daunting task which provides tons of learning opportunities. RHEL is unique because we use Open Source as the way how to develop and maintain it.

I work for more than 10 years in program management team responsible for planning and delivering RHEL releases. I would like to share what the team learned what worked and what did not work as the product was getting more complex over time.
