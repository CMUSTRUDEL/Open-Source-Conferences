Description: 
	Presentation name: System - wide crypto policies what and why
Speaker: Tomáš Mráz
Description:  System-wide crypto policies are a fairly new thing in Fedora. In this talk I will introduce them and show the reasons why system-wide crypto policies are needed.
Then we look at them in more details - which are the currently provided policy levels, which core crypto components follow the policy, and how the policies are implemented.
I will also provide overview of what is in works and what are the future plans with the system-wide crypto policies features.
The attendants of the talk should have some basic knowledge of cryptography algorithms and secure protocols from the user's point of view.
