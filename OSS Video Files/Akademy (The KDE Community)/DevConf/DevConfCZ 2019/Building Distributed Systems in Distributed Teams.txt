	Presentation name: Building Distributed Systems in Distributed Teams
Speaker: Philipp Krenn
Description:  Building distributed systems is notoriously hard... building a distributed team, even more so. At Elastic — the company behind the open source tools Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash — everything is distributed; the company and our products. This talk dives into the details of how Elastic is thriving on its distributed model:

* How Elastic started to be distributed by design.
* What our shared values are and what we have learned as we progressed and grew to our current size.
* What the day of an Elastician can look like.
* What we are using in terms of tooling.
* How we hire and onboard new employees.
