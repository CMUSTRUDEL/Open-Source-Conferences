and so I'd like the way we have two

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,220
fantastic slow birdies here from Red Hat

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:22,199
three being and might be the we'd like

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,720
to welcome you to beards and they have

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,369
two fabulous faces of hair like I mean

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,529
it is wonderful and before we get into

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:33,090
talking about continuous improvement

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:37,140
let's find out a bit about each of them

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,480
so first thanks Ralph I know that you

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,320
normally shave your beard off at around

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,390
this time of year and I'm so thankful

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,610
that you've kept it for this event so

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,350
but why do you shave it off in the

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,890
middle of winter instead of summer that

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,380
seems crazy that's kind of personal

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,850
you know you know I actually stopped I

00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:03,480
decided to stop doing that you kept

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,330
right now and do you hate dogs

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,849
oh well that's what's going around Mike

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,550
B I heard you are an interesting scuba

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:33,380
you have scuba stuff yeah and do you

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:37,430
keep your snorkel in your beard okay and

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,420
what's your favorite fish I guess it

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,310
would probably have to be the

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:47,780
humuhumunukunukuapua'a because it's fun

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:48,980
to say wow I didn't expect that to

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,080
business down to business

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,590
okay let's you guys are both part of the

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,209
amazing factory 2.0 team which despite

00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,410
your involvement has become highly

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:03,260
functional and they work with consistent

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,150
goals of self-improvement and Mike can

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,400
you give us a rundown of the history of

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,489
factory 200 and the products you've

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,340
created

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,970
yeah the factory factory 2 initiative

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,230
started way back in the day from

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,609
conversation with some executives and

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,560
they said we don't like the way the

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:24,109
pipeline works so we want you to fix it

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,019
it was literally the only the only

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,370
instructions that I got so we started

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,030
trying to figure out what the problems

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,500
actually were actually did a survey of

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:38,239
stakeholders Rafa was involved in that

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,370
we took those survey results had them

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,370
vote on the highest priority ones we got

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,319
a list of about seven priorities out of

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:52,910
that and then just decided to figure out

00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:54,769
how to start addressing them so the

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,010
basic concept is improving the product

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,420
pipeline we have you heard a lot of a

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,400
lot this weekend probably about like

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,319
models like monolithic applications that

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,359
people are dealing with so we were no

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,650
different the applications that have

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,040
developed over the course of a decade or

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,840
more

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,900
so we breaking those down into micro

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,569
services applying some modern

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,459
development and deployment processes to

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,200
the services in the pipeline and using

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,690
that to accelerate delivery of new

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,450
features and enabling us to innovate

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,300
more in response to the business

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,740
and when are actually what are all the

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:36,260
products that we now have I have a

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:38,450
t-shirt with a bunch of them but oxn so

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,060
results DB is very much as it sounds

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,680
it's a database to store test results

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,580
and centralize them provide an API to

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,130
query them freshmaker is a service which

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,060
allows you which responds to events from

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:54,320
other services and triggers other events

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,470
so we use that for automating things

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,790
like rebuilds Greenwave is a policy

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,620
engine in fact it was originally named

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,070
policy and gen until we got told that

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,500
wasn't interesting enough and it tells

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,480
you when a set of criteria for releasing

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,130
something has been met and then on

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,020
demand compose service also somewhat

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:17,360
self-explanatory but it runs composes on

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,610
demand ok I'll have to go back to my

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,420
screen soon ok

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,980
so cool and Sophie's Choice Ralph if you

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,020
can only save one product of all the

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,530
products that the team is made which one

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:35,690
are you gonna change I can't I can't

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:37,610
answer that I can have it's green wave I

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:43,040
guess ok

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,590
and you I'll say yourself see because

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,640
it's like the beginning of started with

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,640
ok I might have to log back in

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,579
[Music]

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:16,210
okay surprisingly some people actually

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,210
use your products and so here's a slide

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,229
of people saying wonderful things about

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,050
them and I just want I don't know if

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,889
Josh is here but Josh doesn't look like

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,229
that at all

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:31,610
I think that's his tinder picture I mean

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:36,830
where do these people get these pictures

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:38,870
okay now we're going to talk about next

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:44,029
is actually about continuous improvement

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,370
and what we did with our team so first

00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,259
of all to get your team to have a

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,879
continuous improvement mindset they have

00:06:48,259 --> 00:07:02,270
to be a team and so Mike how did team

00:06:52,879 --> 00:07:05,300
start though so the team really just

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,789
started with me and Ralph and we we came

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,379
with a plan and proposed that two

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,279
stakeholders and they agreed and then we

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:14,089
said okay we're gonna need some people

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,699
so we just started borrowing people from

00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,229
other parts of the organization and we

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,169
got some people from DevOps who were

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,389
involved and it said you know explain

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,639
the the concept and the approach that we

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,919
were taking to them and in launch some

00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,029
some new projects actually I should step

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,120
back a little bit the first thing we

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,919
said was well what can we repurpose that

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,629
already exists to help us achieve our

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,860
goals and so one of the first steps was

00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:39,800
bringing in some of the pieces that art

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,089
existed in fedora like results DB that

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,439
was a component that had had already

00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:44,689
been used in fedora as part of the task

00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,639
patron project and we redeployed it

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,580
internally and said this was going to be

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,589
how we're aggregating test content so

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,839
how do we like move on from there and

00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,400
build on that and then figured out some

00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,009
some new services that we needed to

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:05,900
develop started a design process and

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:07,339
continued from there cool and when I

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,379
entered the team you guys were

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,689
developing using scrum and then we

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:14,349
quickly moved to

00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:17,069
doing Kanban and I said some stuff all

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:20,589
the time and do you guys repeat after me

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:23,110
same sized work if you're doing Kanban

00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:27,189
everything has to be the same size or

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,829
else you'll fail and so but in order for

00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,449
our team to be thinking about continuous

00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:34,000
improvement we took some steps to make

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:36,969
them feel like they were a team so we

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,370
worked on and we had goals of having

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,009
them feel connected we had a goal of

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,589
having it being fun to be on our team

00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:46,839
and we had a goal of them being

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,759
technically challenged on our team okay

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:52,949
so Mike do you want to talk about some

00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:55,750
strategies we use to help people connect

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,100
you know we were always a distributed

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,300
team it was sort of the nature of you

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,250
finding resources where they were

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:05,199
available and so we would we had video

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,720
conferences as most distributed teams do

00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:10,930
we encourage people to you know actually

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,459
be present turn on their cameras we

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,500
would do various things to make sure

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:16,059
that people understood what we were

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,579
trying to accomplish and what value we

00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,569
were bringing as part of our efforts I

00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,309
think it's really important so that

00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:25,389
people feel the value of the work that

00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:27,819
they're doing and then yeah we made sure

00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:31,149
that they the team understood who the

00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:33,490
stakeholders were what they were trying

00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,410
to a tree achieve with in with every

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,809
sprint and then we had longer-term

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,180
quarterly milestones about actually

00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:46,839
delivering their you oh sorry

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:48,819
okay yes we would we would go back and

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,500
forth between different time zones that

00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,839
was another challenge with distributed

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:58,720
teams is that we had people in in

00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:00,069
Australia coast of the US so time zones

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,620
were a challenge and so we try to spread

00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:05,889
the pain out and switch when we did

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:12,129
retros everybody could be inconvenience

00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:14,670
equally yeah we did face faces whenever

00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:17,470
budget allowed we did a big one are

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,759
associated with flock when it was in

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,869
Hyannis Massachusetts um you may have

00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,279
been

00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,019
and that was really great it's really

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,899
valuable even though you might see

00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,369
people on a stand up or a retro every

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,139
you know every few days every week

00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:31,239
getting people together in a room and

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,349
being able to talk and have really high

00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:35,229
bandwidth conversations was very

00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:39,999
valuable Thanks

00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:43,389
and and then Ralph although you are fun

00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,029
challenged you wanted the team to have

00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,219
fun at work so what are some of those

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,139
things that we tried out to make that

00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:52,119
happen

00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:55,349
I'm not not fun challenged in general

00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:58,599
it's just mandatory organized fun that a

00:10:55,349 --> 00:11:01,029
little resistant to but we did do some

00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:03,159
some cool things one of them was we had

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:04,629
a we had like a funny hats challenge

00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,859
week so like stand-up was getting a

00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:07,839
little dry we were doing the same things

00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:09,999
over again so we said wear a funny hat

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,169
to stand up but on a surprise day and so

00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:13,299
people would start staying up with their

00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,319
you know turn the cameras on and we have

00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,419
a good chuckle at the beginning of

00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,969
stand-up I think you won that Neil yeah

00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:21,699
it's tremendous hat covered in owls it

00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:24,339
was like a dr. Seuss head

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,529
we did a another thing where we did a

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,549
team team trivia you know we work a lot

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,959
with each other and we understand each

00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:31,419
other there's technical preferences and

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,279
what we're focused on but we would we

00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,199
had a people submit questions and

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,209
answers about themselves and then

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,589
assembled it's big maybe 20 question

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,269
surveyed and we put around the team you

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:41,679
know who's the member of the team that

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,079
has this one attribute or another and

00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,699
and then we reviewed them in our retro

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,109
we just basically scrapped retro for the

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:49,239
whole the whole sprint that week and

00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,439
then just like one by one systematically

00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,449
unveiled the answers with people

00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,769
guessing and betting on who was who was

00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:54,909
who in the team it was cool we got to

00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:59,259
you know learn things about each other

00:11:54,909 --> 00:12:01,269
and get that background so yeah I think

00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:07,809
Mike you had shoes that melted in a

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:09,759
volcano was that right and Mike you like

00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:13,959
to be challenged yourself technically by

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,879
waking up and turning a computer on but

00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:18,189
in terms of people that actually do work

00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:24,309
on the team how do you keep them

00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:27,669
challenged so we have a lot of different

00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:30,849
areas of work that we were involved in

00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:32,559
so we would trail could just ask people

00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,749
like what is

00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,979
which one of these services are you do

00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,419
you know the most about which do you

00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:40,359
know the least about what are you most

00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,679
interested in learning more about so

00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,329
just being engaged with a team and

00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,660
understanding what their interests are

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:47,799
and where they feel like they could grow

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,289
we also create it very reasonably

00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,179
actually created a apprenticeship

00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:53,589
program so that people who were more

00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,589
familiar with the codebase couldn't

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,319
mentor people on a who are less familiar

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,999
with it bring them up to speed which was

00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,679
great for not only reducing the bus

00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,989
factor but also getting people involved

00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,579
in encode bases that they weren't

00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:09,009
familiar with and spreading the

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,589
expertise across across the entire team

00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,419
so not getting not having people be

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,929
siloed in one code base or one

00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:18,639
particular area of the pipeline

00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:20,769
yeah that's a pretty cool program we had

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,019
and we started it with a survey so that

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,209
people volunteered for getting into

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:31,109
products that they weren't able to get

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:34,660
into and we had and so we had people

00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:37,149
volunteer and it seems again it

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,029
challenges them technically we also do

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,649
surveys quarterly to see if people are

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,329
satisfied with the work they're doing to

00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:44,919
make sure that they still want to be

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:50,559
part of the team right because we don't

00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:52,239
want them to be leaving okay so we

00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,789
worked on becoming a team that was

00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:56,259
that's really important and the next

00:13:54,789 --> 00:14:00,609
thing we worked on was what is our

00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:03,509
vision so so you can't get somewhere if

00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:08,259
you don't know where you want to go and

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:10,350
Mike Pete you were responsible for

00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:12,789
coming up with some of our vision our

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,759
secret vision of having three cats live

00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:21,429
in your beard has worked out but when is

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:23,109
the factory vision I touched on it a

00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:27,039
little bit earlier but the the overall

00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:30,549
vision is really to to move what had

00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,919
been a pretty legacy style pipeline into

00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:35,109
a dental more modern best practices of

00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,629
software engineering deployment so you

00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:39,789
know using micro services moving toward

00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:41,379
continuous deployment continuous

00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:44,169
integration across all of our services

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,720
and using that as an enabler to be more

00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,970
more

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,009
active responsive to the constantly

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:54,829
changing needs of the stakeholders and

00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:57,620
the business and so we have this overall

00:14:54,829 --> 00:15:01,009
vision of how factory 2.0 is going to

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:04,189
transform our pipeline and then we also

00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:06,319
have something we call okay ours or on

00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:10,819
our team we call them original crazy

00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:14,779
raps and so Ralph you what were some

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:16,009
good or bad raps that we've used you

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:20,870
might really want to tell what people

00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:22,850
what they are okay are the objectives

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,560
and key results and so this was a way

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,230
that we ended up trying to keep the team

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,639
focused and and have a direction and

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,990
have something that was also measurable

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,790
and we would know whether or not we were

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,170
making progress towards it and so in the

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,579
in the beginning it didn't didn't really

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,740
work out well we took what were our

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,209
epics in JIRA the major chunks of work

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,519
that we were working on and so one of

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:42,079
the tools we were others on the shirt is

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,939
freshmaker and we had a big freshmaker

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,069
epic in the beginning but the thing is

00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,569
is as work continued and as we got new

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,370
information new feature requests coming

00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:50,660
and that epic just continued to grow and

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,550
grow and grow and there was no point

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,899
when it would ever be done so that was

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,040
about the point in time when we stopped

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,779
and said we need something that is

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,509
measurable and that's gonna have gonna

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,670
have an end and so we we established

00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,589
some okay ARS like we need this feature

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,629
set to be livered by it to be delivered

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,250
by this point in time but it ended up

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,480
being like like abstract and

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,829
disconnected from what the team was

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,420
doing and things really transformed when

00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,430
we took the okrs from just like a kind

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,930
of project management level and brought

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,819
it down into the team and I started

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,129
assessing on a week-to-week basis and

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:21,079
stand up like how are we moving towards

00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,670
this particular goal at times less than

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,870
just focusing on all the new cards that

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,000
are coming in and all the new cards that

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,800
were that we're working on we ended up

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,420
doing some some process improvement okay

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,829
ours there in the mix - so like summer

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,509
feature driven we want to be able to we

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,339
want people who use the pipeline to be

00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,660
able to do this new thing and then other

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,370
okay ours would be like we want to

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,959
change the amount of time that it takes

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,569
us to get through code reviews to reduce

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,550
that by I will say 10% in this quarter

00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:45,050
over the the previous quarter and those

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,699
two when we would just keep them at a

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,259
tracking level and we weren't talking

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:49,759
about them and the team proved to be of

00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,079
no value but it's only when you bring

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,850
them in and work with the team to talk

00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,290
about them on a regular basis that they

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,550
they tend to have that that feedback

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,470
loop

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,920
yeah and I think this is a bit of the

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,770
secret sauce for how the team has helped

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:09,490
keep the vision keep focused and work on

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:12,490
things was how they tie every quarter

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,439
the work that they're doing to something

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,160
and change it and work together on what

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,870
that is

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:23,010
and when you when you pull work you know

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,030
that it comes from like it's attached to

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:30,100
the epic that you're supposed to be

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,450
working on sort of thing right and okay

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,210
we only have five minutes left

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,520
so Mike you're going to talk about how

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:43,690
we use how okay ours although help

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:45,760
prioritize the backlog though sure so we

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,580
when we started thinking about okay ours

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,610
we really wanted to make sure that we

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,720
were tracking things that were visible

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,360
to customers so that we're actually

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,220
making a measurable impact to the people

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,550
that were using the the pipeline so you

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,000
know internal engineering qe people that

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,160
engage with a pipeline so we that would

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,930
help us you know focus on what was what

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,000
were the important things that we had to

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,700
work on right we like every team here we

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,970
have a ridiculous amount of requests

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,620
that come in from from all sources even

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,470
things that we want to fix you know

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,930
technical debt bugs with the services

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,280
request for new features and you know

00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,750
that all gets into a if that's all just

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,010
piled up in a backlog it can be pretty

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,670
daunting to figure out what you should

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,990
actually be working on next so when in

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,020
the context of okay ours we were able to

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,420
think about what are the those things in

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,950
backlog that are actually the most the

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,560
most painful or like the most pressing

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,360
for our customers in our stakeholders

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,340
and then organize those into larger

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,710
pieces of work that we could then

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,440
address over the course of you know a

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,510
month or a quarter and deliver and show

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,580
real value to the to the stakeholders

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:59,410
that was helpful yeah again I think one

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:04,070
of the big secret sauces and so we have

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:06,500
a team feel like a team we have

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,690
you know set up some crazy raps and now

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,820
we are doing some experiments and seeing

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,670
if they're working and especially with

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:18,200
process changes so we were doing Canon

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:21,860
BAM and we analyze our flow and we

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,330
monitor our cue sizes our whip and our

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,830
throughput and in cycle times if you

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,660
want to find out what those things are

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,630
and what those mean talk to me

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,570
afterwards but basically it allows us to

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,910
see our work and we really watch where

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,530
our inventory builds up and look for

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,310
where we were having problems where

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,960
that's happening and we had a great

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:44,450
thing where we're watching this so Ralph

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,550
if you want to talk about the deployment

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:51,170
whip breakage and then what we did about

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:52,610
that yeah yeah so so as a development

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,170
team primarily a development team we

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,550
have some tickets and when you work on a

00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,740
ticket it moves through various phases

00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,390
you go to in progress you do some code

00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,400
review and as a development team after

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,320
code review you're done right you close

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,240
the ticket because it's done but for us

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,560
as a DevOps team that's not true it

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,630
actually has to make it into production

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,980
and for our team in particular it's even

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,510
a little bit more complicated because we

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,130
were developing services that we wanted

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,770
to deploy to the Fedora production

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,690
environment for fedoras use cases and

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,700
also to the internal production

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,680
environment to produce to produce Red

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,150
Hat products and so it ended up being

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,560
this sizeable chunk of work for us

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,820
deployment has always worked but for us

00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,770
it was double cuz we had to do it twice

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,910
and it was this hidden work

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,050
we were thinking we're working on these

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,430
cards why aren't we making any progress

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,960
on our development cards all is because

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,940
everybody is drowning in deployment

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,460
times so we changed the way we did

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,050
Kanban and added new columns on the side

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,700
for that a card isn't actually done

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,680
until it's deployed in production in

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,540
both circumstances and what we knew to

00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,680
be true already kind of intuitively that

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,140
we have a whole bunch of deployment

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,820
stuff going on we could see visibly on

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,170
our board so when we get to stand up and

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,180
there's some cards in progress and

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,460
there's like 25 cards depending

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,020
deployment we're like why spend any more

00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,370
time adding new cards through code

00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,540
review and getting them into the queue

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,400
and we just need to get this stuff

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,070
deployed to get it out and making that

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,480
work visible as a part of the tool that

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,750
the team used to talk about their work

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,010
every day was was was key if just you or

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,100
I was monitoring it it wouldn't make a

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,220
difference yeah and and we we definitely

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,830
saw an improvement

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,429
I think 20 days to get stuff to deploy

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:23,429
to about 10 days or less now right

00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:26,190
Oh five days now Wow amazing

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:28,799
so that's it I don't know if we had we

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,799
might have time for a question but we

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,139
have one minute left so thanks everybody

00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,779
for coming and thanks for the beards for

00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,440
putting up with my jokes and I hope you

00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:46,340
had a good time

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:46,340
