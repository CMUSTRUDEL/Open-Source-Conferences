Publication date: 2016-02-12
Playlist: Community
Description: 
	Building a successful open source project is about more than code - and some of the best practices are either non-obvious, hard to get right, or often ignored by folks who focus 100% on code.

In this session, we'll talk about things you can do to build community and attract more users - which in turn, will attract more developers, and make life easier (long-term) and help ensure a long life for your project.

We'll cover everything from governance to social media, marketing, and documentation.
