	Speaker: Daniel Oh

This workshop is designed to be hands-on experiences on how to refactor existing Spring Boot apps(i.e. Petclinic) to Kubernetes-Native apps on Quarkus for Java developers. The workshop covers Spring Web, DI, Data, JPA, and Cache refactoring practices. Lab participants donâ€™t need to install any tools & software ahead of time. Instead, they will use CodeReady Workspaces(Web IDE), Spring & Quarkus runtimes, and OpenShift(Kubernetes) 4 for a deployment infrastructure.
