This is a hands-on workshop that will introduce Fedora CoreOS (an emerging Fedora Edition) and explain the differences between Fedora CoreOS and traditional Linux operating system distributions. In this lab you'll become familiar with the components of Fedora CoreOS and also the value this automatically updating container focused OS provides. By the end you'll be ready to deploy Fedora CoreOS in your infrastructure and contribute back to the growing Fedora CoreOS community.

We will be covering the following key topics in the hands-on portion of the workshop:

Key Topics:

- Provisioning with Ignition
- Using the Fedora CoreOS Config Transpiler
- Booting Fedora CoreOS for the first time
- Booting on a Cloud (AWS)
- Running provisioning scripts and containers on boot
- Understanding how updates work
- Performing rollback when needed

In order to perform this lab at home the user will need:

- An internet connection capable of downloading large files
- A Linux system with KVM support and libvirt installed and running
- The system must be able to start the VM with at least 2GiB of RAM and 10GiB of disk space and a few VCPUs

Participants will be provided AWS credits to follow the lab with the Cloud demo.
