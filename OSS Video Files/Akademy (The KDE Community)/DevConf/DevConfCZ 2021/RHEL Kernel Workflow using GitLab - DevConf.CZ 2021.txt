Publication date: 2021-03-19
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speakers: Prarit Bhargava, Don Zickus

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernel has modernized its workflow using GitLab as its source forge. With the release of CentOS-Stream, most of this workflow will be made public. This talk will discuss how the team uses gitlab to manage its Enterprise workflow requirements. We will introduce the CI pieces using the Continuous Kernel Integration (CKI) Service, the cli tools we use, lab and bichon, and the challenges we are working on overcoming. In addition, there will be examples of how non-Red Hat developers will be able to contribute to this workflow. Attendees should understand how git and git forges like GitLab work and the basic idea of CI services. Understanding how kernel development works is helpful but not necessary. An attendee will walk away understanding how to apply this workflow to their projects and how to contribute to the RHEL kernel.
