Title: From Jenkins-under-your-desk to resilient service - DevConf.CZ 2021

	Speakers: Michael Hofmann, Inaki Malerba


Red Hat's CKI ("cookie") project started out as a Jenkins proof-of-concept to show that kernel testing can be integrated into the kernel workflow.

Today, CKI provides all the infrastructure that stands between a merge request for a Fedora/CentOS/RHEL kernel repository on gitlab.com and the green check mark that signals that it can be merged.

Join us in our journey of how a bunch of engineers (that couldn't spell DevOps correctly) learned to operate a fast-moving resilient service used by kernel developers in their daily work.

We will talk about:

How we keep the CKI service up and running by
- using a state-of-the art logging, monitoring and alerting setup
- being persistent in the case of transient failures
- reducing single-point-of-failure

How we make it easy to modify the testing pipeline by
- running canary pipelines for unmerged code

How we make it safe to hack on the underlying infrastructure by
- dividing the backend infrastructure into microservices
- automatically deploying testing versions for merge requests
- automating production deployments
