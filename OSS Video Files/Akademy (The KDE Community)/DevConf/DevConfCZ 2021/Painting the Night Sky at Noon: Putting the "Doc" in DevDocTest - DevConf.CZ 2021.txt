DevDocTest is the agile practice of creating code synchronously with the user documentation of the code, and handing over both to be tested together. This is an excellent theoretical concept, with many benefits for everyone involved. It makes the development more focused, the testing easier, the documentation more accurate, and more. However, putting all this into practice can be rather tricky, and especially in larger teams, escaping the traditional waterfall workflow requires a lot of effort, and faces many pitfalls.

This talk will briefly introduce the basics of DevDocTest, and then recount a tech writer's experience with creating user documentation in lock-step with development and testers. It will include practical tips of what worked, what turned out to be not such a good idea, and how the overall experience differed from the waterfall approach.

The ultimate aim is for the audience - and especially the documentation writers among them - to learn whether DevDocTest is a viable workflow model for their teams, and if so, then how best to go about making it a reality.
