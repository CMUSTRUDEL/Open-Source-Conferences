Title: Leading and Growing an Open Source Comunity - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-17
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: Sayak Sakar



This presentation targets an audience of advanced practitioners - learners who are already contributing to an open-source community in a leadership position and want to be able to lead and grow the community more effectively.

These learners may be asking questions like:
- Why do people choose to lead open source projects and communities?
- What's the difference between participating in and leading a project?
- How can I ensure a community grows sustainably?
- How can I spread the word about this project or community?
- What type of a leadership structure does a community require?

This presentation is best for audiences who want to develop a "long-term vision" for their open source community but might not know how to begin. At the conclusion of this experience, participants will be able to:
- Describe key differences between community participation and community leadership
- Recognize challenges that new community leaders can face
- Identify strategies for both increasing and sustaining community participation
- Understand how to measure the success of community involvement and how to communicate that success to others

uh so hey everyone um

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,480
i'm sad it's great to be here and i work

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,960
as a senior software engineer at red hat

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
um today i'm going to be talking about

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,679
leading and

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,640
growing an open source community so let

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,640
me go to the next slide

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,680
yeah so uh let's talk about what open

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,240
source is and what

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,519
does community leadership mean so as

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,760
contributors to

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,200
a project become more familiar with how

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
the project works they may

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
wish to become more active in helping

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
the project grow

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,960
ultimately this means they will be

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,559
taking on more responsibilities

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,800
in the project so today we are doing uh

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,160
going to discuss in more detail what

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
this means what it means

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
uh that is to lead an open source

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
project and

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,680
a community uh the fact is that

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
contributing to an open source project

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,199
and needing that project up to

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
completely different modes of engaging

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,479
with that project

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,479
so let me try to explain why um

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
yeah um so as a contributor to an open

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
source

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
project your duties to the project may

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,920
be more or less straightforward

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
fix bugs answer questions in the

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720
project's channel

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,720
etc um when assuming a position of

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,720
leadership in the project your real role

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,079
becomes more comprehensive

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,840
you may have to drive technical

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,880
direction begin speaking with the

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
authority

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,479
for the project in public venues such as

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
conferences

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
initiate programs to recruit more

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
project members or

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
change the project's processes and

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
policies so in short

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
you are now assuming increased

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,240
responsibility for a project

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
uh success or failure um yeah next slide

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
please

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,719
so why why do we want to do that why

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
do we want to take on responsibility for

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
project and

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,119
community success uh there are many

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,200
reasons to take on a leadership position

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,720
in your favorite open source project uh

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,640
it may range from

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
the needs of your employers to the to

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
your own personal joy

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
as we consider taking on a leadership

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
position in the project

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
you might want to take some time to

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
think through your motivations for doing

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
so

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,640
having a good understanding of uh why

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,599
you want to lead will help you choose

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
the best places

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,519
for you to apply those skills and

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,480
interests in the project

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,239
uh it might be a conflict resolution or

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,160
better issue triaging processes

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
to make sure that uh the users are

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,560
getting more help quickly

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,319
and it's no secret that an in that

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
leading and open source project has many

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,160
tangible benefits when it comes to

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
seeking employment

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,239
but also many individuals choose a

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
leadership position for the simple

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
reason that they appreciate

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
their social connections in the process

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
community and wish to be of greater

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
service

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,599
to others in this community so if you

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,440
move to this next slide

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,560
we will explore some of the

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,159
in the goals for today uh so we would be

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,720
talking about the responsibilities

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,080
leaders have the transition pathway from

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,319
contributor to leader

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
and some ways in which excellent leaders

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
help their projects

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
avoid common social challenges so our

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,280
goals for today

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
include understanding common challenges

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
associated with expanding maintaining

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,159
and popularizing an open source project

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,760
exploring steps how new community

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,000
leaders can begin to address

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
those challenges and identify steps

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
where leaders can

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,040
take to achieve project success

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,599
so an additional note over here would be

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,519
that i

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
personally can't see that you will leave

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
our time together equipped

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,400
with everything uh that you could

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
possibly

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
know about being a project or community

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
leader

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,080
uh every project is different and i

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,959
don't know every bit of advice that can

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
help you lead

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,560
each of these different individual

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
projects so you will need to translate

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,200
this advice into your own context

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,040
what we are going to do today is examine

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,680
the most common avenues for

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,400
meeting uh the challenges new leaders

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,239
face

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,840
general pathways for getting started

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,680
that we have found

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,960
to be the most fruitful across

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,560
communities

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,160
um so moving on to the next slide

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,160
we would be i will begin by stressing

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
and that anyone interested in assuming a

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
leadership role in a community

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,560
driven uh project will need to begin by

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,680
asking three fundamental questions about

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
that project

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,919
uh these are how can you expand the

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
project

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,360
uh add control that is add contributors

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
and

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
increase participation in the project

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,840
how can you maintain the project that is

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,199
ensure that your project

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,639
is sustainable and that the project

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,800
stays on course

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,800
on pursuit of its mission innovation and

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
how can you popularize the project uh

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,440
that is increase its visibility

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,039
make it an appealing destination for

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,840
users and contributors

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,039
and keep it relevant in an ever growing

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
ecosystem

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
uh for the remainder of our session

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
today we will focus on each of these

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,960
three questions

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,320
uh so

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,520
the first uh thing that we will be uh

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
the first question that we will be

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,960
talking about is

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:33,039
the so next can you like

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,800
move to yeah

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,800
can you just move to slide 11

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,320
all right thank you uh

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,919
so let's begin with the challenge of

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
expanding the community

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,919
like how do you increase community

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,479
participation and contribution

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,720
um on the next slide

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,479
yeah so we we would be talking about two

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
types of challenges here uh one is

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,759
community challenges and the other one

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,039
is technical challenges

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,039
so uh on community challenges include

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,120
things like undocumented or

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,319
insider information or what we call

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,080
focusing

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,880
uh this talks about excessive and

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
undocumented insider information of hope

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,240
system which makes

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,080
newcomers uh not have enough context and

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,960
lacking that context makes them feel

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,520
excluded uh then there is the issue of

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,560
unwelcome social dynamics how how

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
welcome do you

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
feel uh when you join the community

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
especially how welcome to new

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
contributors feel when they join to the

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,960
youngest community perhaps

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,919
uh the project is not as inclusive as it

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,600
would be

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,440
uh undifferentiated contributor base

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
communities lacking a diverse

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,759
contributor base may not

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
seem welcoming to newcomers especially

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,160
those from underrepresented groups

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,080
this means diversity along all access

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,440
things like types of self skill set

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
vendor diversity

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
number of industries represented gender

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
diversity racial diversity

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
geographic diversity and the list can go

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,120
on

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,560
so when working to growing to grow your

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
community if it appears that the

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,479
community is only comprised of

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,880
one type of contributor people who are

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,240
not like the existing contributor base

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,280
may not feel very comfortable joining

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,759
um and the most obvious challenge again

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,840
is language various communities that

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,840
communicate in only one language can be

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
intimidating for those who don't speak

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,720
that language

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,720
moving to the next slide

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,400
we talk about the technical challenges

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,759
so this includes lack of clear

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
onboarding and getting started

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
documentation

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
lack of hearing documentation on ways to

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,160
get started can

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,000
deter newcomers aligning contributors

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
with project needs aligning contributors

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
with different skills to the most

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,160
appropriate domains

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,919
inside the project can be challenging uh

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
finding contributors with specific

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,599
domain knowledge can be another

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
challenging part like how do you find

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,520
additional contributors with

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
specific domain knowledge of very

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,960
specialized use cases

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
uh that might be really difficult at

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,919
times uh

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,160
a project's code base may be directed at

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,360
a specialized use cases the project

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
might be relatively

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
niche so locating additional

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,919
contributors who share its

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,120
typical use cases might be really really

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,759
difficult

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
um then again there is unintended use

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
cases

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,880
uh which users might be applying a

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,399
project software

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,399
to situations where the project's

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,880
founders have never thought about

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,039
so the founders might themselves be

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,240
limiting their outreach

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,360
um so let's move on

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
uh to talk about uh contributor pathways

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,880
so every

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,160
project and community will need to

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
address these challenges

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,120
in ways that are most effective for them

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
however in general research is beginning

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
uh to address this uh challenges by

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,920
examining your project's contributor

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,760
pathways

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,440
so in the next slide uh we will talk

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,480
about what these

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
are so opportunities for new volunteers

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,120
uh

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
usually begin to lending their unique

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
talents to an

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,160
open source project are called uh

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
pro projects or contributor passes so to

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,880
greater the number of

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,880
contributor passwords that your project

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,560
features the more likely it is to

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,040
recruit participants with

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
various skills uh required for project

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,440
success

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
so when you are thinking of ways to

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
expand your project focusing on

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
contributor pathways is a great place to

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
begin

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,399
with uh so in the next slide

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
uh let's look at uh take a look at some

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,880
common contributor pathways

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
so firstly here are some for pathways

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
with community focus

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,760
uh things like documenting software

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,680
processes

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,200
onboarding and mentoring new members

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,160
localizing content into various

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
languages

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,320
copywriting managing social media

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,640
organizing events

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,720
so does your project currently offer new

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
and existing contributors opportunities

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,240
to

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,959
contribute rewardingly or even take

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,079
ownership of work in each of these

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
pathways

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,160
uh that's the that's the question over

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,600
here

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,000
so again in the next slide uh let's

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
again examine some pathways with a more

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
technical focus

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,399
so some of the technical pathways might

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,880
include adding a new feature

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
then documentation fixing existing bugs

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,120
and branching issues

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
refactoring existing work to improve it

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
performing

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,839
quality assurance improving user

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
interface and user experience

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,440
release engineering creating and

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,079
maintaining project group map

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
code and user interface localization and

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,600
so on

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,880
so again ask yourself does your project

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
currently offer new

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
and existing contributors opportunities

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,079
to contribute rewardingly

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,360
to or even take ownership of work

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,000
in each of these pathways uh if not

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
one general way to begin uh expanding

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
your project

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,279
is by making concerned uh if concerted

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,920
efforts to

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,640
formally like refine document and

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,480
advertise these contributor pathways

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,680
so uh in this moving on

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,160
uh in the next slide let's

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,160
explore uh these challenges associated

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,360
with maintaining a project

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,200
sustaining its growth and

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,640
as our prior like expansion efforts

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,760
succeed right

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,839
so in the next slide now we

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,920
look at some of the common challenges

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
again uh so these include

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,600
additional infrastructure and overhead

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
adding additional tooling and

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,560
infrastructure creates additional work

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,240
of coordinating participants time

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,320
otherwise

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,360
which would have been spent in the

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
project code

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
or especially for smaller leaders who

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
may have to take on responsibilities for

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
deploying

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,600
and maintaining those new systems in

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,959
addition

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,480
uh to coordinating volunteer work then

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,800
there comes challenge of preserving

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,839
community intimacy uh

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,120
preserving the intimacy of a community

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,120
uh is very important because

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
it's this community intimacy that makes

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,800
it so appealing

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,519
and it requires more care as the

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,399
community

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
keeps on expanding so very few people

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,480
may

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,240
actually know one another and when this

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,560
starts happening social bonds weaken um

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,320
the next thing is keeping a growing

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
number of participants involved

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,600
so keeping all participants informed

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
about project

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,880
development requires more time and

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
effort if that

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
community is large managing competing

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,320
visions for the project

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,399
as a community grows competing visions

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,200
for the project might create contributor

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,360
tension

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,959
uh especially people who are newer to

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,880
the project might feel confused

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,800
where where should they uh like proceed

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,000
ahead with uh which vision can they

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,079
focus on

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,680
um and the last point again is

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
architecting and scaling or mission

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
innovation

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
projects that begin as a personal hobby

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,760
don't always have

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
explicit and clearly refined community

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,480
mission and vision statement

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,959
without these projects don't scale there

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,720
um moving on uh let's talk about

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,839
uh governance models um so in the next

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,480
slide

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,079
yeah so every project and community will

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,480
need to address these challenges

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,560
in ways that are most effective for them

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,279
however in general we suggest

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,199
uh beginning to address these challenges

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,160
by examining your project's governance

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,440
model

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,600
the specific combination of rules and

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,600
customs that define who gets to do what

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,440
and how they're supposed to do it

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,880
is called a project own model

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,480
the better you understand the project's

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
governance model the greater your

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
chances of successfully helping that

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
project evolve

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
so as you are looking for ways to help

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,880
sustain project

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,279
growth and success we recommend

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,639
beginning by examining your

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,839
project's governance models in the

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,560
next slide we talk about

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,760
six common governance models found in

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,079
open source project

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
so every project has a governance model

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,079
even ones that

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,199
say that they don't really have one so

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,360
begin by filling

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,279
down specific details of the way the

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,480
project is running today

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,839
here's a list of uh most common types of

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
governance models

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,120
uh especially in open source projects we

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
don't have the time

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,800
uh to explore the individual model

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,000
however suffice

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,920
to say that knowing how your project is

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,760
running and who is making decisions

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
is the perfect way to begin thinking

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,399
about making the project

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,199
more sustainable uh if your project lie

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
relies on

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,639
too few people if decisions aren't being

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
made in the most

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,920
effective ways then begin by addressing

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,480
these

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,720
issues moving on to the next slide

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,519
we have we talk about the dimensions of

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
governance

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,040
so fundamentally you will need to think

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,040
you need to begin thinking about various

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,760
roles people play in the community and

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,839
the various

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,000
policies and procedures that go on and

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,000
direct people in those roles

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
roles are the specific functions and

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,959
contributors perform in and for the

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,959
project

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,399
roles have rights responsibilities and

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,320
expectations around them

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,759
make sure that these are explicitly

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,160
documented

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
policies and procedures are the specific

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,920
rules and processes

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
that direct people in particular roles

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
and define the limits of acceptable

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,320
behavior for the project

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,959
as best practices etc so make sure that

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,519
these are also explicitly documented

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,360
uh simply documenting roles policies and

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,759
procedures will go a long way

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
toward helping your project become more

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,839
sustainable

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
and uh finally moving on to the next uh

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,759
slide

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,240
uh we talk about popularizing

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
how do you popularize a project uh how

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,880
do you

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,800
increase a project's visibility making

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,440
it an appealing destination for

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,399
users and contributors and keeping it

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,880
relevant in an ever growing ecosystem

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
so in the next next slide we again talk

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,040
about

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
uh the common challenges uh so this

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
include

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
increased competition for contributors

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
time and energy uh

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,120
competing for contributors time

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
attention energy is becoming more

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
difficult than ever as the number of

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,920
open source projects

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,759
increases globally uh community

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,800
materials available

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,000
in a limited number of languages so

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,199
when projects become popular uh they

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
connect with

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,880
diverse groups of contributors but often

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
what happens is that the project

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,079
materials are only available in a

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,279
limited number of languages

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,759
and if your community is not

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,639
communicating in english many people may

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,680
not even

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,440
be aware that it exists this is a very

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,000
common challenge across

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,600
all like most major projects

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
then there is the growing threat of

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,439
maintainer burnout as a project becomes

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,799
more popular maintenance might

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,679
experience burnout when

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,520
trying to keep pace with it uh

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,319
mismatched expectations between

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,919
enterprise and users and copies is

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
always a big challenge

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,679
and then there is the proliferation of

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,319
platforms for user engagement

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,480
uh finding the best ways to reach your

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,000
potential users and contributors can be

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
really time consuming

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,919
especially given the way people choose

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,280
to consume information

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,080
nation uh so uh

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,720
users now uh expect to hear things about

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,600
uh

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,960
like hear about things on things like on

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,679
platforms like reddit

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
facebook twitter and so on um so

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
figuring out where to meet people and

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,320
where they are

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,520
when you are like and where you are

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,559
it's it's a very tricky question and

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,240
that is that becomes a very big

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,600
challenge for the community

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,520
um so let's move on uh since we are

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
almost out of time let's talk about

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,760
reward models

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,559
and to interrupt you we have only one

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,840
more minutes

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,360
and we need to okay okay

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,120
okay sure yeah so uh as with all the

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
challenges we addressed so far uh we

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,039
could

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,640
discuss many uh things uh here but in

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,360
general we have found that focusing on

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,600
our projects

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,720
reward models is a great place to begin

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,799
with uh

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
so i won't talk much about rod models

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,360
because we don't have much time over

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
here uh so

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,760
i think if you could just uh move

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,799
forward a couple of slides

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,799
to slide number

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
that

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,280
yeah so yeah so

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,000
there's an overview of uh general kinds

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,799
of challenges

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,240
uh this is this was more of a just an

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,000
overview of the different types of

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,039
challenges that you're going to face as

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,360
you assume

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,960
a leadership role uh expanding the

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,039
community maintaining that growth

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,160
sustainably and popularizing a project

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
along that way

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
uh we are already out of time uh but

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,960
yeah

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,240
just uh to just uh to give you a sense

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,280
of like

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,320
to do a quick review uh here's uh what

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,440
we might

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,200
have next so in the next slides we

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
i just wanted to talk about measuring

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,559
success but i

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
knew i would be out of time so uh here

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,559
are just a few

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,559
uh keywords to remember when you're

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,480
tracking the technical contributions

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,880
and as we move forward a couple of

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
slides

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,240
um again i did a quick

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,559
workload of how you can track

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,679
non-technical configurations

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,360
so yeah and in the end

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,640
uh i i would just uh

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,480
want to say that you know people choose

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
to lead open source projects for various

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
reasons

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
including organizational needs a sense

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,039
of personal

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,640
responsibility or personal fulfillment

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,280
by choosing to lead an open source

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,559
project

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,320
you are especially assumed

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
an increased responsibility for that

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,600
project successful failure

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,720
new community leaders face challenges

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,159
related to expanding

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,559
maintaining and popularizing their

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,400
projects and they can begin

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,799
to address these challenges by examining

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,120
their projects contribution pathways

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,000
governance models and reward models

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,440
so they will need to determine the best

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,799
way to gather feedback from their

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
communities and

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,200
to communicate the value and success of

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,600
their work various stakeholders

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,360
um so that with that i would like to

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,880
conclude my talk uh

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,919
all i would be sharing the slides on

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:57,039
the discord channel and with venka

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,039
so that you can also share it

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,480
