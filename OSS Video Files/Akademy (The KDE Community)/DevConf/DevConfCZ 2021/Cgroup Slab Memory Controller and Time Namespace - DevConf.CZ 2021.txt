Control group (cgroup) and namespace are the two major features in the Linux kernel that make containers possible.

There are some exciting new cgroup and namespace features in the latest Linux kernel that can improve the container experience. This talk will focus on two major features that are being back-ported to the RHEL8 kernel, namely the new cgroup slab memory controller and time namespace. This talk will describe what these features are and some discussion on their underlying implementation as well as what improvement they will bring to the container experience.
