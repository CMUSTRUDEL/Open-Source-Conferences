Imagine there would be a simple way to enable tests in the CI. Imagine the configuration would be consistent across Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, GitHub… so you would not have to always learn a new syntax for each. Imagine you could easily open source tests and share them across different distros. Imagine you could enter your component git repository, type just seven letters and all tests would be safely executed in your preferred environment. Imagine writing or debugging a test and reviewing test results would be a joyful task. Imagine… Or, do not imagine but come & try yourself:

* Learn how to use the new tmt command line tool
* Enable a simple test in the CI using a pull request
* Create a new test for your component, track coverage
* Safely and easily execute tests from your laptop
* Run and debug test code in your preferred environment
* Overview of Fedora CI support, Packit GitHub integration
* Real-life examples, hands-on experience, space for questions

Prerequisites:
Required: Laptop with Fedora, Fedora account, FPCA signed
Recommended: A package for experimenting / contributions
Optional: A test suitable for CI
