Title: Taking matters into my own hands - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-15
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: Alexis Monville

At the end of the session, you will know the one thing you have to act on when you are back in your organization to increase your impact and satisfaction.

Pranay struggles with her coder job. Everything seems always to fall apart and ends up in tiring and stressful firefighting sessions.

Pranay tried different solutions, and nothing is really working until that one thing she discovered. A not so subtle change in the way she looks at the world will bring her ways to increase her impact and satisfaction at work.

The session is a real-world practical one that helps you increase your impact and satisfaction at work no matter who you work with.


In the session, we will follow Pranay, a fictional character who struggles in her current team. The people around her are clueless. Along the way, Pranay learns something from the people she interacts with that gets her thinking in a new way enabling her to take a different course of action.

at the end of this session

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,960
you will have identified one change to

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,760
put in place

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,480
right now to increase your impact and

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,480
satisfaction

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
what can you see

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,640
i bet if we were in a big conference

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,359
room i would hear some of you

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,240
saying a smile because it's the

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,640
incredible capability of our brain to

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,239
recognize patterns

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:41,360
and this is with a smile that i started

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,640
my day i'm i was thinking of pretty

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,120
positive things and it brings a smile on

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
my face

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:59,840
can we do it right now can you try to

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,840
remember positive events

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,400
i had also planned to tell you

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,520
face your neighbor make eye contact and

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,000
smile as much as you can because it is a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
really exciting way to experiment with

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,240
the mirroring effect

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,240
can we do that in front of our screens

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
so taking matters into my own hands at

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
the end of the session

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
you will have identified one change to

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,360
put in place right now

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,360
to increase your impact and satisfaction

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,240
one change mick prani

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
she's a software engineer she felt so

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,200
good

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
when she took that job everything

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
sounded so great

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,000
she felt it was exactly the right spot

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
for her

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
now she struggles in her job all things

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,360
always seems to fall apart

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
and the end in endless fire fighting

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,000
sessions

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
she tries to find a way nothing worked

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
she feels she is just a small piece of

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,599
wood

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,879
carried by the flow of a rapid driver

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
until she finds that thing to change

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,160
i'm aleximovil i'm on the emea

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
leadership team i tried that

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,879
and the story i will tell you today is a

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,160
prequel to the one of my second book

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,319
i'm a software engineer and i'm in

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,319
charge the book i wrote with michael

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,519
doyle

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
the story will enable you to identify

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
one thing to change

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,840
to increase your impact and satisfaction

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
network

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,959
for prani it happened when she attended

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,280
a conference

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,959
she found that one thing that changed

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
everything

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,680
that day one of the presenters

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,720
asked a simple question how will you

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,440
measure your life

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,640
pranay took note of the question and she

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,959
started to think about it

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,560
during the following days she returned

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,360
to the question and drafted

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
what she thought her life should be to

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
call it a success

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
she explored all the different areas of

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
life of course not only the professional

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,640
aspects

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
she started to have a satisfying picture

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,280
in mind

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,840
of what it should be but now how to get

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
there

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,879
the question reminder what another

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,159
presenter mentioned

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,599
you have as much influence that you

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,760
think you have

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,280
and to support its claim the presenter

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
draw a first year call

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
meant to represent what you can really

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
act upon

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,799
he then draw a second circle outside the

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,519
first one

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
showing what you could really influence

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,159
but

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
outside of that what can you do

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
the soup is what is outside the second

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
circle

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,799
the soup analogy is useful because as

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,720
the two first circles of what we can act

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,519
upon and what we can influence are well

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,919
known

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,759
this simple knowledge tends to make us

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,120
powerless

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
it is learned helplessness the soup id

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
pushes us to

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,479
find a way to influence even slightly

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,680
what we thought we could not affect

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,840
so if you don't want a cold and tasty

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,600
soup

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,320
take the big pot of soup and put it on

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,120
the stove and what happens

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
nothing nothing immediately but after

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
some time

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,720
a long time something happens the small

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,560
bubble pops up at the surface so first

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,080
share the id that changed the soup

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,320
you can change the soup make it make it

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,800
a little bit hotter add salt and pepper

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
to make it slightly tastier

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,560
the soup analogy is there to push

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,840
ourselves to expand

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,840
our circles

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,639
pranay knows that to accomplish anything

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,680
of value

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,479
she would need allies and she found a

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
great way

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,320
to get to know the other people in a

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,759
book from porschetang

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,520
the dream team nightmare

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,919
it's a technique to meet one-on-one

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,240
using a straightforward structure

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,320
that prana represented on small proceed

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,759
notes that she brings with her

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,000
for one-on-ones of course now that

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
we all work from home pranay has a

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
trello board to do that

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
and you can find how it works following

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,680
that link

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,759
to introduce the practice planet just

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
told her teammate

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,639
hey i found something that we could use

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
to onboard the next newcomers in our

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,680
team

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
would you want to try it with me to

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
assess if it could work

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
and here they go

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,560
overcoming the first impression is hard

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
we have to avoid the temptation to use

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
our intellect

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,880
to confirm our first impression

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,960
making the effort to overcoming the

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,960
first impression is the way

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
to create peace in the world

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,280
pali knows now that to increase our

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,520
impact and satisfaction

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,000
it starts with there but it is just the

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
beginning

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:48,400
so yes it starts with you it starts

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:52,319
with self self reflection

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
and then it continues with expanding

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,120
our circles overcoming learned

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
helplessness

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,759
brian tracy told the story that he

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,759
presents well

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,319
how it affects us when elephant trainers

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,199
catch a baby elephant they tie one of

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,720
its legs to a post with a rope

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,280
and the baby elephant struggles and

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
struggle but he can't get free

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
for days the elephant pulls and strains

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,319
at the rope gradually

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,560
it learns that struggle is useless and

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,759
it gives up

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,479
when the elephant grows the trainer

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,520
keeps it keeps it tied to the same rope

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
in the same way and

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,039
even so it can now break through open

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
gateway

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,319
it stands passively and wait for the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,880
trainer to come and get it

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,720
it has developed what is called learned

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,080
helplessness it has learned that the

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
struggle is useless

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
and as a result of repeated failure

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,520
experiences

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,560
earlier in life the elephant has learned

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
the self-imposed

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,080
imitation

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
so yes it starts with you it starts with

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
expanding

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,400
your circle and it continues with

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
getting to know others and building the

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
relationships

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,319
the struggle does not go away magically

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,280
pranay looked for a way to focus our

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,599
energy on

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,039
what is really important for our goal

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
and she found a technique called

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,599
impact mapping in a book from go

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,599
ecologic

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,159
it works like this start with four

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,080
simple columns

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
why who are what

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,760
why are we doing this this is the goal

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,519
we are trying to achieve the why here is

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,519
we want to have a fantastic picnic

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,880
with woo with our partner of course

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,040
the who is who can produce the desired

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,440
effect we can obstruct it

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
who are the consumers or the users of

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
our product

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,320
who will be impacted by it these

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,560
are the actors who can influence the

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,800
outcome

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,360
but could be annoying if there were

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,399
mosquitoes coming

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,640
how should our actors behavior

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,800
change how can they help us to achieve

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,839
the goal how can the obstructor prevent

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,680
us from succeeding these are the impacts

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,920
that we are trying to create one thing

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
could be that they don't show up and we

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,720
can imagine a lot of

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,720
what the fourth column to solve that

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
fix the watering system to avoid growing

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,399
new mosquitoes or repulsive plants

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,880
by annoying high frequencies on devices

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,120
what can we do as an organization or a

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,560
delivery team to support the required

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
impact

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,800
these are the deliverables the software

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
features and organizational activities

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
the behavior we really don't want in the

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
in that

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,959
is that in case they show up they don't

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
buy it

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,600
offloation could work and if you stick

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,560
to the behavioral change you can free up

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,519
the creativity

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,600
of the team to find what and you can try

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
several options

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
this is also the best way to define your

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,680
goals

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,760
you can measure the impact you want to

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,920
have without knowing yet

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
what to do to get to the impact you want

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
this is the best way to define oklas

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,600
objectives

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,839
and key results the why is the objective

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,320
and the key result is the impact

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,040
no mosquito bite bite at the picnic

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,040
so praveen created her own chaos and she

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
introduced her chaos to her colleagues

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
one by one

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
and some of them said hey i know how to

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,279
help you with that one

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,240
those interactions helped her refine the

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,839
impact map

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,880
and create better rkrs she did not sell

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
her perspective she improved her goal

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,279
thanks to the diversity of perspective

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,720
in her team

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:15,839
and progressively it became team okayers

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
and they joined forces

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,600
remember as christina woodkey said

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
during one of the episodes of

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,959
the podcast you've got to avoid the

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,959
selection of the task

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,240
you need to really think about the

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,240
outcome the impact

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,519
this is the right time to tell you to

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,880
listen to a lear podcast

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,399
on emerging leadership you can find it

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
everywhere

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
so it starts with you expanding your

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
circles and building relationship with

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,560
others

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,560
it continues with defining goals

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,120
using impact mapping

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,720
and okrs which becomes shared okrs with

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,480
the team

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,839
and it does not have to start from the

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,279
top it can't

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,200
start with you so because

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,120
you know what are the things that are

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
the most important you want to focus

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,040
your time and

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,000
see on those things what pranay found is

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,959
that

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,959
there were already three types of time

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,000
time for synchronization

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,240
to make sure we are all on the same page

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
synchronization time is when team

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
members

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,160
share their progress challenges learning

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
so they

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,320
all can stay on the same page align

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,000
toward the same goal

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,720
during synchronization time we can

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
identify we can identify opportunities

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
for activities that will fall into the

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,440
two other types of time

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,839
it could be an opportunity of

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
collaboration understanding and solving

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,760
an issue

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,279
or possibility of training in a specific

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,279
area to take two examples

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,800
collaboration time is when two or more

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
people work together

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,360
to accomplish specific activity the

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,480
collaboration is key to benefit from the

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,720
diversity of perspectives in the team

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,920
collaboration to benefit from the

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
instant feedback of

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
other team members like when you are

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
engaged in better programming or even

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,480
more programming

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:28,240
really working together which is

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
what a team can really do

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,200
and time for focalization with no

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,519
interruption no notifications

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
so you don't waste any time switching

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,920
context and coming back

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,120
to your original task prior on our team

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
defined catcher

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,040
who will deal with the interruptions for

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,279
the rest of the team

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,560
for each of the focus sessions the new

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,199
capture is

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,199
is defined

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,800
and they are focusing on one thing at a

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,480
time

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,680
to refine their use of time the team put

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,760
on paper their team agreement

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,760
you always need team agreement even when

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,399
you are going to throw axes on good

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,959
targets

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,680
you need team agreement and the fifth

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,440
one

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,920
applies to a lot of different contexts

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
by the way

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
pranay found an efficient way to start

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,600
drafting the team agreement

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
of the team social contract by using the

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
six questions

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,760
patrick clenching proposes in his book

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,760
the advantage

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,839
why do we exist how do we behave

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
like how we handle conflicts for example

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,600
or how we use

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
shared documents to enable asynchronous

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
collaboration without the need for

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,600
another meeting

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,920
which also enables the more introverts

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,600
to contribute more efficiently

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,360
what do we do how will we succeed

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,399
what is the most important right now

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,040
a good impact map here is important

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
prioritizing the impact the how is much

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,480
easier than

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
sorting an infinite list of what

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,600
we must do what this question addresses

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,079
roles and responsibilities

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,680
so that we can avoid the issues of false

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,440
expectation

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,320
i believe that the manager should do

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,279
packs another team member's job is to do

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,199
why

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,160
and then the other ones don't think at

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,160
all it's their duty

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,880
so it starts with you expanding your

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,279
circles and building relationship with

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,160
others

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,000
it continues with defining goals using

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,800
impact mapping and okl's

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,399
okay ours which become shared occurs for

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
the team

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,040
and finally a strategic use of time

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,079
defined in continuously updated

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,959
team agreements updated after each

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,600
retrospective for example

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,680
and about the use of time they also

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
agreed to use the speed limiting feature

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,959
of their calendar

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,639
and always leave five minutes or ten

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,120
minutes as breaks

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,399
some of them are even using those breaks

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
for short meditation

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,920
station

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,639
also quickly discovered that there was a

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,440
significant need for time to celebrate

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,199
as a team their successes

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,360
so they added that to their team

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,680
agreement

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,440
and i hope you will too because as

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
pranaya's team did

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,800
this is how you increase your impact and

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
satisfaction

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,480
it starts with you clear goals and a

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,480
perfect use of time as a team

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
but where's wally you may have noticed

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,680
that

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,000
ponies manager is not mentioned in the

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
story

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,120
is the manager a lazy absentee or

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,480
a brilliant genius we don't know from

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,679
the story

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,919
what do you think what we know is that

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
the manager understands how to let

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,919
initiative happen in the team

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,600
maybe the manager is encouraging

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,360
fostering initiative from behind the

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,760
scenes

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:33,280
how can you do something like that or

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:35,840
influence something like that to happen

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,840
in coaching on mentoring sessions i use

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,120
what i call the four beps axes

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,480
of a leader maps stands for business

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,799
execution people and system beps helps

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
people realize when they don't invest at

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,039
all in one or more

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,400
of the axis execution is usually not the

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,559
main problem

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,799
can be a problem for managers when they

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,200
are deep in execution

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,559
up to defining the prices tasks each

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,440
person should work on

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,840
and going too deep they forgot the other

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
axes

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,720
people hiring growing

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
managing performance self-improve could

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
be more of a problem

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
sometimes i feel people tend to

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,160
passively delegate to the short

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,799
moments of the great work that has to

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,520
happen

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,520
on that ax

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,880
system is a big one and usually

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,480
one that suffers from under investment

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,559
understanding the system from

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
by the people the organization the

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,240
processes and tools

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,440
remove the obstacles to great work as we

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,280
deming said a bad system will beat good

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,280
people each time

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,440
managers have usually more power to

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,120
influence system changes

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,039
and the end our investment usually

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,679
creates a complexity depth

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,520
with layers of complexity piling up on

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,200
each other

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
simplify could be a good mentor

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,640
and finally business understanding the

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,440
business the ecosystem the organization

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,919
evolves in

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
understanding why we provide solutions

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,280
products features

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,280
services and formulate a clear vision

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,840
are your activities balanced on the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,840
bab's axis

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,720
is it possible for your team

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,520
sometimes people tell me it could work

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
in a startup

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,720
but for our organization it's not really

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
possible

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,160
so just imagine that you are sick so you

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,240
have an appointment with medical doctor

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
so let me introduce the doctor stock

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,400
photo here

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,679
would you be fine with an answer from

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,120
our dear doctor

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,760
like you're sick it's bad

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
so let me call your parents and i will

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,679
tell them that they have to start from

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,679
scratch

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:11,120
not really a satisfying answer right

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,440
the only reasonable answer is

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,440
change

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,039
i wish that you picked one change from

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,640
today even a small one

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,480
it could be the self-reflection

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,840
journaling practice or maybe the

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,080
one-on-one getting to know each other

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,919
one of the people who tried that told me

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,520
that after 30 minutes he felt he was

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,880
speaking to an old friend

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,880
so it's really a good one one change

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,200
okay so we have few pre-submitted

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,520
questions um

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,640
maybe this one also relates to one of

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,960
the keynotes we had

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,159
last year it was about psychological

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,440
safety

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,919
so a team is capable to express

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,039
difficulties to his manager if it feels

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,320
psychologically safe and

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,200
only a leader capable of showing this

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,159
vulnerable vulnerability can increase

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,240
his team's psychological safety

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,280
how a leader can show this vulnerability

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,559
without the right the grading his trust

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,559
from the team oh sorry

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,400
it's uh it's it's it's a challenging one

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,080
so the

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,520
the question came with a lot of

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,120
assumption

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,720
so one of the assumptions that that we

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,799
can see in the question is oh

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,200
the leader is there because he's great

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,840
so if he's showing vulnerability then

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,120
is not great so it's not the leader and

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,600
said that's a

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,880
that's the kind of environment when you

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,919
you are

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,799
fostering that me uh i'm there because

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,240
i'm great

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,320
and you're there because you're not so

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,679
if you foster that kind of environment

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,640
uh rewarding

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,679
uh that kind of behavior that's more me

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,480
than we

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,799
in the team so it's uh it's little a

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,280
little bit difficult

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,120
but to change that if the leader shows

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,360
some vulnerability you we all

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,480
will make mistakes so it's quite easy to

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,720
find mistakes

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,799
uh that you are making and really be

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,480
clear about yep you made the mistake you

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,159
don't blame anybody else

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,679
for that mistake or you you can

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,440
just say it or maybe the first time it

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,720
hurts a little bit it hurts a little bit

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,919
the ego but

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,640
you don't want to let the ego on the way

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:46,159
of creating a great team so i think

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,480
how to show it just pick the mistakes

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
that

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
you you are making by the way everybody

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
can see them

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,480
so don't think that if you don't say it

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,600
uh it will be okay

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,520
everybody everybody will miss them

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,080
and don't believe that

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,000
because you are showing vulnerability

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,480
people will not trust you

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
i think it's totally the opposite being

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,400
transparent on

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,039
your struggles i think will help people

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,159
to uh

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:23,840
to appreciate better what is going on

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:26,480
and probably trust you more

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,360
thanks um another one how do you handle

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,520
diversity

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,520
in a team um

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,840
it depends a little bit on how how it

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,000
works so

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,240
um there's one aspect of diversity that

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
is really interesting is we are

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
we all have different personality

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,880
profiles

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,240
and there's one thing that you need to

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,840
to really be aware of we

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,120
like people that are like you like us

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,000
um so i've seen teams with nearly all

00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,919
the people

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
with the same personality profile which

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
is really interesting you say

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,760
look at that you say wow how they do

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,000
that but that's really easy they are

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,559
your people they like

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,919
so they don't hire people for particular

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,600
skills or competency

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,240
all they all what they will tell you

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,760
about that is

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,000
ps because no they they just

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,320
pick the people they like in interviews

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,360
and they make their decision in the 15th

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,880
the 15th first seconds that's what we

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,559
are doing all the time that when

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,320
we met people we know that

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,919
there's something that's something good

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,520
with that person we like

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,960
like that person immediately or the

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,880
opposite so

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,720
that's the first thing to know is we

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,279
have really

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
big biases so we need to fight our

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,720
biases

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,600
so if we want to build diversity in the

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,440
team

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,559
we need first to recognize that we have

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,080
biases and we need to study that

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,640
and to put in place hiring practices and

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,960
panels that will help us

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,159
get to different perspective in the team

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,559
and if our team is

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
already not diverse enough we need to

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,080
get help from other

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,480
other people outside of our team and to

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,120
build diversity

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,840
the good thing is by having diversity

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,480
then we

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,440
will force people push people push

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,080
ourselves

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,520
to work with people we don't like at

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,000
first

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,840
though that means we will benefit from

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
the diversity of them

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,039
thank you so um maybe

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
another one um so there is like this

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,679
trend

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,880
that uh

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,039
of self-leading teams and you mentioned

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
that with like building your own okrs

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
etc

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,200
what if there are people who don't

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,279
desire

00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,159
to be leaders what if they want to be

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,159
told what to do

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,679
yeah that's a that's that's a very good

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,919
point um

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,400
and it happens um it happens often that

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,200
uh

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,480
in if you are in an environment where

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,120
are

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,080
you the boss is already in command and

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,200
control

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,720
is telling you all what to do um in a

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,799
way

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,799
your life sucks but that's your life

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,840
that's your life at work you do what you

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,799
have been asked

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,559
and you are we were rewarded to do

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,000
because you do it

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,440
it's in a way really comfortable but is

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,720
it really

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,840
what you were hoping at the beginning

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,600
so that's why i'm thinking i'm thinking

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,279
that you can push a little bit more the

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
envelope and change a little bit the

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,760
dynamic

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,760
of course there's people that will not

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,440
want to change either the manager will

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
not want to change all they don't want

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,480
to change

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,840
but when you are in in a team like that

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,880
and you can see that the manager could

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:11,120
potentially change

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,600
you can you can work with the others to

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,279
to try to go a little bit further to

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,159
change a little bit the dynamic because

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,240
they are all

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,399
self-fulfilling prophecies if you

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,279
believe that

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,120
the manager wants covenant control the

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,960
manager will see no initiative

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,039
will see no initiative from the team

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,399
member so he will think that he needs to

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,720
do all that

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,919
he cannot delegate he needs to tell

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,840
people what to do

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,200
but when he sees initiative maybe at

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,799
some point you will realize that you

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,600
don't need to

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,600
so uh that's a that's an interesting

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
thing sometimes you ask the managers why

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,640
are you doing that this way

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,640
tells you because the people don't want

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
and when you ask the people why are you

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
not taking initiative because the

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,120
managers don't want

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,799
and when one of them change suddenly you

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,840
can change everything

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,880
so that would be interesting to try

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,520
and to help other people that maybe you

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,720
think

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,760
they don't want to be led but maybe they

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,559
won't

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,039
and sometimes they don't want to take

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,840
initiative because for them it's unclear

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,880
what needs to be done it's unclear if

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,600
there's a

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,679
uh a clear there's no clear direction

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,320
there's no clear strategy there

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,480
that's that there's a big there's a big

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,520
space out there

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,559
we need to do things but our day-to-day

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,320
connects with

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,240
the goals of the company we don't really

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,799
know and when there's too

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,640
too much uncertainty about about that it

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,520
doesn't work so you need to have

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
clear goals clear strategy to be able to

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,520
to

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,520
do something and take initiatives

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,320
thank you for that okay we have a

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,279
question from the audience

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,760
and so how do you deal with people that

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:03,200
don't perform

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,200
as good in team maybe consistently

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,120
that that this is this is a challenging

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,480
one

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,200
once again it comes with a few

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,200
assumptions that

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,080
how do how do you assess the performance

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,840
and how do you assess it's good or not

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,159
oh there's there's something that is

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,279
important to to understand there

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:27,840
um assuming that we have an agreement on

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,840
what means a good performance

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,559
we need to make sure that the people

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
knows that this is this

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,679
they are aware of that agreement they

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,640
are they understand what good

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,480
performance means

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,960
we need also to understand why it's

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,600
happening sometimes people

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,159
are really trying but they don't have

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,960
something they lack something to be able

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,640
to to perform it could be something

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,240
related to the job or that could be an

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,440
external factor

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,520
that will prevent them to to

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,360
to work at a specific moment in time

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,960
and you have different choices you you

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,720
can help them

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,799
and that's where collaboration is really

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,640
uh really important

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,480
it's incredible what you can learn in a

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,200
per programming session

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
um that learn from each other i mean

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
that's

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,840
sometimes there's someone that is more

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,760
advanced than the other but

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,320
both of them will learn that's like in a

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,320
mentoring session

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,679
mentees usually already thank their

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,960
mentor and

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,039
i'm always i'm always smiling about that

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,640
because usually

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,039
in mentoring sessions i am

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
i learn a lot when i'm the mentor i

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,279
learn a lot when i'm the mentee so it's

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,399
a really social learning experiment

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,640
so you need to to think about

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:54,399
that low performance in the way of

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,919
assessing that are we clear about what

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,000
what is the level of performance

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,559
expected and

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,200
try to find the root cause of why that

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,039
why that low performance happens

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,039
and when you already try to do that

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,120
sincerely um

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,399
you can understand if it's something

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,039
that can be fixable

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
or not sometimes it's not fixable

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,600
there's

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,840
some people that are taking jobs that

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,840
they should not take

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,519
okay we have another one

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,159
and that's how do you deal with a

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,760
manager

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,440
who is micromanaging his employees

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:39,039
or her employees uh and

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,360
uh maybe i'll add another one to that uh

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,559
how do you deal with conflicts in the

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,760
team

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,960
oh yes that's uh that's big so the micro

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,279
managing i touch

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,720
on it is the uh the execution so you

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,159
have a manager that is focused on

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,440
execution

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,000
but does not trust the people to

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,000
know what to do that there's there could

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,760
be several reasons about that

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
so usually people don't know what to do

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,640
because

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,480
because they don't know what is the

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,240
strategy what are the goals

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,000
are what is expected from them so

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,039
as they don't know that they cannot take

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,240
initiative so

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,919
the manager is giving them exact tasks

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,799
to do something it's uh it's annoying

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,039
because uh

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,880
basically you are not doing your job um

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,519
your choice is doing part of it

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,840
you don't think about all the rest you

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,480
are focused on neon execution

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,000
and it's a little bit frustrating to be

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,000
in that situation

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,679
so if you are the manager

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,120
you should think twice before doing that

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,039
because you're losing your time you're

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,320
losing the energy of the people working

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,519
with you

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,440
and why do you i already bright people

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,000
if you don't want to use

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,960
their brightness you're basically

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,440
destroying them the day after they

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,320
they are their capability of initiative

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,600
if you are

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,679
in the other position you

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,120
can probably have that conversation with

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,240
your manager saying okay

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,440
i think i understand what i have to do

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,399
there

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,600
um can you tell me more about why we are

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,600
doing that

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,240
can you tell me more about what is the

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,840
impact that we want to reach

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,240
can you give me a little bit more of the

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,519
context and

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,960
why that will help me it's uh that can

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,519
help me next time

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,640
to be able to define the next task that

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,679
needs to be

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,799
to be done to achieve that impact and in

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,679
doing that

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,919
i will really view from uh part of the

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,960
of what you are doing for me

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,760
and i think i can handle that

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,840
so having that conversation it will not

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,640
work with the first conversation

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,399
because usually those managers that are

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,519
defining precise tasks

00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,320
are used to do that this way and they

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,080
they forget to to share the context they

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
are not used to share the context the

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,880
impact the goals

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,079
that's not something they are used to do

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,159
so they will be a little bit

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
surprised and not necessarily able to do

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,440
it but

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,560
progressively you can probably handle

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,159
that

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,240
that you need to train your manager a

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,359
little bit

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,560
thank you the second

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,679
question about conflict is a fun one

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,040
um for a lot of time i

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,839
i thought about conflict in a in a way

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,839
that was

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,000
basically there's a conflict um

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,399
conflict is because i'm right and the

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,200
other the other

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,599
is wrong i'm doing things in the right

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,800
way

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,000
they are doing things in the wrong way

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,760
so i need to fix them and they don't

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,920
want to change

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,520
so now if you if you change your

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,440
perspective and you go

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,720
around the table you take the position

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,200
of the other person

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,800
you realize that suddenly you agree on

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,040
something

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,640
you both think the other is wrong you

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,400
both think the other is not doing the

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,000
right thing

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,800
so that's where you have a conflict

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,560
so the usual ways of solving conflict in

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,040
organization like that when you are when

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,320
you

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,440
stay on your position is to escalate

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,280
the conflict to higher level managers

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:35,920
that will help you with their

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,359
big wisdom to solve the conflict um

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,240
have you seen that working probably not

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,119
really often

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,440
so the other way is to try to understand

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,880
the perspective of the other person

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:53,200
try to understand why

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,440
why do they think this is a good idea

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,240
because how do you know your opinion is

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,480
right

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,680
sometimes we have really strong opinions

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,880
about things but

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,599
how do we know we are right so

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,280
investigating a little bit more about

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,000
different perspective

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,760
not necessarily going to the person that

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,599
you are in conflict with but maybe

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,880
you're looking at with your peers

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,599
saying okay i i think it's blue

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,920
it says it's red uh i don't want you to

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,920
take

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:27,280
side i want you to help me understand

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,800
how we access colors

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,359
and where where i have where i have

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,280
something that i'm missing

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,480
it will give you the other arguments the

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
other points

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,520
of data of information you need to look

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,920
for

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,240
to try to understand what is going on

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,760
and sometimes you will realize that

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,359
that's not one that is right on the

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,079
other that is wrong that

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,760
you are probably both wrong but there's

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,400
no way to know what is right

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,920
so you will need to make a choice but at

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,839
least you can

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,119
make a step in the direction of the

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,880
other person

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:08,000
with more to share and more to learn

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:10,560
and that can probably solve the conflict

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
you alexis uh and thank you everyone for

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,320

uh today we're very close to the

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,160
end of our time slot so what about one

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,640
final message

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:26,720
alexi one final message um

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,760
[Laughter]

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,480
it could be a goodbye yeah so the

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,839
one final message pick the one change uh

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,680
you want to make

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,200
pick the one small thing you want to

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,400
make and

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,240
be kind with yourself um if you are

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,680
don't succeed the first day try again

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,000
the other day that's not

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,880
that's not really a problem usually we

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,240
think we lack

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,680
the willpower because it's just vicious

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,599
circles that uh

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,760
when we think we lack the willpower we

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,400
try something and we give up

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,720
and this is decreasing our amount of

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,040
willpower so we need to build that

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,240
to rebuild our willpower step by step

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,520
day by day

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,680
and they're just being kind with

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,119
ourselves we try something it didn't

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
work let's try the next day

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,880

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,160
one day

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,320

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,240
six months have passed and you never
