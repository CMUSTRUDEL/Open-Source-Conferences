Description: 
	Speaker: Peter Malina


My heart skips a beat every time there's the *new tool that will solve your DevOps*. Working in a team, one can realize fairly fast that the tooling is not the problem most of the time. People are. In this talk, I want to zoom in on the possibilities of building a DevOps *culture*, instead of investing millions into tooling and wasting the time of people constantly re-learning new tools.

Agenda:
- The rabbit holes of DevOps
- No, DevOps is not a single person working for two
- Don't pick what you want, pick what you need
- Tools don't work autonomously - one tool at a time -
- How automation wastes time in certain situations
- Make a consensus
