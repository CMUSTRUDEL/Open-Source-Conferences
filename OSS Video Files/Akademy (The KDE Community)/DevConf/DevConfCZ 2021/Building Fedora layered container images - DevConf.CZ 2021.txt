Publication date: 2021-03-17

Description: 
	Speaker: Athos Ribeiro



The OpenShift Build Service (OSBS) is a collection of tools, workflows and integration points that build and release layered container images.
OSBS is used with Fedora's build system (koji) to build the layered images shipped in registry.fedoraproject.org.
In this session, we will give you an overview of what happens behind the
curtains when a container image build is triggered in the Fedora
infrastructure and what you need to do to include an image in
registry.fedoraproject.org.
