Responsible AI: Building ethical practices in your software development lifecycle
Advancements in AI are different than other technologies because of the pace of innovation, and its proximity to human intelligence - impacting us at a personal and societal level. The industry today is optimistic about the incredible potential for AI and other advanced technologies to empower people, widely benefiting current and future generations, thereby working for the common good.

However, nearly 9 out of 10 organizations across countries have encountered ethical issues resulting from the use of AI. As Microsoft, we recognize that these same technologies also raise important challenges that we need to address clearly, thoughtfully, and affirmatively. In this talk, I will present Microsoft's approach towards Responsible AI, talking about the six principles to develop technology responsibly.
This will be a focussed session where I will start with a demo of how, if not used properly, AI can lead to biases. Post that we will go into Microsoft's principles and how they lead to an efficient system - showcasing how the same demo will look after incorporating the Responsible AI Principles.
