Publication date: 2021-03-15
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: Josip Vilicic

If you've ever wondered what DJs do and how they do it (because you might want to do it too), check out this workshop!
We begin by discussing the basics of song structure and audio engineering most relevant to DJing. Next, we'll discuss some helpful concepts and common practices that will help your DJ sets flow. Finally, we'll show you how to work with FOSS DJ software Mixxx (mixxx.org) to prepare your music and perform it live.

	00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,319
uh

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,399
i just wanted to bring up this slide

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,240
again because it's mix

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,519
from mix.org if you'd like to get it and

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
try it out yourself

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
we're not going to be relying on any

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,200
additional hardware we're just going to

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,640
use your computer keyboard

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
so we're going to talk about what djing

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
is uh the minimum viable product of

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,160
music theory that you need

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,720
uh audio engineering concepts processing

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,359
your songs so you can get them ready

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,720
working on dj sets then doing it live

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,840
and then we'll talk about what's next

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,600
after you get through a lot of this

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,840
stuff

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
uh so sorry i have to say this right

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
before we get started

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
uh we are talking about art and there is

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
no right or wrong

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
um i'm just very opinionated so i'm

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
sharing my opinions but

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,520
yours are also correct at least for you

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
and that's what's important

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
and this is about showing you what works

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
for me so that hopefully if it works for

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
you

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,680
you can apply it and if you don't like

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
it at least you know exactly what not to

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,440
do

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,879
and save yourself some time uh

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,800
sorry if i'm talking quickly but i know

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,360
i'm very late so

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,479
what djing is and i mean djs are usually

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
late anyway

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,760
uh in its essential form it's playing

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
music

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
for you and yourself and your friends

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,000
that you all enjoy

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,439
if you've ever just picked out a spotify

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,159
playlist you're already a dj

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,720
now at its worst it's a really long

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,960
night

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
after a really long day and nobody

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,759
appreciates it

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,280
but at its best you're creating a

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
transformative experience

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
that your audience is going to love and

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
it's going to take them on a journey

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
and they'll remember that for the rest

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
of their lives and throughout an event

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
you'll probably

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
psych or cycle through all three of

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,759
those

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,159
uh what i think it shouldn't be just a

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
self-indulgent one-way conversation

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
that's just somebody going up there and

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,040
just playing whatever they want

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
without taking into consideration the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
people that are supposed to be listening

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040
and dancing to it

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
uh also the second point perhaps just

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
kind of

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
not representing yourself properly and

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,240
just playing music that you don't like

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,560
for people that you don't like that's

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,759
also not enjoyable

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,080
and lastly uh in any way

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,720
being dishonest just be yourself if

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,239
you're playing what you truly love

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,080
somebody out there will love it and it

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,319
will resonate with them and then they'll

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,959
appreciate your work

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,000
so enough philosophy more listening so

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,440
let's talk about

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,440
some of the minimal music theory that

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,400
you need we're gonna talk about

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,879
beats bars and phrases tempo matching

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,120
and then keys

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,080
so um in music a lot of the basic

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,440
dance music is grouped into bars of four

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,360
beats that's kind of the smallest

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,879
musical idea

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,680
but it's just an introduction a lot of

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,000
musical ideas have a sense of closure to

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
them

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
so you can have like one bar opening an

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,720
idea and another bar closing the idea

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,840
one two three four one two three four

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,560
now if you take a couple of those

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,519
and you take another pair of those then

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
you end up having

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,519
a 32 beat phrase this is

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,000
one of the uh best kind of chunks of

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,280
information to work with a 32-bit phrase

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,560
we'll use that soon

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,319
then we'll talk about tempo uh all your

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
music will have varying tempos

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,319
uh genres one of the things that makes

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
them a genre is that they usually stick

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,879
within certain tempo ranges

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,599
so let's say you got two songs the top

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,040
one is at 120 beats per minute

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,640
the bottom one is at 130. so the bottom

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
one is going through its musical

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,200
information

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,480
much faster than the first one uh in the

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,519
same amount of time

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,519
that second one will hit its uh

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,159
13th musical note or beat

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,040
by the time the first one is at its 12th

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,840
so you know

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,080
if you were to just hit play on both of

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,480
them they would be out of sync

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,519
so what are our solutions well you can

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,879
take that

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
second one that was at 130 and slow it

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,120
down to 120

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,640
or you could do the opposite take the

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,000
one that was 120

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,040
and speed it up to 130. so we'll show

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,520
you

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,000
the software here uh

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,199
this is where you get to adjust the

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,440
speed

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,840
of a song but we'll do that for reals

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
later

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,840
there you go

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,600
oh there we go uh all right

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,320
musical keys that's kind of a bigger

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,600
thing let's just talk about that later

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,840
uh if we have enough time so

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
enough numbers we're listening let's

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,360
talk about audio engineering like

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,440
volume equalizing and clipping

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
so volume is your primary tool when

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
you're mixing music

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
and you have multiple ways to control

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,639
volume

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,080
like at the very top of a mixer this is

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,000
a pioneer mixer

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,039
an actual hardware and you'll find

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
analogs of that in the software so those

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,199
little knobs at the very top

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
control the volume of each of the

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
channels

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,479
uh so you can kind of uh adjust a

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
permanent

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,840
kind of compensation of levels for one

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,560
song

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,440
compared to the other one then you got

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,919
your individual channel faders

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
those control the volume of the specific

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,639
song

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,639
and you could use it more of a as a

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,000
temporary compensation

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,880
of uh volume then you've got

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
your crossfader that lets you blend

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,240
between the two songs

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,080
back and forth and then you've also got

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,440
your main volume for everything

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,840
everything

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,280
so if we go back to the software

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,240
these are the gains like actually let me

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
show you walla's song

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
so if we were to play this one

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
you can set the stable compensation here

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,080
this is the volume

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,080
of that you still see it coming in but

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:49,840
there's nothing in the middle coming out

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:49,840
that's your mix and these are the eq's

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,120
forgetting that i have to do that

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,800
so i kind of jumped ahead of myself

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
because now we're going to talk about

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,440
equalizing we're focusing on that little

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,160
area of the mixer with the orange box

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,479
uh equalizing is volume control for

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,680
specific frequency ranges

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,319
so we've got three knobs there the high

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
knob

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,160
that controls uh things like the higher

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
frequencies

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,840
like uh percussion like

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
shakers and tambourines and also

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,680
sibilance

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,800
the letter s uh the mids control

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,879
a lot more of the musical information uh

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,520
like vocals and the low knob controls

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,400
lower things like the kick drum bass or

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,319
sub bass

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
that is a huge component of electronic

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
music

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,680
then you've got your filter at the very

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
very bottom

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,319
where if you move it counterclockwise it

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,400
removes the high end

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
and if you move it clockwise it removes

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,120
the low end

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
so let's go back to the software

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,000
this makes me want to check that

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,879
everybody can

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
see everything

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
well let's go back to the software

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
so let's do

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
this song i thought was pretty to listen

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
to

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,599
[Music]

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,839
so this is the high frequency we could

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,839
turn it

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,320
down

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,320
darken things up or brighten things

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:55,839
the mids you'll see you'll hear the

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,839
vocals drop up

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,669
and that kick drum should go away now

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,669
[Music]

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,839
and here's that filter

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,519
so

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,360
so moving on clipping is the harsh

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,760
distortion of audio when you just turn

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,640
it up

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,399
way too far it sounds terrible i'm not

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,160
going to do that to your ears

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,240
just know that it distorts sound

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,519
by just pushing it way too past the

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
limit

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,080
imagine if the sound was that little a

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,040
white dotted line

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,240
well digital auto has a limit so if you

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,560
go past that

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
it still has to represent it with that

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
black line

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
so what used to be nice and smooth is

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,080
now flat and harsh

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,880
it destroys your base so just don't do

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
it

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
keep your volume in the yellow avoid the

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
red

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,839
hitting the red every once in a while is

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,920
okay but not if you just have a lot of

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,959
steady red

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,200
so enough sides back to the songs

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,440
uh processing your songs here's where

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,279
you get to prepare your ingredients

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,000
you get to set quantitative things like

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,320
bpm markers and cue points

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,399
then you get to do qualitative things

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
like talking about genres energy and

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,440
other texts

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,959
so usually your bpm is automatically

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
detected

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,200
but it may be wrong so you got to tap it

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,040
out

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,240
and uh i'll show you how to do that as

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,959
well

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
and sometimes it could be correct but

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
the b

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,640
grid could be misaligned so you just

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,279
have to nudge it

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,640
here that uh drum beat right there at

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
the top

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,240
the red part is actually the kick drum

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
that would be the beginning

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,920
but the beat grid was detected a little

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,480
bit to the right

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
so all we had to do to fix that was

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
nudge it over

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
and get those clicks right where the

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,959
kick drum is at

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,160
so for example uh

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,600
let's go to this this is an example of

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,600
using playlists

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,480
which we'll cover later

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
so here we go

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
that's where we start

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:36,079
the thing is we would want

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,079
that little white line here so we can do

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,040
is do that and fix it this is really

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
important because all the other things

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,079
that you

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,880
want to do you need something stable

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
like that first

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
that looks way better that sounds way

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
better

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,560
now talking about markers cue points

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
each song is kind of like a little ear

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,920
movie there's an introduction

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,920
rising action a climax falling action

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,600
and a conclusion but that would make a

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,480
really short movie

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,560
or song sorry so a lot of times you

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
could just put two of those together

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,720
have a second set of rising action

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,279
climax and falling

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,639
with a little uh break in the middle

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,279
there

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,839
so we can set markers to map out a song

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,360
in all those sections and these are

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
common names that people assign to them

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
like an intro

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,279
a build the main body of a section a lot

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
of people call the drop

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,079
because of the anticipation leading up

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,160
to something and then getting a release

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,760
a drop of something a cathartic release

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,839
then you've got a breakdown another

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,519
build another drop

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
i put a question mark at that section

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
because i don't really know what to call

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,240
it but i like

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,079
knowing when there's going to be a drop

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
in energy sometimes you can mix into

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
that

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,800
and then you've got an ending and you

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,000
can set cue points to jump

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,680
to those songs in a section and navigate

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,639
your way around

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,000
so here's an example these are the cue

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
points i like to set

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,279
i like to set an intro the build and the

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,680
drop

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
the breakdown and those two other two

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
you may notice that i don't have them in

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,880
sequential order

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,920
because uh those buttons let you set

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,839
your cue points

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,079
and like in my hardware controller i

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,079
only have buttons one through four

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,800
so it's important for me to be able to

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,800
jump to like a four at the end

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
but i just wanna know that the breakdown

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,760
that number seven is coming up

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,360
anyway so you can also set loops

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
if you notice that little green

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
highlighted area you could just set up

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
an

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,680
end loop and then just take your time

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,320
mixing in your next song

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,639
and one tip i would give you is set

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
these markers after the bpm and grid

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
and try to be consistent with your

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,360
numbers like for me my number three is

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,880
always my first drop

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
so that whenever i bring up a song at my

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,440
headphones and i hit the number three

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,120
i can already hear the main body the

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
most important information of that song

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
then i'll worry about going back to the

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,000
intro and mixing it in

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,639
uh so now let's show you how to do this

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,880
in the software

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,880
so if we just hit play

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
we're going to call that the intro

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,560
number one

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,079
still in the intro

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
this should be a build and it's this is

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:58,050
also going to be a 32 beat phrase one

00:14:48,160 --> 00:15:01,120
two three

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,120
[Music]

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,839
and you would kind of do that for the

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,839
rest of your song

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,000
now let's talk about qualitative things

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,000
you're adding metadata i'm going to try

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,040
to use words that resonate with this

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,160
audience

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,720
uh so you've got genres which are just

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,480
labels that make sense to you uh you

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,759
might need to limit the ones that you

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
use though just you don't

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,480
uh overcrowd your information

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,399
i'll explain that in a moment uh also

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,399
talking about the energy of your songs i

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,440
recommend picking a small scale

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,040
to rate your songs uh a one to ten that

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
just sounds like two mr information

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,600
because

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,040
what's a seven compared to an eight um i

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,040
started off with one through four

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
and i ended up settling on a one through

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,880
five scale

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,240
just because uh i don't know that

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,560
felt smaller oh man

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,839
we're totally running out of time

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,160
working on dj sets

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:22,560
okay so let's say you have

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,720
all your music in

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,399
quick links these are all the songs that

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,000
i have

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,000
uh there we go

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,480
uh you can set a crate so that you have

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,560
a collection of songs let's say i'm

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,759
going to create a new crate

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,399
and i'm going to call it a

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,880
because i have a lot of songs that i've

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,000
described with the word day

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,160
hey joseph i just wanted to come in

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
and let you know that we have plenty of

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,600
time so feel free to

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
uh take your time okay there's a big

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,040
break between sessions

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:06,000
oh perfect okay cool all right cool

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:11,280
thank you so much thank you

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,400
so we can just right click here

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
and add to that crate

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,160
i really appreciate the sorting

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,039
functions within mix

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,160
so now if i go to create i have a sub

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
selection of songs here

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,559
i've also set up a few other ones that

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,200
we can kind of go and add things to

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,240
i'm going to clear this search because

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,520
if you're trying to improvise in the

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,600
middle of a set

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,720
just having to type things out you can

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,559
do a lot of this preparation beforehand

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
so let's see like i'm going to add this

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:51,520
song

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,520
to halftime drum and bass

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,440
oh yeah and you can see here that it's

00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,240
already in multiple crates

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,000
that's really nice

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,720
now you've got a crate of a whole kind

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
of genre

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:15,840
let's say i want to make a playlist

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,840
which would be

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
i covered the quick links which is that

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,600
huge uh

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,039
that bigger playlist of songs sorry

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,919
bigger list of songs let me not use the

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,840
word playlist

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,520
but we still need to filter so that's

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,200
when we talked about crates

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,360
which was an unordered collection of

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,640
songs

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,440
and then i recommend making those for

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,039
genres

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,720
moods or those common searches that you

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,799
would perform just so you make it easier

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,280
on yourself

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,840
now playlists here's where you get to

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:50,000
you get to make an ordered list of songs

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,000
and i recommend making those four events

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,840
so let's go back over to the software

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,840
let's make a playlist for today

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:11,840
go to all my music again and i told

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:14,720
myself to choose these three songs

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
lose yourself

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,840
and now in the dev conf playlist

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:41,919
i want to do that

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,880
so now we're talking about crafting sets

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
uh what what can you use to help guide

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,760
your decisions

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,600
well now when i got into the ecstatic

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,320
dance community

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,400
that's a community where people play

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
music to truly enjoy the music on its

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,720
own

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,520
it's not at a bar it's not so much at a

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,159
club

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,760
it's truly to be in a meditative state

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,679
while you get to explore dancing by

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,640
yourself or with others

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,480
i highly recommend those gabriel roth

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
invented a system called five rhythms

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,520
where she researched

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:19,039
lots of different music uh different um

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,320
cultures and she came up with kind of

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,159
five rhythms that help identify things

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,480
claiming that everything is energy moves

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,080
in waves patterns and rhythms

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,960
you've got flowing staccato chaos

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,520
lyrical and stillness what does that

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,240
mean

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,480
well if you tie them to emotions or life

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,760
stages or perception

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,520
uh you kind of start seeing that uh

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,039
she was able to describe them to let's

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,280
say like uh for me

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,559
the the most tangible one was kind of

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,080
the life stages

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,159
if you're talking about flowing

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,440
representing birth staccato

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,679
representing a building into childhood

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,360
chaos being puberty when you're

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,320
discovering yourself but also

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,400
uh clashing with others lyrical when

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,600
you're achieving a sense of maturity

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,919
and stillness when we reach death

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
well looking at all these different

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,640
descriptors

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,200
you can kind of see that with flowing

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
we're talking about opening

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
an opening kind of propelling forward

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,880
but it's still low energy

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,960
staccato represents something more

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,400
stable but

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,559
mid energy chaos is higher energy it's

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
wild

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:35,840
lyrical it's a release from the chaos

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,640
it's for lack of a better word pretty uh

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,840
and also mid or perhaps lower energy and

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,799
then you've got stillness

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,720
at the very end uh which it's also low

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,919
energy but it's got a closing feeling to

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,520
it

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,600
this should remind you of what we talked

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,799
about before

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,440
so the thing is the five rhythms says

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,520
that

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
they're they work in a circle you can

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,799
kind of go back and forth and move along

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,760
the circle

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,159
so if you take this and apply it to that

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,000
previous thing with the hill

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,240
you can kind of take a set over time

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,120
and navigate through that cycle on a

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
micro level

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,799
like all those little humps and also on

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
a macro level

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,720
for your you know hour and a half or two

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,159
three hour set

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
and build something where you start kind

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,360
of low you hit a little bump and then

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
you back off

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,679
you go back to let's say you start

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,760
flowing you go to staccato

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
you maybe hit on chaos a little bit and

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,080
then you back down

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,880
to staccato then maybe you go up to

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,559
chaos again

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,880
chaos again and then you push your

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,640
audience really far and then you release

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
and you go to lyrical you get pretty

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,600
again you lower the energy

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,039
then you can perhaps go back to chaos or

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
maybe go to stillness

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,720
run through flowing again and go to

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,360
staccato back and forth back and forth

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,159
so now let's talk about doing it live

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:02,080
let's talk about phrasing

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,760
um here's a representation of two songs

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
uh each of those little blocks is a

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,280
32-bit phrase

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,440
so we got two songs they're the same

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,120
structure it's just two mirror images

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,799
just to make it easy for us to talk

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
about uh layering them on top of each

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,799
other

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,720
so the thing about phrasing is not just

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
matching the beats

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,240
but actually matching the larger

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,919
information the larger patterns the

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,760
larger changes

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,080
try to line up your songs so that they

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,080
go through the changes at the same time

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,600
so you could do something where you have

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,320
the green song

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
stacking its intro where the blues song

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,000
starts fading out

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,000
on its musical information and then the

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,840
green one takes over

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,120
now you could do something where the

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,400
blue one kind of just

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,400
starts builds gets to the drop and as

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,600
soon as it hits the break

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,039
you layer the intro of the green song

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,880
so you can see you can you can kind of

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
touch this however you want

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
you've got an infinite amount of options

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,840
or you could do something like

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,520
do an intro build and a drop of one song

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,960
then an intro build and drop of another

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,600
one then another one

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
so basically you just get this this

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,240
dense

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,240
amount of musical information for a

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
while and then maybe you'll let

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,880
something go through a breakdown and

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,640
give your audience a break

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
or you could do something where let's

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640
say you have the blue song playing

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
and then when it hits its breakdown you

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,720
can tease in the information

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
from the green one just to give somebody

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,520
a sense of what's coming up

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,799
but then back off let the blue song keep

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,400
playing out

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,919
and then do that thing where you

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,200
introduce the green song

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,200
as the blue one is running out

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,840
i'm about to show you all this stuff in

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,440
the software this is just when it all

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,200
comes together

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,559
now you you can use subtract to be

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,080
queuing

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,240
to compete uh to

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,360
to turn down competing elements from the

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
music because if you're

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
mixing in two songs with let's say

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
vocals

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,240
and they're both singing things at the

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
same time

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
you can only have one lead singer really

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,720
so you might have to turn down the

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
volumes on one

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,039
or the other and also when you're

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,520
talking about bass

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
try to only have one bass line at a time

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
so you may want to just

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,760
turn down the bass on one while you're

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
what

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
of your new song while you're bringing

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,440
it in

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,559
then you also have your filter which is

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,080
like a power

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:31,200
eq um

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,400
you can use that to mix smoothly between

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,600
songs

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,080
by darkening out the end of one song

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,440
that's what i like to use it for

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
or if you start with it low you could

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,320
start with a song kind of muffled

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,600
but i don't do that too often the high

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
pass

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,000
you can fizzle a song away as you take

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,720
it

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,360
as you filter it out or you could start

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,679
off high

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,279
with just the percussion none of that

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,720
makes any sense because we're talking

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,520
about sound so i gotta show you

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,840
uh so let's say let's throw this song

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
here

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,840
and lose control all right so check this

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
one out

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
it's got drums

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:27,679
if i thin it out

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,679
i can play this song

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,840
gotta get the right temple

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,080
i'm gonna take down the base of the one

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,080
on the right

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:07,840
i'm going to get rid of the vocals from

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:07,840
the one on the left

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:18,840
i got a cute face chubby waist sick

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,840
[Music]

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,080
legs

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,480
so that's uh some of the options that

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,480
you have

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
uh reading a crowd this is a really

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,279
really tough thing

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,799
to try to work on nowhere near an expert

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,520
i think that's one of the challenges

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,840
that everybody works on all the time

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,559
again since you don't want your dj set

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,799
to just be

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,960
a one-way conversation where you're just

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,600
yelling at the audience

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,480
you want to see if you can play a song

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
and then

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,120
notice how it hits if people are liking

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,360
it or if they're not

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,559
so if they do if you're writing the

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,799
right moment in time

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,159
and everybody's loving it keep going

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,159
that direction

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,279
uh if you feel like you have to make a

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,320
change and then

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,919
you go that way and people aren't

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,520
receptive to it then perhaps make a

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,520
different change

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
so again just making it more of a

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,960
two-way conversation

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,720
instead of just somebody going up there

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,279
playing you know a list of songs that

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
they just

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,720
predetermined and it doesn't really

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
respond to the event

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,000
so what's next well you can mix and key

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,720
you could do back to back mixing with

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,520
other friends

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,080
or you could go into streaming so this

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,840
is a huge oversimplification

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,880
about mixing and key long story short

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,559
uh a musical key is the specific notes

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,840
that one said uh a song uses

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,760
so let's say we're just going to use the

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,200
keys on the bottom that's the key of c

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,960
major

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,720
if this doesn't make sense don't worry

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,679
if you just noticed i didn't do anything

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,360
about mixing a key

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,200
for the previous you know two songs

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,720
um some musical keys are related let's

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
say the key of c major

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,399
has these notes well there's also the

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,000
key of a minor

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,600
don't worry how we got that that's just

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,159
a minor

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,159
well if we just shift over c major you

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,799
see that they totally align

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,399
c to c d to d they have all the notes in

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,799
common

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,000
there are two other keys that also have

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,120
a lot of notes in common

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,600
with c major so you've got c major

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,600
a minor f major and g major

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,080
well okay so this is the camel wheel

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,279
that looks like a lot of information uh

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,159
well let's just

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,240
focus on the c the pink one at the top

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,520
in the middle there

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,520
what they did is that

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,159
we have a musical relation between the

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,640
other keys next to it

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,159
so remember we talked about c major

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,600
sharing notes with a minor

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:03,440
f and g or it's those two

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,559
just to the left and the right or inside

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,399
the same kind of color as that pink one

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,840
at the top

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,360
so long story short to make smooth moves

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,080
if you're playing a song that's in

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,279
c or let's not even worry about the

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,799
letters

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,559
one d if we

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,559
hold on to the d and we move over to

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,279
from 1d to 2d that's going to be a

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:33,120
smooth transition between two songs

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,720
if we're at 1d and we move to 1m

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,200
if we hold on to the same number but

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,039
just change between d and m

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,440
then we go from c major to a minor which

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,840
shares all the notes

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,279
so again since it's kind of confusing to

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,799
work with the real

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,039
key letters like a minor c major

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,880
they came up with these and this number

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,360
system to substitute that

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,919
so all you have to worry about either

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,679
moving with the same numbers

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:08,399
or plus or minus a number

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,880
with the same note sorry it's hard to

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,159
explain

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,559
why 1 and 12 are adjacent

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,120
but they are because there's 12 notes on

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
a keyboard

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,880
uh back to bag and tag teaming this is

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
where you get the share of stage with

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,519
your friends

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,360
um so you can kind of work things out so

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,480
let's say if it's two people playing

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,640
you could do three and three where

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,320
uh one person plays three songs then the

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,919
next person plays three songs and then

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,919
you go back and forth

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,679
uh what's pretty cool about that is that

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,000
it's intentional

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,120
uh imagine like volleyball somebody hits

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,480
the ball over the net

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,120
you get to pop it up set it and then try

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,360
to spike it

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,720
so you get to kind of receive what they

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,799
do

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,799
steer a little bit more and then try to

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,640
launch them in a direction

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,080
you can you can be malicious about that

00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,519
too

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,000
if you have a few people you could do

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,600
two and two it's a little bit faster

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,519
uh what they're probably doing on that

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
stage right there is probably one in one

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,559
where each person is playing one song if

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,919
it's

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,240
only two people it can get pretty

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,559
chaotic but it can be fun

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,360
and as a bonus i recommend playing each

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,399
other's music

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,000
uh sometimes we will swap uh

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,600
little usb keys so that hopefully your

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
friends organize their music in a good

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,480
way that makes sense to you

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,159
but it's really really fun to hear

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,080
somebody else play your music

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,760
in ways that you wouldn't because you

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,399
would never put those two songs together

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,559
but they did

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,039
because they didn't know better but hey

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,039
that's great

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,480
and lastly we talked about a lot of

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,480
stuff just don't forget to have fun

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,320
that's the most important thing if

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,440
people see you having fun with it

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,279
they will also enjoy it good music

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,080
while people aren't having fun with it

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,799
isn't good music

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,200
so that's it thank you for showing up to

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,960
my

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,080
very late talk

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,360
um we have a few questions for you uh

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,200
so let me see thank you i couldn't see

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,360
any of that so i appreciate it

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,679
yeah no i know i was figuring when you

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,039
were screen sharing it was hard to do

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,120
more than one at a time

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,399
i get it i completely get it i need

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
multiple monitors

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,080
i know right you sure do you sure do

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,760
especially for what you

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
what you're doing there okay so the

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,360
first question is from jerry

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,039
are there any disadvantages to using a

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,519
mixing software application

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,200
rather than a fancy physical sound board

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,679
apart from the lack of tactile

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
connection

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,600
so i've started focusing on

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,679
djing with a laptop because um

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,799
i like the ability to manage a large

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,679
playlist

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,000
um because i have a whole bunch of music

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,640
so

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,120
i wouldn't see many downsides to it i

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,880
guess it's just

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,399
actually yeah you know what i end up

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,760
using my eyes a lot

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,159
uh one thing that i want to start

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,720
focusing on is playing on cdjs where

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,399
it's just

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,080
uh essentially just you know a

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,559
controller with a little wheel on it

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,560
probably what you'd normally see uh

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,520
photos of djs with

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,919
um yeah that's the thing because there

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,280
you're

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,599
you're playing much more of an

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
instrument uh hopefully you know your

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,879
music better

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,720
you're relying much more on the

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,879
mechanics of it

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,720
um i'm kind of splitting the difference

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,040
i dj with a laptop

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,000
but then i have a hardware controller

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,320
because yeah

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,040
you can't you can't be actually grabbing

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,159
the eq

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,520
knob and and twisting it or

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,159
you know grabbing the crossfader and

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,440
actually doing that responding in time

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,960
because you need an instrument you need

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,960
a physical instrument to manipulate

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,879
properly

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,879
i hope that helps

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,760
i think it does um i think uh

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,440
great yeah jerry thank you jerry for

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,800
responding in chat

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,440
um all right our next question

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,960
so i'm going to skip over the first part

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,839
of this question so doesn't get recorded

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,720
but you can see in the q a

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,880
um so would you like to join omoisis in

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,800
the dev conf radio and plays some

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,920
songs at the end of the day to accompany

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,920
the mocktail session

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,680
uh sure

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,880
great all right so i'll let you i'll let

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,200
the both of you connect

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,800
after this session and figure out the

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,040
details of that

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,720
um and then i had a question for you so

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,640
i've been watching a lot of uh

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,560
music reddit sets lately and you were

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,200
talking a little bit about

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,240
that connection with the crowd um and i

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,440
am wondering

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,280
um what it feels like the difference

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,760
between doing what you just did

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,520
and then doing it in a crowd where there

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,839
are people like right in front of you

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,839
and how you manage that

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,920
unfortunately you just have to do it a

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,000
lot

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,599
i still get i mean i have stage fright

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,520
now so it's it's not a thing that

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,599
i think i've come to terms that i will

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,560
ever get over

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,920
i try to make that try to turn that into

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,359
a positive thinking that yeah then it

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,440
means a lot to me

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,560
um but really what made it easier

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,079
was starting off playing in my room then

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,800
starting to play in the living room with

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,240
friends over

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
and then starting to play at a very

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,320
small party where nobody really cares

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,240
and then getting to bigger and bigger

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,359
events so you kind of

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,079
slowly eke yourself forward

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,680
so that like i still have trouble djing

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,480
and holding a conversation with somebody

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,599
else

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,079
so kind of the more you start doing it i

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,599
guess

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,640
you slowly first you're looking at a

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,400
picture of a snake

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,240
then you're in the room with a snake in

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,040
the corner and then eventually you're

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,040
playing with the snake

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,920
fair enough okay let's see

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,280
a new question just came in while on

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,839
crowd versus virtual

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,359
is joseph into twitch i've noticed a

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,960
bunch of djs i've followed are doing

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,640
their gigs via twitch which is just

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,280
amazing and allows more people to join

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,280
and interact

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,320
twitch is amazing streaming is amazing i

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,000
meant to cover that

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
but that is a whole talk in itself

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,240
because exactly it gets very very techy

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
but it's amazing i mean you know the

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,400
pandemic hit and

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,720
nobody could go out and dance uh and

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,359
then

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,480
amazing shows started coming out where

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,680
you know then you're dancing in your

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,240
living room

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,680
so i think it's given people a great

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,680
opportunity to continue

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,720
sharing and continue sharing in a way

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,599
that's much more accessible to everybody

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,880
on both sides attendees and performers

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,760
themselves

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,040
so i haven't streamed too much that's a

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,280
thing that i want to get into i've

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,960
started buying more and more equipment

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,880
because you can make it really fancy

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,040
green screens

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,359
several camera angles people do

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,200
recommend getting a separate

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,480
computer for the streaming so you kind

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,359
of have your your music

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,240
computer or you know cdjs feed it to

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,000
something else

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,560
and then have that broadcast so you're

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,400
not taxing the one computer

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,160
with doing your audio and doing your

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,160
video and doing the streaming it's a lot

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,000
all right all right folks any other

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,000

thank you very much for sticking around

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,880

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,160
registered for the right thing

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,720
