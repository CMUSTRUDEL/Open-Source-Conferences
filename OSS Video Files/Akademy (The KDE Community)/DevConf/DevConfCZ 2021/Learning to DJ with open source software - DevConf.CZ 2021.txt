We begin by discussing the basics of song structure and audio engineering most relevant to DJing. Next, we'll discuss some helpful concepts and common practices that will help your DJ sets flow. Finally, we'll show you how to work with FOSS DJ software Mixxx (mixxx.org) to prepare your music and perform it live.
