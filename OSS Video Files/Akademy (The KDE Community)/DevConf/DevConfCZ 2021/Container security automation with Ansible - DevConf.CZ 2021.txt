Docker containers are the new way developers package applications. Due to the ease of use and deployment, more and more applications are getting deployed in containers for production use. With so many moving parts, it becomes imperative that we have the capability to continuously scan Docker containers for security issues. We will explore following points in our discussion:
- Understanding continuous security concepts
- Automating vulnerability assessments of Docker containers using Ansible
- Scheduled scans using Ansible Tower for Docker security
- Scheduled scans using Ansible Tower for operating systems and kernel security
- Scheduled scans for file integrity checks, host level monitoring using Ansible for various compliance initiatives
