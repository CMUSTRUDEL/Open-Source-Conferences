Description: 
	Speakers: Tomas Tomecek, Brian Stinson, Carl George

This is the place where you can try CentOS Stream. What’s that? It’s the latest development version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. You have a unique opportunity now since all the CentOS Stream developers will be present and can answer your questions.

This is not just a Q&A session, we’ll show you how to get CentOS Stream, what are all the delivery mechanisms, how to migrate from CentOS Linux 8 to CentOS Stream and may also peek behind the scenes how the distribution is being made.

We suggest downloading a VM image before the workshop to save time: https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/
