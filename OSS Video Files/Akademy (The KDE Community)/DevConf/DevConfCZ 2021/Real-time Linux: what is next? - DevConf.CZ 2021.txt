With the PREEMPT_RT mainlining, is the real-time Linux development ended? - No! It is the beginning of a new era. The low latency provided by the nowadays communication channels and the need for a software stack for AI/ML present on Linux is enabling a new class of cyber-physical systems that depends on real-time kernel. But, is the real-time kernel ready to be used in such scenarios? This presentation is a discussion about the current state of Real-time Linux. It will talk about the kind of determinism that is possible to obtain with Linux and the type of determinism that is still not possible to achieve. The main goal is to point to the next opportunities in the development that can enable Linux for a class of systems that requires more robust evidence of correctness, including the formal verification of the kernel and the mathematical analysis of the timing properties of the kernel.
