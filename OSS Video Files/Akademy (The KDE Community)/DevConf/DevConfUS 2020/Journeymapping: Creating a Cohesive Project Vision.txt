Title: Journeymapping: Creating a Cohesive Project Vision
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Sarahjane Clark & Kyle Walker

How to use an end-to-end flow to guide a project and the team to a shared vision.

In an open source project there will often be many different opinions on what problems the project should solve, where the users (who are often also the contributors) want to focus their time, and how to implement the solutions. Journeymapping can help identify the most important places to focus.

Using a successful open-source project we’ll demonstrate how the process works and how we were able to get all stakeholders to agree to a project plan and issues that focused on the end user. From interviews with stakeholders and subject matter experts, through the in-person workshop that went off the rails 5 minutes before we started, to the final assembly of the steps and feedback to the team, we’ll explain the journey and how you can implement it on your project.

creating a vision my name is kyle walker

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,639
i am an interaction designer at red hat

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
um i am i've been working in open source

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
um and software only for about the last

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,080
year when i

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,720
um joined red hat but i have been a

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,880
designer

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
in working on enterprise solutions and

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
hardware actually

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
for 15 plus years before that and i am

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,119
happy to connect

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,080
with anybody afterwards and my name is

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,800
sarah jane clark

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,719
and i go by sj i'm a user experience

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,040
researcher at red hat

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,800
and i've worked in the enterprise it

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,480
industry for pretty much my entire

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,480
career so i feel like i know the space

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,160
pretty well but i'm still learning

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
and i'm always on the lookout for good

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,239
study participants

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
so always recruiting and i'm a natural

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,960
born

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
ringleader which is why i was attracted

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
to this journey mapping project

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,640
so the goals for this presentation

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,920
first we want to help you

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,799
learn when to use a journey map how

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
it's best to implement this with a group

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
when to use this

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,799
as well and then making sure because if

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,159
you create this you need to also make

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,240
sure that you can share it with

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
everybody else so how to parse that data

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
and

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
come up with a plan to move forward from

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
there

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,680
and the exercise that we did and that we

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,960
will share with you was done in the

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
before times

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,880
back when we could be together in the

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
same room and obviously that's not going

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,159
to work these days

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
so throughout this presentation we're

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
going to give you some things to think

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
about

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
and to consider if you would like to do

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
this activity remotely so keep an eye

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
out for the zoom icon

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,880
for recommendations on how you might

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,880
conduct this online

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,640
so why did we need to do a design

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
exercise in the first place

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
what we uh we're working on as a team is

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
to redesign a tool

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
um this is a tool that we've been around

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,360
for about 10 years and we're redesigning

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,040
it's used to write and then to deploy

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,920
business processes um this tool was

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,920
taking a what was a one large

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,239
tool and breaking it up into different

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
sections

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,080
um to make it flexible to meet users

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
where they're where they are working

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
rather than making them work but this we

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,760
created different access points

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
and different parts of the processes as

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
you're going through and creating

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
what you need to create in this tool

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,120
which

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,040
led to what we were worried about anyway

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
being a disjointed and unclear

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
user experience so we need a design

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:51,840
exercise to make sure that we could

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,840
make it a cohesive project vision

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
so from there there was a vision for the

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
product

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
but it was developed by people with

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
different expertise

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,560
working in different areas so they were

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,920
looking for one complete vision

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
and to make sure users would have a

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,239
clear path to success so

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
being able to go from creating to

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
deploying

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,879
their processes um along with that

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
we had in our own ux team had

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
assumptions about

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,840
users um that were seem to be slightly

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,120
different from

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,360
those in the engineering team

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
and other stakeholders were mentioning

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
so i wanted to make sure everybody on

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
the team had a clear understanding

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
get everybody on the same page for what

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
terms we're using

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,799
for the users who we thought those users

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,959
were and what their capabilities were as

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
well

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,959
all right so once you have your goals

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,360
decided and your questions

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,040
decided now that's when you want to

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
select the method

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,200
and it kind of made sense to me that

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
what we were trying to discover was what

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,560
the workflow was

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,480
so it seemed like a journey map was a

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
good option for this

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,000
so a journey map is a visual

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,439
representation

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,840
of the process that a user goes through

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,599
the steps that a user does to accomplish

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,560
a particular goal

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,400
and a journey map can be as simple or as

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
elaborate as you want it to be

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,239
at minimum you need to document all the

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,440
steps

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
that the user is doing um what their

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
goal is

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
and you know keep track of what who the

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
persona is

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,600
you can layer any amount of information

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
that you want

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,720
on top of that anything that will help

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
you answer your question

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
so if it's important to know what the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
user is thinking or feeling

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
that's a layer you can add on if it's

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
important to

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,440
document the business processes that's

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,040
something else you could lay on really

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
the sky is the limit

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
think about whatever you need to know

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,600
that will help you

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
reach your goals in terms of whether

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
this is a good

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,199
option for a group exercise there's a

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,639
few things i would encourage you to

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,039
think through

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,199
so first this is not a good exercise

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,080
for a group that doesn't get along very

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,080
well

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,160
it's a very collaborative exercise and

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
there's a lot of discussion and back and

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
forth

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,080
so if the team doesn't get along well or

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,919
is kind of shy this is not a good option

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,840
um if you need to um

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,759
work with folks that you don't know or

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,440
who don't know the topic very well this

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
is going to be difficult for them to

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,240
contribute so you need folks

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
who really know the space or at least

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
have a

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,919
good enough understanding that they can

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,080
feel like they're participating in the

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,560
exercise and be part of the discussion

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,240
as far as doing this online there's some

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,039
tools later on that we will

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,440
recommend that you can use to help

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,440
collaborate when we did this in person

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,960
it was in a conference room with lots of

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,120
white boards and

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
sticky notes and sharpies but there are

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
tools available that will

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,319
approximate that experience online we'll

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,479
share those later

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
so once you have an idea of what you're

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,680
doing you obviously need to identify

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,759
your participants

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
so what we started with was identifying

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
those stakeholders

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
and smes or subject matter experts

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
these are people within the community

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,080
that are familiar with the content

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,360
and have a stake in how the design will

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
turn out so that's

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
engineers architects um users if that's

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
at all possible

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,440
that would be helpful could be helpful

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,199
as well um

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
so once we started to identify those

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,080
people we wanted to

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,639
interview them ahead of time or at least

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,759
some subset of them ahead of time

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
um just to get an idea of what they're

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
thinking

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,759
um kind of get us get ourselves a

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,639
baseline of

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,520
where this whole process might start and

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
have an understanding

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,440
for ourselves of what their vision of

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,039
this process is

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
and this also helps to populate some of

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,400
the stickies some of the ideas ahead of

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,479
time that you might want to put in there

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
while we're doing that interviewing we

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
wanted to make sure we were asking

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,520
consistent questions between

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,759
the different participants to

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,680
this helps to make sure that you're

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,880
getting roughly the same answers or at

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
least the people are answering the same

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
questions

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,759
which can help you again get that

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
general understanding and have that

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
baseline

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,440
if you're going to ask everybody a

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,720
different question then you might get

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
different answers and

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
you put them if you plot them on the

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,639
same place they're going to be it could

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
be wildly different

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,360
so when you're planning the workshop um

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
you want to send an agenda of course

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
it's important to let folks know how

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,879
they're going to spend their time

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,039
but i think it's also important to

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
briefly explain the exercise that you're

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
going to do

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,000
um you know this is kind of a design

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,199
exercise and designers are probably used

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,360
to working this way

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,960
but other folks who might be attending

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
may not be so familiar

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,199
and might be more comfortable if they

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,120
knew how the exercise was going to go so

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
just give a little explanation

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,639
uh send a link to a blog post or some

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
photos just something to

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
help them become familiar with the

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,120
exercise

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,879
also invite the group to contribute

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,199
additional questions

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,479
so as kyle said as you're working

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
through

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
the interviews and discussing with folks

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,240
what they want to know some questions

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,440
may come up later so just give them the

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
opportunity

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,440
to contribute those questions so you can

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
adjust your exercise if you need to

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,080
definitely feel free and prepare to go

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,640
off script

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
so the best laid plans you know they can

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,839
go off the rails very quickly

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,120
and you'll see later on i'll give you an

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,040
example of how that

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
exact thing happens so it's really

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,880
important to

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
know that this can happen and know that

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
it's not a problem

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,120
we are not coming together to create the

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,160
perfect journey map we're here to answer

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,760
questions so if you can be flexible and

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,440
kind of go where the discussion

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,200
takes you that's where the really

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,320
interesting ideas

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,480
and and creation comes to life is in

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,279
those conversations so

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
in advance kind of take a look at your

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,200
schedule

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,160
and just prepare yourself mentally for

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,160
how much time

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,000
you're willing to allow this

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,320
conversation to go on before you kind of

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,600
have to gently nudge people back

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
to the topic at hand you want a good

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,640
balance between the time that you have

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
available

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
and letting this free flow conversation

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
happen

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,279
and i'm always going to encourage you to

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,519
test your logistics in advance

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,880
particularly if you're using online

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
tools

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,680
to do this exercise so if you're using

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
zoom if you're using online white boards

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
get two or three of your friends

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
together and test that out because

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,839
on the day of that's not when you want

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,480
to be trying these things out and

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:06,480
finding it didn't work as expected so

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,640
speaking of the day of so we started the

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
meeting um we

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
uh ahead of time we wanted to present

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
the plan which is before lunch and then

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,399
after lunch we're going to do the

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
exercise

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
so we started presenting the plan

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
talking about what

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
um you know the questions that we had

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,040
asked in the interviews

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
and the answers and what we had come up

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,000
with based on that

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,680
as we're presenting this uh we were told

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,079
that what we thought the flow was and

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,399
what we thought our exercise was was

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
wrong the steps were not right the

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,120
people were not right

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,839
and so it was

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,360
kind of a oh okay that's a big deal

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
um so also along in this meeting there

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
was

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,160
discussions around the technical

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,959
savviness of the different personas so

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,079
um we discovered that you know as i

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,800
mentioned in the beginning

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
we had ideas of we wanted to make sure

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,920
that we in ux

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
understood and had the same feeling

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,360
about who the users were

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,720
as those on the engineering team and the

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,640
architects

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,480
what we found out during this meeting

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
when we were having a discussion is that

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,160
not only did we maybe not have the same

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,680
understanding between ux and engineering

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
but people within engineering didn't

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
have the same understanding of who the

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,720
users were

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,560
so this became a much larger question

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
and a much more important question to

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,480
answer

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,440
during this exercise um

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
so you know as a result of all this it

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
was

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,640
really helpful that we had our goals

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,640
ahead of time

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
um because they allowed us to be

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,079
flexible and to figure out different

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
ways that we could still get to those

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,160
goals because we still needed to

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
understand

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
who the users were and we still needed

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
to have an end-to-end flow and

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,160
understand

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
how users are going to use this product

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
or project

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,000
from start to finish as well so those

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
two goals still allowed us to

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,079
have a little bit of flexibility in what

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
we were doing

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,839
so to address this kind of

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,880
misunderstanding or

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,079
misalignment on the personas

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,680
the design team gathered over lunch and

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,160
we put our heads together while we were

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,959
eating sandwiches and salads and

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,120
everything

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,839
to figure out how we could address this

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,200
issue because it did seem to

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,360
prevent us from moving forward

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,959
this was a long-standing issue with the

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
team um

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,200
just to be clear this is not an issue

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
that came up during this workshop it

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,800
just

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,639
kind of surfaced during the workshop as

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,720
an issue that just it would

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,440
not allow us to do the exercise as we

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
intended

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
and we would not have come out with

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,880
anything productive at the end so we

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,959
really needed to figure out a way

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,760
to address this problem so

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,560
as we're eating lunch we decide to more

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,440
or less fundamentally change

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,600
the workshop exercise to help us get to

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,800
the bottom of the situation

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,079
and what we decided to do was as we were

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
mapping out

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,240
the workflow so mapping out the steps we

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,399
were going to have

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,760
the workshop participants decide

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:24,320
or identify which persona they felt

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:27,200
was doing the task at the time so

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,600
this is kind of putting design could

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
have decided

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
you know this is we think this persona

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
is doing this task but we wanted to put

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,000
it back on the workshop attendees

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,360
to have them say who they thought it was

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,399
and hopefully

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,600
we would see patterns and ways where

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,839
they

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,760
diverged and that would help us figure

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,600
out where the root of the issue was

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,959
and to create some discussion around

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
that we wanted to

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,040
have folks talk about why they thought a

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,040
business analyst was doing

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,680
this task and why some other folks

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,440
thought a developer was doing this task

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,639
why is that different let's talk about

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,600
it so when we went back in

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,839
to the session we told the workshop

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
attendees that we were adjusting this

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,959
and everybody was on board it added a

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,839
little more work

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,199
to the exercise but you'll see um it

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,760
definitely paid off to kind of do that

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,279
in the moment shift it was a little

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,639
nerve-wracking i won't lie

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,279
at the time to do that but um as kyle

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
said if you

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,399
have solid goals and you have planned

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,959
ahead for a little bit of flexibility

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,199
we were able to adapt very well i

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,199
thought

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,279
so in the workshop again this was uh

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,959
in the before times before covid so we

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,440
were able to be together

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,440
and we were in a conference room

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,120
together with lots of stickies lots of

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
sharpies

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
so we wanted to make sure that everybody

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,839
got a pad of sticky notes and some

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,000
sharpies this is an inclusive exercise

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,720
and we want to encourage everybody to

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,720
participate

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,839
if you see some folks who are maybe kind

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
of shy or don't know how to get started

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,240
encourage them a little bit maybe talk

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,160
to them to get some ideas flowing but

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,279
don't force it

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
you don't want to make anybody

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,720
uncomfortable but maybe once they see

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
some folks starting to put their ideas

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
on the board they might get into the

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
flow of it

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,240
i would also encourage you to write your

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
own stickies and your own ideas and put

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,720
them on the board as well

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,759
even if you had intended to just be the

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,519
moderator

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,000
if you know the space and you know the

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,800
domain add your ideas that can also

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,040
encourage other folks to participate or

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,279
to question or to create some discussion

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,199
as you see some of these ideas and

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,199
sticky notes being added to the board

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,000
you may want to get some clarification

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,639
from them you might say things like hey

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,399
this is

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,079
this is an interesting idea can you tell

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,560
me a little bit more about it

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,199
you know get to the clarity gl get to

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,199
the uh

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,440
the real understanding of the sticky

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
note um so you know it's a small piece

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
of paper it's a three inch by three inch

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,600
piece of paper so it's hard to put big

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
ideas

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,839
and if you need to write out other

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,959
sticky notes to clarify that's great

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,120
but clarity is uh the goal of the

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
exercise

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
and you definitely want to do active

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,120
listening so

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,639
you want to say i think i heard you say

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,199
and kind of repeat back

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,959
and give the person the opportunity to

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,480
kind of refine what they said or to

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,279
expand on what they said

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,759
this is definitely an ongoing exercise

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,040
where

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,880
there's a lot of back and forth and

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,560
discussion and collaboration

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,600
so definitely prepare to to listen

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,839
and participate in the conversation

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,720
uh if you're doing this online we've

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,959
linked a couple

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,920
of whiteboard options here which is a

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,079
good way

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
of approximating the experience of being

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
in the room together

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,839
and it lets everybody um log in and

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,839
contribute together to the same board

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,199
so after the exercise is

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,959
done everybody has added their sticky

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,240
notes you see a lot of sticky notes here

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
this was a

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
a really good exercise everybody

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,079
contributed

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,960
this is when you want to go through and

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,200
kind of expand on some of these ideas

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,000
so as a moderator you can go to the

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
board

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,440
and kind of read them through you'll

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,720
want to start arranging them

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
into themes so if you see sticky notes

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,320
that are

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,679
very similar or related you can start

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
rearranging them and putting them

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,039
together

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,200
be careful not to move them out of the

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,240
category that they are in but start to

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
group them within

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
the same category and this is also where

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,640
you want to

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,480
you know ask those clarifying questions

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,360
you know read it out loud say

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,919
i think i understand this to say and say

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,600
what you think it is and invite whoever

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,000
uh wrote it to add to it or to expand on

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
it

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,520
now you don't want to call folks out

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
specifically you don't want to say hey

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
john

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
this looks like your handwriting you

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,039
want to tell me what you were thinking

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,640
just read it out loud and if somebody

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,440
wants to identify themselves as the

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,440
author

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
they'll speak up they'll talk about it

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,760
and if not then you're you've opened it

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,600
up

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,559
to the group for conversation for

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,799
general conversation

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,559
um and then this is also where the

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,559
discussion happens

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,880
so this is another thing to keep an eye

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,200
out for as a moderator

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
um in this particular group we had

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
talked earlier about

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
how there was some you know misalignment

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
and disagreement about who the actor was

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,880
who the persona

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,600
was um for these sorts of things so

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,600
encourage the discussion but keep an eye

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,440
out too for when it starts to go down

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,400
the rabbit hole you don't want this to

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,559
become

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,320
um you know a big spiral downwards

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,240
let it go for a minute or two keep an

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,440
eye out and then gently bring people

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,520
back to the topic if you need to

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,720
as you see here we broke out the map

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
into two rows so the first row the top

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,120
row here

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,960
is the developer and the bottom whoops

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,000
gosh my bad and the bottom row

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,840
is the uh business unit user and these

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
were the two personas that we wanted to

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,720
track

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
and as you can see here there were

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,720
sticky notes in both of these rows and

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,600
it really helped us to

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
clarify who the actor was and it really

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,400
helped the group

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:52,799
as a whole kind of a line on

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:55,360
who is doing what and when

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,240
all right so once we have the exercise

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
really

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,320
it was a lot of fun it was really good

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,480
we had some really great discussions in

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
that exercise

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,200
after that we need to move forward we

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,440
need to get somewhere else from that

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
um there it does no good to do this

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,559
exercise and then just

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
have it be done like yeah everybody had

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,240
fun we need to

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,159
take that those insights and then create

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
a plan going forward so

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
that's what this part is so we started

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
by

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,600
one to two days later after we've all

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,080
had a chance to decompress

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,200
um start by reviewing everything within

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,559
the ux team

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,559
so this is looking at all the stickies

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,919
writing them down under making sure we

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,440
all have a shared understanding within

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,280
our own ux team

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,360
of what they all meant um

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
the conclusions from the exercise as

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,120
well and then

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,280
taking those stickies taking those ideas

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,520
and putting them on a whiteboard again

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,400
obviously this is kind of you know the

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,679
before times

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,000
ssj said so we did it in person

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,200
in a conference room um but you can use

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
one of those other whiteboarding

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,679
techniques

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,720
programs to do this virtually as well

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,720
but so this is taking

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,000
everything putting it on the board

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
connecting dots where

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,039
where does this one process connect to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,559
this other

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,559
section um and drawing those arrows

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,360
all over the place um as you can see in

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,159
that that picture of the whiteboard

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,799
so you want to then once you have that

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,400
drawn

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,000
you need to be able to communicate this

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,720
back to the team

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,400
um so picking the tool that is going to

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,000
be able to show this flow that we

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,679
identified with this journey mapping

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
exercise

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,000
um using that we in this case we used a

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
workflow tool

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
um so you can see all of the places of

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,799
the entry points

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,240
all of the exit points where

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
you know where the arrows connect is

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
where it's an easy transition or an

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
understandable transition to get from

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,320
one place to another

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,840
if the arrows don't connect then oh wait

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,280
we have a problem we need to

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,919
figure out we need to help the user

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,960
understand where to go next

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
so using different colors and graphics

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
to represent the different sections of

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,120
the work through

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,120
so we have those each of the different

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,200
sections in the journey mapping exercise

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,919
so we can show those different sections

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,840
by using color in this case and then

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,080
using graphics to represent the users to

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,480
make little pictures of

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,600
which representing the different types

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,440
of users

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,120
that are using this this project

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
um using those together to kind of

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,679
create this cohesive vision you can see

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,039
that

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,679
um down on the bottom left and this is

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,360
creating the graphics that help explain

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
what we went through in this exercise

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,000
what the user is going to go through

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
while they're creating this

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,440
and once we have that map that we drew

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,200
that we now have a shared understanding

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,880
in ux we

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
reviewed it with a couple of

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,520
stakeholders not with everybody at first

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,039
um some of the the stakeholders that we

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,360
identified in the meeting and

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,320
in the interviews as is having a more

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,520
active role

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,559
in helping to guide where the program

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,200
goes and having the

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
clear ideas where they thought things

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,039
were so we identified we

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,640
worked with them we showed them okay

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,960
here's where we think the gaps are

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,880
they said okay we didn't see that gap or

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,240
we had an idea for that already so we

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,520
added that in notes

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,200
to add more depth to that map

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,320
and then once we have that discussion

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
and where we had gone through that and

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,280
understood where

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,960
we thought their understanding was what

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,120
we thought the understanding should be

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,600
from a user perspective

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
then we presented the whole full flow

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
back to

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,240
the team we had a meeting with everybody

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,120
that was in the journey mapping exercise

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,799
and we presented the full plan so from

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,200
this we were able to

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,559
identify the gaps in the process making

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,799
sure that users could get from one

00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,480
section to another

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:03,360
excuse me we sorry

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
using those gaps we created issues so

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,320
that we can track

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,960
and focus on developing solutions for

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
those and making sure that we can create

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,640
that

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,200
easy understanding for the user and

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,840
to this day the team actually still goes

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,080
back and references this

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,080
happened heaven eight months ago now

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,279
um the team is still referencing this

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,240
periodically to

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,720
to show what the vision is for this

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,120
product

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,760
and where we need to focus and where the

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,640
team needs to focus

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,640
to create the best vision going forward

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,120
so takeaways from all of this um

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,320
you need to have that well-defined goal

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,919
at the beginning before you start

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,520
anything making sure you understand what

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,640
you're trying to create

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,279
what you're you're trying to get at from

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,760
doing the exercise or from doing

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,880
all of this designing in the first place

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,720
and then

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,559
also being able to map out the

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
information that will help you reach

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,840
that goal

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
so you're trying to understand once you

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,200
know what your goal is you need to

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,360
then you can understand what information

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,120
you need to gather in order to get that

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,120
goal and use this exercise to do that

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,760
and in your workshop you want to or

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,640
before your workshop you want to prepare

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,279
and have that plan be ready to go things

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
happen

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,320
you know humans are humans and you want

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,919
to be ready to shift if you need to

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,919
during the discussion and during the

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,480
workshop as the moderator

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,520
listen for cues that things need to get

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
a little clearer

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,720
or need to have a little more discussion

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,559
um

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,080
you'll know what those sound like when

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,720
you hear folks

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
asking questions or even worse if

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
they're

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,159
they're silent when there's some

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,840
discussion going on this should be

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,960
collaborative so keep an ear out for

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,760
these things

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,559
um that need a little more work and

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
finally

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,159
doing this as a group whether it's in

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,720
person or online

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
can help create empathy for the users

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,000
which is always important

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,159
but also for parts of the flow the

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,720
workflow that they may not otherwise see

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,159
or interact with you know when we work

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,919
on product teams

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,279
sometimes you just work on your little

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,200
piece of it and you never really think

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,039
about what it's like to work with these

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,440
things from end to end

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,919
so this sort of exercise helps expose

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,720
folks to what it's like to do the entire

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,080
flow

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,240
um which is always great for creating

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,200
empathy and creating those connections

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,200
between folks

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360

hello hey there thank you for the

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,080
amazing talk

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,080
well thank you

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,080
it's fun now it's fun to go back through

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,960
that

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,360
and think about all the things that we

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
had done

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,840
really you know at the time when you're

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,440
doing it you think okay well

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,120
you know that was that was good work but

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,960
when you start laying it out and all the

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,039
stuff that we accomplished

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,679
um it was really it was an interesting

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,520
story to kind of think back through

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,880
well i want to confess i've never done

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,159
journey mapping

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,279
uh and i'm very new to ux but this was

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,480
really amazing like

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,520
it was very clear for even a newcomer

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,880
so thanks for that great

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,399
great glad to hear it

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
it was definitely my first time doing

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,799
journey mapping as a group

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,480
i've certainly done it myself or maybe

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,640
with one other person

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,840
to kind of understand you know a

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,120
workflow or

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,080
you know um essentially whatever a user

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,480
is going through

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,559
as they're passing through an experience

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,279
but doing it as a group that was

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,919
that was new to me and you know it

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,480
worked out

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,440
it worked out yeah it was a very dynamic

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,840
group at that too

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,279
so that's amazing i i wanted to ask how

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,600
did you

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,320
folks decide on this topic is this

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,080
something

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,399
you uh work on in your day-to-day jobs

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
or

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,360
did you just how did you come up with

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
this idea

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,399
um i mean i i wanted to give a talk at

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,039
deaf conflict was one of my

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,440
you know goals for day here honestly um

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,360
and i

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,200
kind of went along what did i do in the

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,919
last year what could i

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,880
um talk about and then i remembered you

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,960
know we did this

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,159
um sjni and a couple other people on

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,760
their team and i just

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,679
thought hey maybe that's a good story

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,440
because it's got the you know the

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
everything changes yeah the plot twist

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,159
in the middle is what sold it for me

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,200
yeah

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,640
uh well that's amazing you know we

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,919
we may have undersold it a little bit

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,360
but it was a very panicked moment

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,360
to try to be you know eating a sandwich

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,279
and on the fly really coming up with a

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,279
way to

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,679
answer a question that just so

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,080
fundamentally blocked us

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,360
just we you know we had this day to get

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,919
this one day

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,880
together and if we couldn't figure out a

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,559
way around

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,520
this one thing the whole rest of the day

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,520
was going to be a waste

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,760
so it was just it was a very high

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,480
pressure moment and very memorable

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,200
so for me that was the real the real

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,480
story that

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,440
i wanted to share yeah for me it was the

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,120
first time i met

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,480
pretty much everybody in the room um wow

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,399
it was i was i was at red hat for

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,760
six months at that point but i just you

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,080
know i talked to some people

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,799
you know on the phone but that was about

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,039
it so

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,399
wow thank you for sharing experiences i

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,159
think um

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,600
talks which come from like real

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,000
experiences

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,159
um are the best i guess uh more than

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,720
theories more than concepts i i find

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,720
these

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:25,760
to be most interesting yeah i agree

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,480
i'm glad you found it useful

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,679
thanks thank you i don't see any

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,679
questions in the chat

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:39,279
maybe everybody's got everything

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
and they certainly have our contact info

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,840
if something

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,760
comes up for them later yeah

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,880
absolutely i'll also post a link to the

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,279
breakout room

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
here in the chat so if anybody wants to

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,880
catch

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,440
