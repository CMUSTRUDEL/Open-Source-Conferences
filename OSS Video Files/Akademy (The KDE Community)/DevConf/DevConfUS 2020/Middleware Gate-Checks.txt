Description: 
	Speaker: Aneri Shah

My talk is based on Middleware Productizationâ€™s Gates Initiative. It becomes necessary to verify
that our Product is following the required Standards and policies decided by Red-Hat. This is
where Gates-Check come on board. These Gates consist of different checks that need to be
applied before, during or after the Productization Process to verify the compliance with the Red
Hat Policies and Standards. They are mandatory to prevent Red Hat from being vulnerable to any
of the legal actions or government sanctions. So, in my talk I will be presenting the idea of -
What exactly are these Gate-Checks?
Why and when are they required to be applied to the Products?
How to run these Gates Pipeline?
