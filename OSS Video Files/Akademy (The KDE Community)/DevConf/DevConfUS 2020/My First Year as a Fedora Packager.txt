Title: My First Year as a Fedora Packager
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: David Duncan

Have you wondered about what the experience was like for a new packager? This is a talk for you. You might already know what it's like to package software, but you may not realize how your actions affect new maintainers who don't yet have a strong community voice. Join me for a detailed review of my experience as a first time software packager and the community experience associated with building and maintaining packages for Fedora.

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,920
hello uh welcome to uh

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
my talk here at dev conf us 2020.

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
uh my name is david duncan and i'm going

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,920
to talk to you today about

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,920
my first year as a fedora package

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
manager

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,720
now um

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159
it's the end of my first year and i

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
still feel like i haven't gotten

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,920
anything done

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,040
that really makes me feel like i've

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,840
become more advanced

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
i'm perfectly willing to try packaging

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
on pretty much anything that you bring

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,200
to me

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,159
and to do the work that's necessary to

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,520
get the help that i need

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,960
and when i decided to do this i was

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,680
at a fedora flock in budapest

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
and i was talking with some of the

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,759
people there and

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,360
and i was super excited about the idea

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,159
of getting more involved with

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,040
fedora in the fedora engineering side

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,640
specifically

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,640
so that i could one grow my skills and

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,280
to

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,320
be a beneficial member of the fedora

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,360
community

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,520
uh outside of just being an you know an

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,200
evangelist

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
and letting people know that i was

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
excited to have

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,239
fedora on my own desktop and my own

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,560
cloud systems

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,200
so what did i sign up for i was talking

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,599
to kevin fenzie and kevin said that he

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,599
had

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,319
uh rolled his own version of the aws cli

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,599
package

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,800
and uh he well it was derivative of

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,959
someone else isn't it

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
but he was working on it and and it was

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
it was something that he was keeping up

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
uh updated so that he could use it and

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
he said that

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
i'd really like to have some you know

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,720
like to have it off his plate

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
and uh this my ears picked up because i

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,480
work at amazon and

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
and uh i said you know this this would

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,879
be great i

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,720
i have uh other um

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,640
high visibility requirements around

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,840
leveraging the aws cli

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,959
in the fencing agent and uh

00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,239
would love to um you know to

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,040
to bring that into into line and so i

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,360
was

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,280
envisioning this this space where i'd

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
already had a lot of the groundwork laid

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,239
by a

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
uh by a senior member of the engineering

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,280
staff

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,280
and um and would be able to

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,840
uh sort of guide this through in

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
in our uh in this part in the process

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,239
and learn a lot more about packaging

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
um super excited about packaging and

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,400
that was a that was something that was

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,920
a big deal so um

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
so with kevin's help i set out to become

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,040
the

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:42,400
the packager for aws cli

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,560
um now

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
this is my first package and so i looked

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
at it and i thought this is something i

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,319
depend on

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,080
and it's something that i that is an

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
important part of my daily work

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,319
schedule so it's something i felt like i

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
could i could really

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
get a much better understanding of very

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,159
quickly i wouldn't have to worry about

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,159
too much about um

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
what like what i had to do or how this

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
how how it worked

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,040
or where the um where the developers sat

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
because i know that they sat

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,359
sort of in the same company that i was

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,600
sitting in and that we would be able to

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,160
um have a close communication or i'd be

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
able to

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
you know reach out and bend their ear

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,280
and in short order

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
but what i didn't realize when you know

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
when kevin handed this over he said oh

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
yeah this is kind of in lockstep with

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,880
the

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,320
boto core and so i should probably just

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,520
give that to you too

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,160
so one package became two packages

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,360
because you couldn't update the aws cli

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,759
without also updating uh the boto core

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,560
package that it depended upon

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
so now i had two packages that uh that i

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
was

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
i was working with and and that was a

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
great place to start

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,639
i felt like i had this this uh kind of

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,240
understanding of

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,960
of um how the overall i was you know

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,199
had sort of a microcosm of the ecosystem

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,360
where everything fits together and we

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,400
understand each other so here i have

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
this very

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,600
simple sort of controlled environment

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,479
and i thought that was super exciting

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
so getting started um the first thing

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
that

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,759
was important was finding a sponsor uh

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
you can't just jump on the

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
the packaging mailing list and and say

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,160
hey i'm just gonna

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,120
i'm just gonna package this guy okay

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,360
um you you uh you need to make sure that

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,320
everybody understands that you're

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,600
um you're interested in packaging and

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,880
you want to be a part of the

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,160
part of the fedora community that's

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,280
doing that work and um

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,520
and they will provide you someone

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,039
someone in the in the devil world will

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,160
will uh

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,280
um sponsor you for your um

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,080
for your participation and

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,440
um usually that's someone who's

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,039
interested in helping you

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
to get a little bit better at what

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,600
you're doing um

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
so that's so they become and i would

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,039
encourage you as someone who's looking

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
into packaging or thinking about

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
packaging to think about this as uh as

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,919
someone who's an important member of

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,120
your team

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,000
your your goals your responsibilities

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
are uh something that they're they're

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,560
saying that they will

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
uh take some degree of responsibility

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,639
for i mean not

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
not in a in a way that you know any of

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,960
us are in

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
super trouble but in a way that makes

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,680
sure that we we are

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,280
getting what we need to to get our work

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,600
done and so that means

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:47,039
someone who can uh can really help you

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
so choose carefully in my case

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,280
i did i feel like i did choose carefully

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,680
i had someone who was encouraging and

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,479
part of the fedora engineering team and

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
and had been doing this for uh a number

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
of years

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,039
but also was successful beyond the years

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
that he was

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,599
that he had been packaging so it was a

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
an opportunity for me to learn from

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,080
someone who

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,000
um really groked a lot of the

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,160
the component parts in ways that

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,400
helped to build a bigger understanding

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,160
of the ecosystem

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,319
and then so you know you'll learn a lot

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
you'll be amazed at what what tools are

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
available to you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
uh you'll see some of the things that

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,880
you know that sort of behind the curtain

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,440
in ways that yeah you didn't see before

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,800
uh how the builds are done and how your

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,400
how the reporting tools

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
uh talk back to you um but then at a

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,599
certain point

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,319
you know the focus comes off of your

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,440
sponsor

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,840
and your sponsor kind of leaves you

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
um to grow on your own and that's that's

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,639
an important part of the growth period

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,280
i'm not saying that they're just

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,879
just abandoning you but but to say that

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,319
they're giving you an opportunity

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,319
to to seek out and and apply

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
understanding as you as you see fit

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
and this is an opportunity for you to

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,400
engage with the

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,599
um with the community overall

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,840
and i encourage you to be

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,680
transparent about what your abilities

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
are because there are lots of people out

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
there in

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,759
in the community who are willing to help

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,879
you and

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,000
um and i think that it's important that

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,200
that we as members of this community

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,680
go on helping each other to be

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
at our most vulnerable and to learn as

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,959
much as we possibly can

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,320
in as safe an environment as we can

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,919
create

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,120
so i'm challenging you to

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,279
be a part of that and make yourself uh

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,160
you know extend yourself out to the edge

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,160
of your understanding

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
so yeah the first experiences that i had

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
around packaging

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,560
happened in in a rapid fashion

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,160
i was not expecting to take on one i

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
wasn't expecting to take on two packages

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
but when i did i thought yeah that'll be

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,120
good and

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
i'll get a gain a better understanding

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,080
of the ecosystem

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,920
and uh two that that meant that uh

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
i i would be able to take this

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,480
opportunity to

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,040
um to understand more about uh

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,839
that microcosm that i that i was

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,240
participating in

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,360
um and so uh

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,560
very fast very quickly the

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
my chosen applications were starting to

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,800
reach out

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,720
into other requirements right and

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,560
so i looked to the documentation

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,160
specifically the package guidelines that

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,000
i found i found to be

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,880
absolutely a necessity in building my

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,399
experience and understanding around

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
making sure that i was doing this in a

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
way that was going to be accepted by the

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
fedora community

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,839
had already been accepted by the fedora

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,760
community

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,320
um but the software that i was working

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
with

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
had a deeper reach than i really

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,279
understood and there were a lot of other

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,920
packages a lot of other

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,760
uh components that were dependent upon

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,480
some of the internal requirements that i

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,920
had

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,120
so voter um was

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,839
uh necessary for the for the aws cli

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
but then the aws cli was also necessary

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,519
for

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
uh some other components like the aws

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,920
shell

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
and we had there was another gentleman

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,279
who was who was packaging the

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,040
um the aws shell and

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,279
and he had specific requirements

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,480
and now i was starting to see that i had

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
some

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
downstream collaboration requirements

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,200
here and

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,000
uh needed to really understand better

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
the uh collaborative requirements that i

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,839
had

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,480
to find those associated

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,800
software packaging requirements

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
and to ensure that i was not only

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,519
providing what i needed

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
for um for making sure that the aws cli

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
was fully functional

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,440
but also the dependent projects were

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,760
capable of taking those changes

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
without having any kind of adverse

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,240
effect

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
and this led to me getting a lot more

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
familiar with the downstream process but

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
then

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,640
kind of behind the scenes there was more

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,240
going on

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,320
like i said there was a there were some

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,920
go to market strategies around the

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,920
um the fencing agents for

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,240
high availability that were being

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,839
integrated into

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,200
red hat enterprise linux so the aws cli

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:51,200
was starting to grow in its um

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,839
in its enterprise uh level

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,519
uh or enterprise linux level um

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,440
integration behind the scenes

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,839
and uh and so i was listening to

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,279
um i was listening to this sort of the

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
heartbeat downstream

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,880
uh from where i was but then upstream

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
there were these other things that were

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,920
happening that were

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,959
more specific enterprise goals needed to

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
be paid attention to

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,959
and one of the things that i realized

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,560
early on was that i didn't have a i

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,360
didn't have the ability to

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,360
just blanket

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,839
build these packages in a simple fashion

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,480
and when i started asking around about

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,800
automation and processes for automation

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,079
the answers that i got the responses i i

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
received back from

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,600
other packagers other people who were

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
doing work was that they had their own

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,120
bespoke

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
process for uh tooling to ensure that

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,440
their packaging pipelines were

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
successful and that meant that they

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,680
injected

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,000
specific types of manual uh

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,240
process in where they needed to but they

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
didn't necessarily have

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,760
um they didn't necessarily have a

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,880
process that fit

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,160
into a neatly

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,160
uh bundled stack

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,200
that they could then hand over in a way

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,440
that made a pack

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,480
another packager capable of more

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,639
successful

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,760
uh configuration

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,360
so uh a lot of a lot of time and effort

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
went into building these packages in a

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
manual way

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,399
early on and building that tooling out

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,920
took time uh took me a lot of time

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
because this is when this was not

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,320
somewhere where i had a tremendous

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
amount of

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,519
of deep deep dive experience

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,600
but i was willing to learn and i was

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,639
super excited about that

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
um and this was a this is a

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,360
a picture that frightened me right off

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,560
with the aws cli so if you know anything

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,279
about the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,959
the way that the amazon teams do

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,360
development they really love to

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,839
to land sort of tip of the spear which

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,920
is great when you're

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,760
when you're running something that has a

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,120
very short life cycle

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,519
but for things that have long long term

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,639
uh life cycles like red hat enterprise

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,160
linux

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,320
uh and the and the multitude of versions

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
of fedora that may be available and same

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
with the

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
you know being able to support uh the

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,160
centos packaging in the

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,399
in the in the long term uh you're

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,680
required to kind of create this

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,760
uh you know this uh branching process

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
for each one of those within the context

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,920
of the

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,440
the the diskit server and and so

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
diskette became something that was

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,880
really important and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,920
a and a big part of the

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,519
uh the the the practice so

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,519
um so now as as i'm finding

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,040
more and more responsibility for what's

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
upstream and what's down

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,560
and what's downstream i'm starting to

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,399
feel like

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,399
i have a responsibility to do something

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,079
that had been entirely different before

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,160
so when i first started

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,440
uh working on this package and at the

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,079
aws cli

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,880
one of the things that was uh that was

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,040
necessary

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,560
was that it be available but it didn't

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,320
necessarily have to have

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:22,320
any kind of static existence

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:26,160
in a specific diskette branch

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,440
so for fedora 30 or 29 or whatever

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,000
i didn't have a rawhide i didn't have

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,519
anything besides the build for rawhide

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
because there wasn't any requirement to

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,040
really reach out and do significant

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,560
amounts of testing it just needed to be

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,160
available so that you could you could

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,600
use it in standard systems

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,560
but now with um with

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,680
uh with a with a requirement to have uh

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,199
full support for

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,079
um for the longevity of us of

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
a red hat release things became a little

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
bit more difficult

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
and there i started to get more feedback

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,680
uh

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,639
on the process and to hear more about

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,639
what was required

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,399
so in learning about how to build these

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
packages

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,079
um there's a large amount of

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,000
documentation

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,240
i feel like this is out of order uh

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,880
there's a large amount of documentation

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
that needs to be it needs to be consumed

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
right like so once you're

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
kind of left to your own devices by your

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
sponsor you're

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
you're you're you spend a lot of time

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
reading and and

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,040
concerning yourself with how these

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,199
things uh work

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,120
so um i i spent a lot of time reading

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,680
the documentation around rpm

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
and around different tools in the fedora

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
infrastructure

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,560
and what i found was that many of them

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
were

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,320
either retired or they were task

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,720
specific or a lot of the

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,839
a lot of the details had been had been

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,880
uh related

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,600
from one sponsor to sponsee and

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,639
in a in a way that uh was very

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,560
specifically

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
help beneficial for what for what they

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,079
were working on at the time

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
but it didn't necessarily translate into

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,799
something that was

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,160
a uh um

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,720
an overarching um

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,079
mandate so a lot of the protocol a lot

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,319
of the the decision

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:26,720
process became this sort of um

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,880
living document for how how

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,080
you interact with the pro with the other

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,960
developers

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,000
the other packages the uh the build

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
systems

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,360
all of that had some metrics some

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,559
reporting

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,919
a lot of uh a lot of feedback but there

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
wasn't a whole lot of

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
um there wasn't a whole lot of

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,440
guidelines for how that

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,400
how it's supposed to work so i'd

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
recommend if you're

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,320
if you're doing this work that you spend

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,720
a lot of time looking through

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,760
the rpms that are available within the

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,480
distribution

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,000
and looking at sort of you know looking

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,080
at the source upstream

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
but then translating that back into how

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,880
it relates

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,440
in the um in the package maintenance for

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
longer term support what are we doing in

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
apple to make sure that this is

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,559
this continues to be available and that

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
we're fixing bugs

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,480
what does it mean to do to have a

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,320
package that is in fedora

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,280
and has a has a a division

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,280
of the the versions and yet has some

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,799
consistency in the operations

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,400
how do i get that and what does that

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,160
look like um

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,000
there's a there are lots of those

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,919
questions that are more difficult to

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,720
answer than you might think

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
um especially if you're not a strong

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
developer in the languages that are

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,600
important

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,080
either sort of core to the to the

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,840
packaging itself and you're more

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,360
looking at the operations and trying to

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,120
apply uh

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,120
with help what needs to be done

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,679
uh there's a so so obviously when you're

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
doing that

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
uh you're looking for your that

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,480
collaborative effort

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,240
and you're you're working on those

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,679
you're working on building up that body

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
of knowledge you have to you

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,880
have to go somewhere to find out why

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,480
things are the way they are

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,039
when you don't have a clear picture

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,600
from just a you know one or two line

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,600
change log

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,160
you again this this is a very welcoming

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,160
very very inclusive community and it

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,960
will continue to be that way and so i

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
want to

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,080
encourage you as someone who is learning

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,919
um to put a lot of effort into

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,200
into making sure that people have a good

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,080
understanding of

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,520
of well where where you're falling short

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,440
and how they might be able to help you

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,039
move forward in that direction

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
a lot of times there's there might be

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,120
some you know there might be some big

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
gaps and

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,520
and you don't have to worry about that

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,799
you don't have to start in an area where

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,960
uh the gaps are are are small

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,400
you just have to start and then from

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,799
there

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,480
your commitment your experience and the

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,120
direction that you take as a result of

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
that

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,720
may not be in the direction that you

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,520
originally thought

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,960
but eventually you'll take on the

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
responsib you know you'll take on

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,600
responsibilities in

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,000
in a way that is um that is consistent

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,159
with what your commitment is

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
and i encourage that don't don't think

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,440
that you have to

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,440
suddenly become king of the hill

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,240
um so there's lots of places where the

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,559
feedback comes from and

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
first firstly there's bugzilla and this

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
is somewhere where i was most

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
familiar with interacting with the

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,200
engineers who are working on packages

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,559
is in the place where you file a file an

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
issue and

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,360
they return a response and request more

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,679
assistance with uh stimulating failure

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:53,039
or creating the exact uh

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,840
complication in in a controlled way so

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
that they can

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,080
help you know they can help to identify

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
how to fix that and now here it is your

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,640
turn to be the person who is asking for

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
that

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,799
so you can look for those consumer

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,880
concerns ask for those reproducers

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,240
or build the reproducers yourself in

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,280
ways that are

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,240
um that are beneficial to you

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:20,159
and to your to your audience

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,720
and then the new hotness will will is a

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,440
is a an alert system that is built

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
around

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,559
uh monitoring the upstream community the

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,640
upstream

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,080
uh tags and and um and repositories

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,400
uh with or the tags in those

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
repositories um

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,919
to find find out where you are in terms

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
of

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,919
uh the latest version and how uh how

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,159
you're building that

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
you know gives you an opportunity to to

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,480
have an associated

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,200
uh build process now

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,520
um one of the great things about all of

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,880
the

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,360
uh of bugzilla is that a lot of the

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,720
build

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,720
system uh and the tags that uh

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,760
that you use in the change logs and

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,799
whatnot

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,320
are capable of of um

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,559
executing uh tasks or

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,440
stimulating tasks in the in the build

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,480
system

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,880
to provide more detail around

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,440
the um around the state of a specific

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
uh associated bug so like the new

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,840
hotness will

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,240
file a bug saying you've got version

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,960
1.18.2

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,039
and then you can create a change a

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,840
change set that is associated with that

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,080
bug

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,520
and a change log that has the bug

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,600
identifier in it

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,679
and then you can build that in the build

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,320
system which will then tag that system

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
to

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,840
or tag that ticket to identify that the

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,559
bug has changed state

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
and once you have that changed state you

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,960
uh

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
you can you know it'll change state to

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,480
on qa and then

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
once you have enough karma to release

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,600
that package into

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,799
support then the

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,840
the bug will be kicked

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:09,280
over to the um to completed

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,960
so uh those are some great that's a

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
that's a great kind of automation that's

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
available to you and i want to make sure

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,760
that you know that that's out there and

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,760
and uh possible for you to take

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,760
advantage of another thing that's

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,039
uh that's great is the automatic bug

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
reporting tool

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,919
and that files automatically on behalf

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,799
of consumers who submit those crashes

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,440
so that they can uh they can provide

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,039
better and

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,280
better detail around around your um

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,240
your problems and that aggregates really

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,799
well

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,039
um into uh into sort of a

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,440
a base metric to tell you where you you

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,200
need to focus your energy

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,039
lots of things go wrong when you start

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,840
to try and and

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,120
target specific version specific

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,480
releases

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,360
um in this in that in this crazy diskit

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,440
world

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,279
and uh this is an opportunity for you to

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,840
get some strong constructive feedback

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,720
very quickly

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,120
and then uh my favorite form of guidance

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,320
uh

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,640
and early on came from uh

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
a couple members of the community and

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,080
one particular i think is a great leader

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
in this approach is

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,520
is uh justin uh justin flory and justin

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,919
is

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,279
uh obviously council member for fedora

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,880
and and he's

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,960
someone that i think has been in this

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,919
community for a long time and and built

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,360
up a

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,720
a strong concern and a strong governance

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,919
around

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,000
a code of conduct and uh making sure

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,440
that this is a place where we can all

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,880
participate without being clobbered

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,799
because there are various uh skill

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,720
skill levels here and and it is

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,320
important that we think about

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,840
you know we consider those skill levels

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,559
when we look at how it is that we

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,840
interact

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,960
with the program and then there's the

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,880
proven packager

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,480
so um some of the reason i talk about

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
that sense of tolerance the sense of

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,480
outreach and that that

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
uh concept of having a pull request

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,000
associated with something

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:16,320
so early on in in my experience around

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,120
the um around building packages

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,400
um i made some basic mistakes and one of

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,679
those mistakes was

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,200
was uh um the way that i had formatted a

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,279
specific date

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,960
um in in the change log

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,480
well it was a mistake and it needed to

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
be corrected and needed to be corrected

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,960
over

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,559
over a series of of the change log

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,799
entries and one of the proven packagers

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,919
took the package and reworked the

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,760
the information that i had incorrectly

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:55,200
put together and then uh and then

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,200
submitted it then pinged me in irc

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,320
and let me know what i had done i went

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,919
back to my sponsor we talked about

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,240
and then he showed me a couple of things

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:09,039
that i was that i was missing about

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,279
some tools one of those being our spec

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,080
and so some automation was born around

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,440
that and

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,760
i you know that really led me to a great

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,799
experience but like i said in the you

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
know in the early part of this

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,799
conversation

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,120
there were other things that were going

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,840
on too um i had getting some bugzilla

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,760
reports

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,080
from uh from downstream use right like

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,240
the

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
people like um one of them the member

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,039
who was uh

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,039
who was packaging aws shell

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,799
um basically moved on to uh

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
well came to me after he had determined

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,039
that i was moving a little bit faster

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,760
than

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,039
and was was possible for the for the

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
shell team it turned out they had

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,320
stopped

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,520
most of their development so it wasn't

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
um

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,840
wasn't surprised but he had uh some

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,440
specific requirements around

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,720
the version of pi yaml i think

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
and and uh that that requirement was

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,400
that

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,200
uh that it be uh that we

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,760
loosened the constraints that the aws

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,240
cli

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,760
upstream team had placed on their their

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,279
packaging

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,399
so uh he submitted a and he had

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,880
submitted a a pull request to with a

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,320
patch

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,120
to relax those dependencies in the uh

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,440
in the requirements uh configuration for

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,120
the

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,640
um uh for the

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,080
um pie pie package and

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
that made it possible for me to apply

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,679
the patch relax the dependencies and

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,880
then make the python build

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:49,440
using the standard setup tools uh in the

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,720
in the python um build

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,559
uh and then he could use it and then of

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,960
course that set off a chain reaction

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,159
because one of the reasons that they had

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,399
constrained this

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,440
particular package was because it caused

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,240
an issue

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,880
in the documentation so customers who

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,240
are consumers who were using

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:15,360
the aws cli and then relying on

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:18,240
the the use of graph in their

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,679
in reading the documentation were

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,000
disappointed because

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,320
now they could use the aws shell but

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,360
they couldn't read the documentation

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,279
um and that made it very difficult for

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,559
other people so there was a lot of

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,679
a lot of conversation around that and um

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,880
and we made some modifications but

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,039
meanwhile

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,720
um the uh rail engineering team

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,520
took up uh access or took up the support

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,760
of

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:53,600
the boto3 in um

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,840
in rel and as a result

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,720
they were dependent upon the version of

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,440
botocore and

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:06,640
uh this did not trickle down to me

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,000
uh after i mean

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,919
it didn't trickle down to me while it

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,279
was in in test

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,399
and uh um one and then of course they

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,240
filed a ticket to close off the um

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,320
the access to apple and um

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,240
when i looked in the apple i remember

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
looking in the apple package and finding

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
a

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,320
a change in the in the way that the

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,520
package was identified

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,120
and um and the the

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,240
diskit branch was closed

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,039
and and i didn't really understand why

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,360
but i talked to

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,640
kevin about it and and we had a nice

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
chat saying okay

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,600
yeah there was a a a

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,440
a bug filed by the red hat team and they

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
were they're planning on

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,279
having this as a part of the standard

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,360
rail so it doesn't need to be in the

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,360
extra packages any longer it will be in

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,559
the standards

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,919
the source source rpms

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,640
that it's that it ships with so uh this

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,720
was a great

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,480
experience but then um i found

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,880
that you know of course i was continuing

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,399
to build in the way that i was and i had

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,399
built out some tools and now i was

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,120
getting a little faster at doing the

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,279
process

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,039
but there were a lot of things i think

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,720
well i'm sure that there were a lot of

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,399
things missing in what i was doing

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,200
because

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,440
because one of the proven packagers made

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,120
a decision to

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,919
to execute on rebuilding the aws cli

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,200
and rebuilding the uh the boto core

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,640
together

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,720
along with boto3 and so all three of

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,679
these packages were

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,320
being consumed in in rail engineering

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,279
and

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,480
there was a tighter coupling of the

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,360
process

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,520
that was uh that had that had started to

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,559
take place in terms of their ingestion

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,000
so they wanted

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,440
um they really wanted it's very clear to

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,360
me that although i've never talked to

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,799
them about it it's very clear to me that

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,240
the um that uh

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,399
what they were looking for was a

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,440
consistency that i was not providing in

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,039
the way that i was

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,480
doing the general packaging so um

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:21,440
so i found one day that the build

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,320
system reported back to me that one of

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,960
their builds was

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,120
was completed and in in doing so

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,159
i found myself looking at a package that

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,760
didn't look or

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,600
looking at a spec file that didn't look

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,559
like the ones that i had been creating

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,799
it was much more

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,399
you know it had had a a level of

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,279
sophistication that i wasn't

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,840
um i wasn't yet capable of and so i was

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,919
looking

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,960
looking at it and i was interested and

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,399
so it was like

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
what are you you know what are you doing

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,399
on what are you doing on my package i

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,240
can't believe you're

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,760
working on my package you know this was

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,640
sort of what i was thinking immediately

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,080
and then when i looked

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,399
i started looking at the package and i

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,240
thought i thought oh wow that's uh

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,919
oh that's smart yeah oh i would have

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,480
never known to ingest

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,600
that specific patch to fix this specific

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,000
bug

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,679
uh the way you did this here this is

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
interesting and it comes directly from

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,440
the upstream and it looks like

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,279
you have a one-to-one match and there's

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,600
a seems like a

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,279
close communication wow yeah i could

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,799
really learn a lot here from

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,720
from watching how this works and so

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,720
you know a lot of that effort on my

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,080
education around building these packages

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,559
started to and and

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,919
being sort of closely connected to these

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,760
these packages

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,760
um was starting to uh dissolve

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,480
into this passive relationship

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,240
with the work that was being done around

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,120
the packages that i

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,120
felt responsible for but seemed to be

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,360
but seemed to be watching as other

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,760
people more senior than myself

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,200
started to push real you know

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,720
interesting changes

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,919
into and and making megan headway

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,919
so um so

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,760
i felt like that was the right answer in

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,240
the under those circumstances was for me

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,360
to

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,120
to kind of accept all this help and

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,360
and to see it and i hope that you know

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,080
in in the same experience

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,440
you would feel the same way that that or

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,559
you know i think

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,399
i think this is a a positive experience

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,559
right in in the sense that

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,679
that at first i thought that maybe i was

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,279
missing something and

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,360
my and they were they were missing

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,559
something in my guidance

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,320
and then i realized that there was a

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,360
long way away there was a long way in

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,519
between

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,279
our the body of knowledge that they had

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,640
in terms of packaging and my body of

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,240
knowledge for packaging

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,760
and then it might be very difficult for

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,159
them to spend a lot of time

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,919
trying to push this through for me when

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,720
they had goals and deadlines that were

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,880
associated with go to market strategies

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,240
far beyond what it was that i was trying

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,760
to do and you know in the

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,120
in the context of of um the the

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,399
the community experience so

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,240
um but but still all of the work that

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,519
they were doing was still being reported

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,599
back to me so i

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,520
was able to you know still able even

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,839
today i'm still able to

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,280
to maintain and manage the the reporting

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,440
and ensure that if there are corrections

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,000
that need to be taken that i'm taking

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,040
those if

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,320
i uh you know if i need to make

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,560
modifications to package itself

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,440
to ensure that things are happening like

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,200
suppression of the v1 information

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,240
versus v2 i can i can do that and

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,639
they also can take what i've done and

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,599
remove the parts that are offending

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,720
right that are not

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,639
passing the quality control and they can

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,480
uh they can rebuild those packages so

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
that they're in they're consistent with

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,000
the requirements that they have for

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
upstream for downstream quality

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,440
so this is an interesting question now

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,119
right because now i've got

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,440
i've got uh sort of a looking glass into

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,359
these two packages that i that i started

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,000
with at the beginning of the year

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,480
and i was super excited about uh dealing

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,680
with them

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,400
right in the in the uh in that

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,280
that first section my sponsor you know

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,320
has been

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,680
sort of uh off but then now i have many

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
more i mean there's many more people

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,359
that i talk to on

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,119
on a daily basis doesn't there's not one

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,720
person who needs to be responsible for

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,000
my efforts on it on

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,079
uh on any given day um

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,119
but i'm still looking in on the packages

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,440
that that uh

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,400
uh you know i originally felt like i was

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,000
responsible for

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,520
and and i'm not seeing uh the

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,040
work be done so um guidance of

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,160
governance started to become something

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,160
that i did have

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,280
kind of a a sense of and the aws cli was

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
a perfect

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,960
a perfect spot right so so what was

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,200
going on was we were

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,119
we were working on the aws cli version

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,960
one and version two came out

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,640
well version two was uh exclusive from

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,320
version one so there's

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,760
there were some component parts that

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,119
were shared

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,160
in terms of the the abstract components

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,079
but then

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,760
the version 2 itself provided for

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,599
a lot more flexibility in terms of the

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,119
of the build process for the

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,000
participants

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,680
within the context of of the greater aws

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
ecosystem

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,400
and what i mean by that is that it was

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,280
no longer in pi pi

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,280
so this version two was no longer

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,760
available to customers

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,200
in a way that was consumable so i turned

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,280
my efforts there

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,240
and then started to make a lot of those

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,920
those that effort that i had pushed into

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
building relationships with the upstream

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,280
community

00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,720
and the upstream uh uh maintainers

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
towards helping them to make decisions

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,400
about how they were going to build out

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,560
their open source program and make this

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,520
possible to have a better developer

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,560
experience

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,760
um for their customers and

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,800
uh and consumers i mean in this sense we

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,040
as fedora are a strong consumer of the

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,040
uh

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,160
of the um uh

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,079
the package itself right so or or the

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,920
the application itself and so we want to

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,680
package it in a way that is

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,920
consistent with the distribution

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,520
experience but if it's not open source

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,240
or if the component parts are not open

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,599
source

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,440
then suddenly we're just doing the

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,720
framework and the plugins don't really

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,560
matter because they

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,839
they don't come from somewhere

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,280
independent they were

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,599
coming from a single source

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,920
so it can't separate out separated out

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,520
into what's open source and what's

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,119
closed um when they're when

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,359
systems are being delivered in both

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,800
binary format and non-binary form and

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,800
just in time compile format

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,480
so trying to work on that availability

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,359
became

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,800
a big focus and you know there was a

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,320
little bit of a struggle there too i

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,160
mean i was looking for other packages

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,599
and i just kind of reached out in

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,359
different directions and tried to figure

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,880
out if i could do things that were

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,280
mildly interesting and s and and related

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,920
to

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,520
the environment that i was most closely

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,640
uh supporting which is the

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,079
amazon ec2 environment and

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,480
other other utilities

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,640
and yeah i still own these two packages

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,520
but that maintenance is an ongoing

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,520
problem for

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,520
people who are more directly involved in

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,480
the in the in the day-to-day maintenance

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,480
of the

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,200
of the rail engineering um and so now

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,200
i'm

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,800
building my relationship with the next

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,160
generation tooling

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,079
groups and hoping to create a scenario

00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,000
in which we can better

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:05,280
we can better consume those

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,280
into the uh into the fedora distribution

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,000
uh if you're not a package maintainer

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,040
now

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and i think i'm i fully intended to to

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,960
write this in a way

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,720
that was encouraging for people who

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,520
aren't package maintainers

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,079
uh start with this wiki and and walk

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,599
through

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,000
what's going on in the wiki but don't

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,520
make it necessary for you to understand

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,720
every inch every component part

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,920
every skill every exception

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,240
that's listed and sort of detailed there

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,160
just jump in let's get started let's

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,599
have some conversations

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,079
if you feel like there are people who

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,599
are uh way more advanced who

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,359
seem to think that there's a lot more

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
ground that you need to cover there are

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,480
people like me out there who are

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,359
intermediate and can help

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,400
more you know along those lines i'm more

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,640
likely to be

00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,720
on uh irc than i am to reply back to the

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,760
appropriate devil list

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,359
um so i would say reach out in both

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,359
directions depending on where

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,000
where it is that you're you know that

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,000
you're um

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,359
that you're most comfortable and then

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,319
wherever it is that you're most

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,040
comfortable

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,839
make sure you reply um so that you're

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,040
replying

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,040
in an appropriate manner uh so that uh

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,240
so that you can take part in that

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,079
and then the other thing is as an

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,359
upstream contributor you have

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,119
there's a lot of things that are being

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,680
done in terms of the packaging that we

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,839
want

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,440
to make sure have an upstream first kind

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,319
of goal

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,240
and that upstream first goal means

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,520
taking the testing frameworks that are

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,200
that are necessary for

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,000
ensuring that the packages are fully

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,040
functional and getting those into the

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,319
uh the systems uh for the for the

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,760
application itself

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,520
so that you can see that in terms of

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,240
code coverage and you can

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,640
verify that those uh switches and the

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,640
appropriate parts that are there for

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,480
uh supporting the distributions that are

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,280
supported

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,640
are there in the package in the upstream

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,440
application itself

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,720
not just somewhere down below with no

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,760
concerns over

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,480
over how that affects the the overall uh

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,400
deployments

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,400
so um i think yeah that's the

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,440
that's my advice on getting started

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,800
and now just want to say thank you for

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,560
coming to the talk and

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,560
thank you for being here at debconf i

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,680
think this is one of the greatest

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,880
experiences that

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,960
that i have had is being at devconf and

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,520
i miss the camaraderie and the hallway

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,640
discussions and the ability to have that

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,800
uh close interaction but

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,800
i'm grateful for uh the hop-in

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,960
experience and and this makes things

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
super

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,880
uh super easy for us to enjoy some time

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,960
together

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,920
so i'm really grateful that you're all

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,240
here and

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,200
uh glad glad to talk to you about

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,359
anything

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800
that is interesting to you about

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,560
packaging or

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,240
about getting involved in fedora and

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,440
just in general

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
even if it's just to become an

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,760
ambassador and and to talk about

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:17,839
uh talk about fedora in a way that is

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,839
consistent i think that's very important

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,680
thank you so much david for that amazing

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,920
talk and

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,599
i think uh what you said at the end

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,599
totally resonates with

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,800
how we are all feeling right now so

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,040
thank you for being there

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,240
virtually with us um we really

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,880
appreciate it

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,359
okay did that work yes that totally

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,400
worked

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,839
can hear you now yeah did anybody

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,839
have any other questions

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,040
there's definitely time now

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,079
i don't think it was very difficult in

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,520
fact just asking on the

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,599
uh just asking on the mailing list

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,720
you'll find somebody who's willing

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,359
but i i think it's

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,079
important to find someone that you enjoy

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,720
working with

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,280
right and that was something that i

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,359
thought was

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,440
was difficult was finding the right

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,960
person and the right balance of

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,200
of not being too annoying to someone and

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,880
and just because of the general

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
familiarity

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,400
but then them having the same you know

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,680
like a

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,680
an ability to help you um bootstrap

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,200
and it really is right you don't want to

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,240
be you want to make someone responsible

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,319
for your

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,440
uh you know for your learning experience

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,440
for the rest of their lives

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,000
then i would pick the documentation

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,640
it's really difficult to figure out what

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,680
what

00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,160
tools really exist and what tools don't

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,160
exist

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,839
that totally makes sense

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,960
oh thanks so much i think ben has a

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,880
question on the chat

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,280
um if you could fix one thing about the

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,560
process what would you fix yeah

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,560
documentation yeah right

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,280
yeah i mean

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,119
documentation is engineering so i i

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,560
fully take responsibility for that

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,560
so pound action dab dunk will

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,119
