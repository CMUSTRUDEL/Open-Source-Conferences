00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,360
for

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,119
data services ai and machine learning

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
infrastructure record hat

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,799
also been involved a lot in the open

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,360
data hub since inception trying to

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
figure out

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
the data services and the privacy and

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,040
security aspects of it

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,040
okay uh this was a bit where i was going

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,880
to ask alex to introduce himself

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,799
but he just disconnected

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,119
um well i guess i can introduce him alex

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,560
is technically my boss so

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,200
um he is yeah one of the managers for

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,320
the

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
um open data up team at red hat and he's

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,240
responsible

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,280
primarily for running it oh there you go

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,759
i'll let you do that alex who are you

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
and what do you do

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
for from the introduction let me know if

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,119
my internet starts to drop

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,039
i've just moved into a new house and

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,479
right now i met my in-laws who have had

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,760
internet because my new house doesn't

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,760
have internet yet

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,120
um like any said i am i

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,959
at red hat i am a manager on red hat's

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
internal data hub team

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,720
if you're familiar with the open data

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
hub project uh well i guess if you're

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,920
not familiar with the open data hub

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
project is a platform for doing

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
data science machine learning type

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
things on openshift and my team we run

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
an instance of that open data hub here

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
at red hat

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
to enable teams at red hat to use

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,519
ubinata hub to do data science type

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,640
workloads

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,040
um and as part of that we own or well we

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
we own a platform that stores and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
manages a pretty large amount of data

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
and we have

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
plenty of challenges around that uh

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,200
sharing that that data with

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,840
various different teams awesome

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
um so yeah i guess i'll kick things off

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
then with some

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
paired um jamie uh

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
would you mind telling us a little bit

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,159
more about what a day is like in your

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
life

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
what are some of the operational things

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,680
you need to worry about you know all

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
that

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,760
fun stuff all the amazing things

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,120
that um everyone is always interested in

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
um

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,319
so for me it's it's you know i start my

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
day

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,440
you know looking at the news really to

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,920
see what's happening in the privacy

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
space

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
right you know you see changes every day

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
um your privacy shield you have the

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
brazil

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,319
um privacy law you have i yesterday i

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,080
saw something from washington state

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,560
um you know privacy um has is making its

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
way

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
through the headlines on a daily basis

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
so you know kind of you know trying to

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
think what are our customers going to be

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
asking

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
what are the requirements you know what

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
type of approach are we going to take

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,799
what are the guard rails that we can

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,799
put in place what are the business

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,560
controls from an operational standpoint

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
or technical standpoint

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,680
um you know those are the things that i

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,879
really think about

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
um on a daily basis and

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,400
how we can always improve right so as

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
things change that gives us an

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,959
opportunity

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
to improve the process and and the

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,840
experience as well

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,639
all right all right thank you um

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,959
sorry trying to leave from that um

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
how so there's a lot of open source

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,320
projects within the space

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,479
right like for data security things like

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,639
open apa

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,560
open policy agent um the previous

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
presentation talked about openscap

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,960
then you have like enochs data mesh

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,479
eject exeria

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,160
how do you sort of see those fitting

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
into like this bigger picture of

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
protecting data

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,880
right both within red hat or at in the

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
industry as a whole

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
so uh i can kick that off yes so there

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,600
are a series of new open source projects

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
that have been incubated over the last

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
two or three years

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
specifically on the data privacy and

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
security aspect and

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,360
what these projects are good in that

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,280
they are following the

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
the path laid out to the original

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,880
database sort of a workload right

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,199
you still have lots of unstructured data

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
but the the policy the security the

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
governance models and

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,840
the requirements haven't changed and

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,280
we're seeing a good amount of open

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
source projects come up around those

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
areas

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,600
the next step of evolution what i see

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,759
based on

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
interacting with these communities is

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,039
the need to put these projects together

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
into a true solution

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,720
right now there's some good projects

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,320
solving are really good problems

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,000
but we need a way to connect them

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
together we need standards or

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
standard interfaces to connect all of

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
these together so you get that

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
security and privacy requirements but

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
also the end user and the admin and the

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
chief data officer experience that they

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
desire

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,919
so do you think companies are ready to

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
start

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,240
adopting some of these open source tools

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,639
for security and data governance

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,759
or do you think like the push is still

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
towards some of the

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,680
larger commercial offerings or

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,680
commercial close source offerings

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,520
so i'm going to come to it from a

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,800
slightly different direction

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,319
so i'm i'm my interest is more on some

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
of the lower level tech

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
that can support some of this these

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,160
capabilities

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
and i think we are definitely seeing a

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
world where

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
companies are getting wise to the fact

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,560
i'm not just companies you know large

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
organizations are getting wise the fact

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
that

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,960
open source means that it's auditable

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
it means that you know you've got to

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
beware the many i's hypothesis

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,520
where thing open is just better because

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,479
more people look at it because security

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
isn't like that

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,880
you need trained good people uh who are

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
experts looking at it

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,639
in a in a structured way but when you

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,639
have

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,080
you know companies such as red hat or

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,599
you know many companies

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,400
out there supporting open source

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
and security related uh products or

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,759
projects

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,199
um and making sure that though you do

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,880
have expert eyes

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
i think that people are beginning to

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,800
realize from the bottom up at least

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,960
that actually there's a lot of benefit

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
to that

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,800
and what's more you know if someone if

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
you don't need to have multiple people

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,240
multiple organizations auditing a a

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
project

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
from different points of view they

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,080
cannot it can all be done once

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
um and there's some interesting things

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,840
going on in the in the world out there

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
about supply chain

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,599
uh and how you manage that and the open

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
source world etc

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,039
but at least it's open at least you can

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,960
see it and i think that

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,560
you know companies are realizing that

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
certainly from the bottom up now i can't

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
talk

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
to some of these the sort of higher

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
level constructs that are being put

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
together about that

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,840
other folks on the call can but i would

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,639
be surprised if that doesn't start

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,919
happening

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:53,039
uh as if it hasn't already uh frankly

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,160
yep so so to add to what mike said

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,599
uh this uh what what we're looking

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
seeing in open source is a lot of these

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
good technologies being developed

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
right but as i look at from the

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
community and the community composition

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,560
perspective

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,400
this is a great area and a chance to

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
bring the non-technical folks into open

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,919
source to bring the auditors to bring

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
the lawyers to bring the legal folks

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,120
getting

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,879
the right thing in security and privacy

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
and that domain needs a lot more

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,879
expertise than just technical uh

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,639
experience and documentation right we

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
need the domain knowledge and we need to

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,400
expand the scope of these

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,319
open source communities to include those

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
knowledge experts that can help the

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,960
communities

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,719
uh and then produce the right project

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,839
and product i think that's where

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:41,200
we have a big uh step to to to go next

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,599
couldn't agree more um you know i i

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
it worries me whenever we have any

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
project

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
which doesn't look just beyond the

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
techies well for pretty much anything

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
but

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
particularly where you're in a world of

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
compliance and auditing and things

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
you absolutely need to have have that

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,480
involvement and as you say in open

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
source is a great opportunity

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:09,839
to do that any anyone have any ideas

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:09,839
about how to encourage that

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,959
so on my tv open data team

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
um you know i absolutely echo what you

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,920
guys have been saying when we've been

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,519
able to get people just

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,920
you know my team which is purely

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,959
technical involved in these sorts of

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,880
discussions

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
uh we've we've been able to see really

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,120
great progress you know just

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,120
if nothing more than identifying

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,440
requirements and use cases for what we

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,600
need

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,920
as coming our background is not purely

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,839
managing data and building out big

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,360
enterprise level systems for that

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,880
we don't have necessarily the years of

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,160
expertise around that

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,680
i've done a really good job um

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,600
at least within the open data hub

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
community seeking to

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,279
like actively pull out that engagement

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,200
or the the those

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,640
uh engagements those community members

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,080
right so mike to your question how do

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,839
you get people involved

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,360
um i think you have to be really

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,320
deliberate in inviting people to come

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,160
and

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
ask them to come i think we've found you

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
know and certainly across all the open

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,279
open source communities we've been and

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
people are really eager to help they

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
just

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
want to know they need to know what to

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,720
help with right i think being very

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,480
deliberate intentional with

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,079
um you know keeping your eyes open for

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
people who have experts that have these

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,160
expertise you're looking for

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,519
and inviting them to community meetings

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,600
inviting them to present with your team

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,720
inviting them to collaborate and being

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,720
about we need you experts on you know

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
what three requirements do people have

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,839
need to have for data governance right

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,279
you know give them something specific to

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,920
help with i think people are

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:46,880
eager to help yep

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,200
yeah and what alex uh the other one

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,519
thing

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,279
also that's different in here is it's

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,480
it's also more cultural in that

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,320
open source communities have

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
traditionally been looked at as areas

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
for incubating great technology right

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,680
but we need to front and some of that

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,920
with the classic like you said the

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,399
closed source offering processes where

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,240
we have wireframes or mock-ups that we

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,920
can bring these non-technical folks into

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,279
but still get some really good feedback

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,079
make sure they understand and we

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:18,320
understand the requirements

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:21,200
question uh yeah um so gerard griffin

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
um was asking so i guess let's say me uh

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
many of the protection laws that have

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
been put out there

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,880
are wake policies and processes are you

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
seeing anything being done from the open

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,480
source communities to help bridge

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,640
government policies with

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,040
practical usage of being able to execute

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
on these

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,079
i think an example here would be the

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,800
foundational pieces

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
that you know you're following for you

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,680
know something like the gdpr

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,120
right so i mean that's something that

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,639
would be foundational from like a

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,240
privacy by design

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,200
security by design lens right um and

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,880
then you would then

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,279
you know create your own processes and

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,959
guidelines and policies around

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,480
how you're interpreting that right and

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,680
following that and how you can

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,600
go back and audit it and um basically

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
you know verify and improve as you go

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,360
along right so

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,720
um i don't have any specific examples

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,920
but i think that is

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
you know a guiding principle that you

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,600
know

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,720
you would as an example for gdpr

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,240
so i'm aware of one um which is being

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
talked about at the moment

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
um so um i talked about the anarchs

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
project that's part of

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,200
a um a linux foundation project called

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
uh

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
the confidential computing consortium

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
which is about using trusted execution

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,680
environments to

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,959
to protect uh data in use so

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,920
um we're already thinking about whether

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,320
we should be

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,440
engaging with standards bodies to say

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
you know

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
gdpr says you're only allowed to keep

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,760
stuff

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,720
oh i'm oversimplifying it let's say some

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
of these things say

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,120
you have to have things encrypted at all

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,560
times if they're outside a particular

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,000
jurisdiction

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,880
is it acceptable to say as long as it's

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,760
encrypted

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,639
in this hardware controlled and audited

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,600
manner to be running stuff so i could

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,040
let's say

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,600
process data in this protected way

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,120
because it's always encrypted from the

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,079
rest of the host

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,279
um in a different jurisdiction and i

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,920
think

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,040
they're hippa uh there's some other

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,360
things around there about

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,920
we've got these new technical controls

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,920
um can we apply them in ways

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,720
uh that would allow that meet that

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
meet the spirit of the law or spirit of

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,639
the regulations

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,160
where frankly the the letter

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,240
is not clear and i think there's some

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,839
opportunities arising in a number of

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,959
areas there actually that's just one

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
that i happen to be a big

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
bit

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
very interesting yeah i really never

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
thought about it from that perspective

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,199
you know

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,800
thanks for that um taking a step back

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,480
from open source um

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,560
what are some challenges that we

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,800
generally see our customers facing with

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,079
requests regarding data security and

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,560
privacy

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,680
so what yes i think you know for our

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
customers they

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,959
they think obviously it's in a data

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,519
breed

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
and that's that's brand that's

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
reputation

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
that's money that's fines all the things

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,199
right

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,839
liability um you know they are looking

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,079
to see

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,600
you know how what you know

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
certifications you have

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
you know they're looking to see how you

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,320
um

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,240
you know how are you what are your

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
controls for how you implemented you

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
know something

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
in the privacy or security space you

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,880
know what are you doing

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
in these areas um you know there's a lot

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,720
of questions that we get asked but

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
you know those things you know help us

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
to understand

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
you know the new requirements coming

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
down right so you asked me what was top

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,399
of mind

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,160
of my everyday is always making sure

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,279
that i'm up to date on what's happening

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
in the world because

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,480
we are going to get a question from our

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,560
customers asking

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680
hey i just saw this what are you guys

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,560
doing about it right

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,519
so you know really just making sure that

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,240
we are

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,880
you know we acknowledge that we um you

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
know

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,720
are following and you know understand

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,480
that we you know we are implementing you

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,600
know as we kind of go along as well as

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
things you know change

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,320
so quickly

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
so the yeah so from my role of talking

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
to our customers and trying to

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,839
understand

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,519
across the management's chain and on

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
what the challenges are

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,279
one thing that always keeps pops up is

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,959
trying to balance this idea of security

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,560
and privacy and compliance

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,320
with keeping the data set meaningful

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,079
enough to do something useful with it

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,800
right you can't anonymize every element

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,480
of a data set

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,079
and then make it useful we have to find

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
that right balance

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
and then the other key challenge that

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
goes with it is it's also about

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
automating that process of solving the

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,240
challenge right even if we know how to

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,399
sanitize a data set

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
are there tools are there uh projects

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
out there that can automate it because

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,160
a human being can only look at so many

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,120
lines of data sets and anonymize it

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
manually right

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
is there a standardization process that

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,000
can be done like here's a standard

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
process for anonymizing a medical image

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
it is what you do if it's payroll data

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
right

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,440
the missing link there is is that there

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,959
aren't many projects or uh software

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,959
solutions in that area too

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:37,839
yeah a problem space

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,120
that we work in a lot i'm worried

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
or let me know if it is but uh my team

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,759
is in

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,279
is you own it kind of a general purpose

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,240
data lake here at red hat right so we

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,639
have

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,079
countless numbers of discrete data

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,759
sources in our system

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,440
added every day right um for us to be

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,320
able to

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
manually audit that entire data set and

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,360
know

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
you know what has information in it what

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,959
needs to have restricted access

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,439
etcetera you could never try and scale

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,120
to do that all on our own so

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,280
looking for open source tools that will

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,760
let us automate the process

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,360
is is key um we're fortunate to have

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,199
some some great partners

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
here in the office of the cto at red hat

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,600
they're you know building

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,199
aiops types type pipelines where you

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,679
know we try and

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,319
do things like automate scanning of data

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,799
to identify what needs to be masked

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,480
um you know that's a big kind of area

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,840
where we see a lot of potential there to

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
to be able to scale out

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,679
yeah so i was lucky enough to be able to

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,240
take part in a red hat research day

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,400
uh earlier this week uh where this this

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
came up specifically i just put the link

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,039
actually in the

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,200
in the chat um at the the sessions

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,240
were recorded and should be available to

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
watch soon

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
but there's some really interesting

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,919
academic work going on some which is

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,440
beginning to bleed through i'm sure that

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
you know alex and folks are aware of

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
this um and we have some

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
interesting links with uh harvard and uh

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,000
boston university and folks

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,320
uh people who are working on this sort

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
of

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,440
area i just thought it might be

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
interesting for people to uh have a look

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,240
around there

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
really complex stuff it turns out and

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
really interesting too but

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,120
it looks like some of this stuff is

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,280
beginning to bleed through into

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,280
real world use cases which is fantastic

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,039
so i guess this may be a loaded question

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,039
but um are you starting to see some

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,200
engagements between like these

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,280
academic research things and like open

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,280
source communities in the space

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,440
or do you foresee that being something

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,880
that should be happening

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,679
one very specific example of a uh

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,600
of a corpus that's being put together um

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,480
for that it's called open dp

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,960
open differential privacy or privacy if

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
you're

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,559
if you're a brit like me um which is

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,120
trying to

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,039
bring together some of those tools uh

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,799
and make make them open source the

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,840
algorithms the tools the uh

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,480
the the frameworks as well i think it's

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,200
a

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,320
um an area where academics and realizing

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,919
that actually it's a great way to get

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,640
some visibility is to go more open

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,679
source

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,760
um i again i'm not hugely um

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
uh in a great position to talk about

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,039
this i just

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,720
watched the talks and i'm passing on

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,559
what i what i found it

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,919
really interesting i highly recommend

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
that anyone uh

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
who's interested yeah we've got some

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,559
more questions people keep asking

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,600
questions that awkward

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,799
yeah it's a good thing right they're

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,840
engaged

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,280
so ricardo asked um with the growing

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,520
number of privacy laws

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,960
uh in the world how can a company adhere

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,960
to all of these laws

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
what guidance should they be looking for

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,200
yeah that is a great question and i

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,720
think

00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,000
the the gdpr bar was so is that like

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,559
foundational you know um

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,400
really made us think about privacy in a

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,280
totally different way than we ever have

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
right in it a lot of companies took a

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
global approach red hat has taken a

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,280
global approach so when you take that

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,440
global approach it makes it a lot easier

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,039
to then adjust to the personnel law as

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,720
an example because it's kind of a copy

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,280
of the gdpr yes there's some differences

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
but it's

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,360
it's there's a lot of similarities and

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,200
how you would implement it right and

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,559
the ones that really get tricky are the

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,159
ones that are um

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,600
you know the ones that are on top of

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,520
like the gdpr

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,039
and the ones that are state-specific in

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,320
north america as an example

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,760
you know there's so many different

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
nuances that you have to follow so if

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,159
you take like the

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,200
the you know the the highest bar and you

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
say okay we're gonna take the global

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
approach that it's you cast such a wide

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,080
net that you can

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,200
then you know be able to move with the

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,679
changes

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,640
rather than and be more proactive and

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,440
versus a reactive mode and you also have

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,640
um some time right to implement um based

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,360
on when things kind of go

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,360
in effect and how you're enforcing

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
so jamie a quick follow-up question then

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
to that is uh

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
i mean this what you said seems pretty

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,360
similar to what we see in the tax law

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
side of the world right every county

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,600
state

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
a country has a completely different way

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,679
of doing things or

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,679
that may not fit together but that has

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
been to a certain extent automated with

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
this

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,880
talk softwares and such right so do you

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,360
foresee something like that being

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,640
possible in in in the security and

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
privacy area and then

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,080
would open source be a good area so we

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,159
can all have a common code base to build

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,080
upon what do you think of it

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,159
yeah no i think it'd be great i'm always

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,039
looking for open source

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,679
um solutions with you know compliance

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,440
and

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,120
i just would love to see more of it i

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,880
think this is a space it's a huge

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,679
opportunity where even in the commercial

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
space

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,120
you don't really see a good solution

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,320
right they're all kind of the same

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,640
they're not really they don't really

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,960
fulfill all the requirements

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,760
um so i mean i would love to kind of you

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
know see

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,039
an open source version that would help

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
on a global level

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,080
right someone who can you know something

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
that would encompass

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,320
you know everywhere that we can kind of

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
put it together and put the similarities

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,640
together so you can see it holistically

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,320
right um and not being so you know

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,360
region specific if you will

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,159
but yeah i think it's a great

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,600
opportunity and there's a lot out there

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,600
to kind of you know kick off

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,480
interesting so i well

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,320
speaking of that then right like do you

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
see intelligent automation of all of

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,600
this stuff

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,360
being very um important right access

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,880
with all the data growing

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,720
it's just growing right more and more

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
companies you keep adding more data you

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,840
have more data centers everywhere

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
i think well i say i think what do you

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,200
think of like

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,720
building our open source systems with

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,039
this

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
automation built in from the get go

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,840
right was this sort of trying to

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,559
go back and apply some ml principles to

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,760
it yeah and i think that goes back to

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,159
the principle of just

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,600
treating data as an asset right i think

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,320
you know we really have to look at it in

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,880
that way

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,799
and um and then the rules kind of are

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
like the guard rails to kind of ensure

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,320
that you're moving that forward but yeah

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,600
there's no way that we could do this

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,960
manually

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,440
at all and we shouldn't be doing it

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,039
manually in 2020 right so

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,480
i think you definitely you need those

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,120
technical business controls and policies

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,280
um to safeguard you know you along the

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
way

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
yeah echo like automation is going to be

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,840
required

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,440
what i think will be interesting to see

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,760
is automation gets pushed out

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
to like the the edge to use an

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,840
overloaded term of where the data

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,679
gets generated right it seems like

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,960
trying to do all this automation on a

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,000
central data lake

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,520
um would just entail these massive batch

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,279
jobs that would take forever because of

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,919
how much data they have to operate on

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,679
which

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,600
you know might not produce the best

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,640
results or at least add some latency

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,799
right can we push

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
can we push that automation out closer

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,559
to the the source of the data to know

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,640
as data is coming in um you know flag

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,640
identify whatever sensitive data gets

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
generated do whatever masking we can or

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,440
at least

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,799
you know flag it for future processing

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,159
kind of thing i think

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,919
that would be an interesting space to

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
see what

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,279
that was again something that came up in

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,039
on the research day it was talked about

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,960
a bit there's some interesting things

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,480
um going on that's worth worth finding

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,000
out about i i

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,840
try not sound like an expert because i'm

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,840
really not

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,960
very cool

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,520
so we've been talking a lot about

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,440
gdpr and ccpa right now like not quite

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
specifically but sort of dancing around

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,159
those questions

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,919
um what have you seen

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,600
for your customers who are already using

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,600
open source products

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,760
right and it doesn't have to be products

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
for data compliance or data security but

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
just

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,960
you know general usage of open source

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,080
products how is it affecting their

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,720
day-to-day with sort of their workflows

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
and

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,000
you know going more specific how is it

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,120
affecting what they try to do with the

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
ai and machine learning

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:25,360
i think gdpr is your individual

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
right to privacy and your california

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,919
consumer

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,080
privacy act is really focused on the

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,799
consumer right and kind of

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,200
protecting um a specific demographic

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,799
right

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,919
for their right to privacy um i think

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,600
um you know there's

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,039
we need to find a better way to automate

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
i think that's been like the theme here

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,240
right you know for sure

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
is is something that we need to do but

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
understanding the difference between the

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,200
two

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,720
right is that um but they all kind of

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,840
mesh together right um

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,679
i think that um just the requirements

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
um we need to make it easier just to

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,880
audit

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,559
and to make sure that those business

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
controls are the ones and technical

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,240
controls are the right ones and

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,440
and that we can adjust along the way

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,919
yeah so yeah so uh

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,520
from people customers using open source

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,000
uh uh the feedback has been

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,640
good so they they they see a project

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
that's open

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,000
so they they can go look at the code and

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
figure out and make sure it does exactly

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,600
what it does and this node watching what

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,400
is hidden inside or no loopholes right

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,320
so

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,080
the place where open source helps is for

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,240
security and privacy is

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,760
you don't just get to control your data

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,279
on paper you can

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
have you or a friend look at the code

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,600
and say that it really controls and does

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,360
the right thing

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,360
right so that's where we're seeing a lot

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,039
of positive feedback and then good vibes

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,559
on the open source side

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,159
uh the the areas i think we need to

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,440
still work on on the open source aspect

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,440
is one

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,440
make sure we put like are you the right

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,039
usability framework around it right most

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,120
of these tools in the end are supposed

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,559
to cater to a non-technical audience

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
highly technical in their fields like

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,520
the legal and auditing field

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,600
but not technical in the computer

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,840
science sense of the world right

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,240
so we need to make sure we make these

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,360
tools applicable and easy enough uh to

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
their workflows and

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,960
and to their usability standards that's

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
where i think

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,559
we we have a gap that we need to close

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
fast

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,000
and then comes uh this is where the

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,000
commercial aspect of open source

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,120
comes right we have a solution but

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,120
there's also

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,399
the the legal certifications that we

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
have to go through these agencies that

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,279
we have to go

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
and run their test feeds or have them

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,200
look through the code and certify that

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,440
the tool

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,200
is the right tool to use and that is

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,440
where some of the commercial vendors

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,799
dealing in open source can really help

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,880
because they already have

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
staff that can do that or have had those

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,520
relationships in the past so that's

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,760
another area where

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:52,399
we can really help out

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,440
so to kind of harp a little bit on the

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,720
technical

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,399
uh usage aspect alex have you

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,399
have you seen any problems with this

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,840
internally right since you manage a big

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,120
data

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,120
do you have any thoughts to share here

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,720
i think i think the biggest challenge we

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,960
have is

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,960
there are all these open source tools in

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,760
this space right there are all these

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,080
different places where you might store

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
data

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,679
for us it's elasticsearch and kafka and

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,039
s3 right and there's

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,480
all these different tools that processed

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,960
it and there's all these different tools

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
that

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
people use to analyze data and in the

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,799
past

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,880
um i think you know there were a few big

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,399
players in the space so it was easier to

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,159
build a solution that worked for that

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,720
one big player but today

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,399
people want to use one of n different

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,320
tools they want to be able to pick the

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,919
best of breed that's to

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,559
the best of breed of what's available to

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,159
them and so from an auditing and

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,000
security side

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,279
it has to work with everything and do

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,880
its job really well with everything

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,720
that's that's the challenge we're really

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,039
trying to overcome and so that's

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,320
that's honestly what has made progress a

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,880
little slow for us

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,480
um you know trying to figure out what is

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,320
what is that the lowest hanging fruit or

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,039
the the highest priority thing to try

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,440
and

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,279
try and tackle in the security space or

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,840
in a solution to build with these open

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,840
source tools

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,559
well it's like you could read my mind

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,279
you just set up my next question

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,919
to some extent um so we're talking about

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,120
all this like

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,159
transitions to technology right um and

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,520
like

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,279
these different paradigms where you have

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,840
all these different tools coming in

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,200
um good i think this might be for you um

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,159
how do you think the evolution of like

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,520
how we store

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,000
and access this data has effect affected

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,440
these

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,840
um the tools organizations are using

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,840
you know

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,720
that um

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,200
certainly with

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,279
with gdpr you know adding constraints on

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,840
where data can be stored

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,760
um it it forced people to be more

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,880
flexible in how they ran so previously

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,559
when when like

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,480
you know corporations controlled all the

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,320
data and could decide you know where to

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,200
run the data whatever is easiest for

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,960
them

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,880
um they didn't necessarily have to

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,559
like worry about all the added

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,080
complexity just do whatever is easier

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,520
for them pick the best product and just

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,520
run it right for us

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,159
having to be able to build a solution

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,159
that works across all of

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,840
you know the whatever whatever cloud

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,600
provider you pick in the world whatever

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,120
country picking world whatever on-prem

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,559
thing you pick in the world

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,799
um has kind of i guess maybe

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,960
not leveled the playing field but forced

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,720
us to to build better solutions that

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
that work across a wider range of use

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
cases

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,399
and i think there's a couple of things

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,440
also going on that are forcing the

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,240
trucks right there's

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,440
one it's just uh the classic the volume

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,760
and scale of data right

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,200
organizations are now starting to think

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
how do we manage this data

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,039
at the largest scale that we have them

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,559
it isn't a data warehouse or controlled

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,120
by a vendor anymore right

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,120
you have a lot of data coming in so how

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,799
do we apply these policies at scale and

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,640
how do we scale out the tools and the

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,159
processes to support it

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,919
and the second one is just the amount of

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,519
data coming in right in the past when

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,480
you had structured data warehouses and

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
databases

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,760
you had data coming in a very structured

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,159
format you know exactly where it was

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,080
going

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
in a table or a column you don't anymore

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,960
right it could go anywhere from a text

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,679
file to csv

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,279
to whatever image user uploads now just

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,679
the variety of data has grown

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,200
so much that they are realizing it isn't

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,760
a single clue that can solve it you have

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,440
to have

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,279
multiple tools that and then have to

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,279
collaborate to make a solution happen

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,240
okay yeah um

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,799
we answer quite a few of the questions i

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,640
think you've pretty much run through

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,039
most of the ones i've prepared

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,399
i had a question which uh which i was

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,360
about which is

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,000
we hear a lot about um you know your

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,440
your

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,720
your cfo or your ceo or your chief risk

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,159
office or whatever

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,320
um getting involved because there's now

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,039
liability at the board level

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,440
um for you know for making sure that

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,880
your data governance is is managed

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,200
how much um do we do we think that they

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,480
they care about the technology obviously

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,159
they want things

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,760
automated are we seeing pressure from

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,840
that direction at all

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
do they care about open source do you

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,440
see what i mean because

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,200
often you'd expect the decisions around

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,919
this sort of thing to be a to be a level

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
down

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,679
but if the board really cares how how

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,960
much they're getting involved is that

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,840
something anyone can can talk about

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
i have no idea

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,960
i know that um some of the

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,640
at some companies it is at the board

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
level it is on the p l level

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,760
right where they're tracking it as well

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,120
um

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,519
i'm not sure the what the connection to

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,200
the the open source is right but it is i

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,279
know something that

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,279
it's becoming more and more aware and i

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,720
think mike you bring up a really good

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,679
point because i think with the

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,399
with now covet i think privacy and

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,480
security

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,720
is at the forefront of everyone's mind

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,880
right everyone is going to the doctor

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,559
right whether you want to or not you

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,840
hear about it you know well you know how

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,600
are they going to attract to make sure

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
that i'm six feet away from someone or

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,840
how

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,279
what how is my information gonna be

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,000
protected and what are they gonna do

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,320
with this

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,519
analysis now if i got tested right so i

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
think

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,200
that everything is just really starting

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,240
to bubble up and i think

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,279
privacy got kind of a wave and with gdpr

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,519
three years ago

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,480
and now you're on this wave now with

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,120
with kobed

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,519
right with hey it's even more important

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,679
now

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,880
and you know it's so important that you

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,760
know individual

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
states within the us are now considering

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,159
you know

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,080
okay well what do we want to think about

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,440
with hipaa do we want to put that with

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,440
you know some components of that with

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
ccpa or do we want to put components of

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,960
that with something else

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,720
it's a different conversation right than

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,880
it ever has been before

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,879
and i think until you see enforcement in

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,679
that area it won't become real

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,560
right but i know that some companies are

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,560
putting on their piano

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,560
and mike again it's a discussion point

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,560
like you said i don't think we have an

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,320
answer but

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,320
do they care for the technology part do

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,639
they care i think it's it's not about

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,560
the technology pieces they care but

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,679
in my view being open source gives you

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
an extra level of

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,359
security right so you have the multiple

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,159
eyes you can get thing at that same code

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,520
base which

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,800
certainly if you're a board member you

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,040
would rather have something that's been

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,440
widely accepted that your peers have

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,119
accepted and looked at so that aspect is

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,119
where i think open source is at the top

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,960
of the mind all the way up to the cxo

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,280
level or even the board level

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
is that multiple is issue right and and

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,800
the second area where open source is uh

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,720
up to the reminders it's just

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,079
extending it is easy right if you have a

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,200
specific use case in your company

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,599
because you're in a slightly

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,280
differently regulated industry it's easy

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,000
to get pulled on an open source project

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,680
and add stuff

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
in there to suit your industry it's not

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,320
so easy for a proprietary software i

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,920
think that's where also

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
boards do is i mean boards and cxos look

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,320
at

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,079
monday for a year or two down the lane

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,920
they plan for strategy right and and

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,079
the tools need to support those amanda

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,599
operations or extensions are easy enough

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,480
and i think that's where open source is

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,480
gaining mind share

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,079
justine yeah i mean you mentioned

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,680
covered

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,359
uh jamie there was a uh a case uh last

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,839
week or so where

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,200
eighteen thousand covert patients all of

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,680
the coveted positive

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,720
patients in wales which is part of the

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,280
uk

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,960
uh pii personally identifiable

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,000
identified by information was was

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,280
released by accident

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,880
as a big breach uh and you know that

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,480
the thing about that is of course those

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,000
they may have other underlying health

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,440
conditions they may have other

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,280
you know genetic or other um

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,760
other conditions or other information

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,760
which is unrelated to cover but is now

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,359
being released as well and you know it

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,960
it really does bring to the full you're

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,560
right we we need to be thinking about

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,480
these things and it's not just

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,680
companies it's governments it's it's

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,119
it's charities

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,160
um i'm aware of an organization and not

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,359
not uh anything to do with with red hat

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,880
i should point out

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,480
where they had a they have a

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,240
whistleblowing policy

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,480
and um they

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,359
all good stuff and someone was searching

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,839
for the um the whistleblowing policy

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,960
on their internal intranet and found not

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,599
only the policy

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,119
but all the cases of whistleblowing with

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,839
all of the information and

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,960
all of the details of how it had been

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,320
managed and

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,000
that is the sort of thing you really

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,320
don't want to be happening right and

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,280
it's these are very different types of

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,960
cases

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
but they're they're what we should be

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
worrying this um

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,160
and which i hope folks like you can can

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,359
sort out yeah that'd be great

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,440
so so might i think you've been

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,880
interested in a topic that the direction

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,119
that we can take the conversation is

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,640
uh so till now we've been focused on the

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
front end right how do we make sure we

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
respect the security laws the privacy

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,000
aspects and the privacy which is of

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,040
individuals but you bring up a good

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,440
point so what about

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,960
post breach i mean these things happen

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,720
as we have seen right so once there is a

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,079
bridge once things get out

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,760
what are some things we could do both

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,599
from the the the

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,440
the software automation aspect of it and

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,680
even from the processes side

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,119
to contain the amount of damage that's

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,760
happening or how can we contain the

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,200
blast

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,200
radius once there's a breach

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,040
one of the most um gear

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,480
so one of the most important criteria

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,119
that we focus on in building out

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,119
solutions is auditability right when

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,560
when a breaches happen you need to know

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,800
what has happened and what this

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,000
the scope is that's that's kind of box

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,839
number one that we're trying to

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
check is with with the solution we're

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,160
building together with all these tools

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,680
how can we know

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,680
who accessed what data when

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,599
yeah and this is this is tricky stuff i

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,480
i don't have

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,240
you know we don't have ways to white

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,839
people's memories or wipe all the

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,800
machines that things have gone to

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,359
i'm kind of pleased to say i guess um i

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,400
think there

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,240
are some um techniques

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,000
from cryptography and the world of

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,920
sort of certificate management around

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,720
revocation that we should be thinking

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,760
about

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,040
now what can we revoke are there can we

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,640
it doesn't stop things being uh exposed

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,240
but if you can revoke

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,280
access or you can um you can make it

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,880
clear that thing

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,160
that things are not um certified or

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,119
whatever

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,359
it's it's really hard but i think we we

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,480
need to think about some of these time

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,800
specific capabilities maybe you know

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,240
we should be removing data you know

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,920
these days we want to keep data for as

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,480
long as possible but there are occasions

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,480
actually

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,920
when removing and deleting data is the

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
right thing to do

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
um you know just because we've got the

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,760
space to keep it

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,119
doesn't mean we should yeah and i think

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,119
understanding the why

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,520
right i mean breaches happen because

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,599
it's human error most of the time right

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,680
and just understanding you know why

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
why did that happen right and why did

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,079
why was that a good idea at the time

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,760
because what it may

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,280
have been a good idea three years ago is

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,560
not a good idea today

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,200
right um and i think you know just being

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,200
um just a trust and transparency right

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,480
making sure that you are

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,640
you know saying hey this is what we're

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,839
doing this is you know these are the

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,520
steps that we're following

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,960
and i think that goes a long way of

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,280
rebuilding your brand

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,680
and relationships because that really is

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,240
is what it comes down to is how

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,200
are you going to be that trusted partner

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,880
um

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,720
you know once this does happen and

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,320
customers then have the assurances that

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,079
hey hey they do have those controls in

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,000
place i feel good about it

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,599
um you know this is how we kind of all

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,240
came together and moved forward so i

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,079
think

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,240
you know that's that's the other side of

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,240
it

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,079
so and that raises another question

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,319
maybe we don't have much time which is

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,560
that are

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,319
our consumers getting blase are they

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,079
getting oh

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,680
stuff leaks all the time should they be

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,160
more worried about

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,119
leaks yeah i mean especially with your

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,240
cobit example

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,480
right i mean i can't imagine just from a

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,760
discrimination standpoint or all the

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,079
things that could happen with that

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,599
right i just you know i think people do

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,560
care i think it does matter

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,480
it is is it is in the news right daily

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,520
and i think it does

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,000
impact consumers choices as well right

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,599
it's the

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,880
whole trust thing right am i going to

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,760
really want to do business with a

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,400
company that just

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,200
exposed my credit card probably not

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,440
right

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,800
um you know especially if i hear that

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,040
it's a repeat

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
right breach you know that's where i

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,359
think it becomes

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,359
really um a bad situation

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,839
the thing that excites me about open

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,680
source is i think it's creating

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,880
those choices for people you know people

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,520
don't want to feel like they're locked

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,800
in

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,640
they don't trust somebody but there's no

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:20,160
alternative i think with open source

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:20,800
we're creating alternatives lot of

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,440
interesting

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,240
interesting discussion here uh folks uh

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,839
thanks for your time

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,520
um we have like a minute or two left um

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,119
but we i mean i'm finally calling it

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,720
right now just a little

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,800
just as a general announcement for

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,560
everyone here um

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,839
we have i think roughly 35 minutes

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,640
um between uh well for lunch now

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,359
so the next set of sessions will be

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,560
starting

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,319
at 12 50 eastern time which is

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,599
converted to your time zone i think

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,680
schedule that sched lets you do that

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,400
so yeah yeah thanks done guys for

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
hopping on to this

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,240
and and please please come along to the

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,359
session i'm uh

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,640
co-leading uh at uh ten past five on an

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,400
art which will tell you

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,560
about a very specific technology i'll

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,160
just plug that thanks niche for uh for

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,440
leading us to it's been fun folks thanks

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,520
folks and thanks for

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,839
reading the discussion everyone thanks

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,839
everyone

00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,079
