well jen is recommending that we make it

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,879
started

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,920
i think that's reasonable does we'll

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,200
just go ahead and start introducing

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
ourselves so

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,960

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,320
my name is brian proffitt i am a manager

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,840
on the community outreach team within

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
the open source program office

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
i'm brian behrenshausen also from the

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,000
open source program office at red hat

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
uh i'm a community architect and i work

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,840
on

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,840
enablement materials uh in hospital

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,680
hey i'm brendan conoboy i'm a project

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
manager people manager engineer

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,559
inside our engineering organization with

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,039
a special focus on

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,039
rail and everything before and after it

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,960
so we all come at uh community and

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
uh project management and all of those

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
things from a little bit different

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,360
angles but this is a q a so if there are

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
folks with questions go ahead and drop

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
them in chat tell us

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:27,840
who you are what you're interested in

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:27,840
hearing about

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,240
so hina says uh so everything relevant

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,840
oh that's a terrible pun i just picked

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,840
up on that

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:55,840
we have 15 folks watching so please

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:55,840
speak up and ask your questions

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
while we wait for people to ask some

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
questions uh brian

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,560
with a b we have this problem all the

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,920
time why don't you tell us what's new

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
with the open or community because some

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,319
things have changed since maybe people

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,319
have heard about it last

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:20,560
uh assuming i'm brian with a b i will

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
gladly uh gladly answer that question

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
brian

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
so uh i work with a great upstream uh

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
community project

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,160
called the open organization project uh

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
and um i think it's a great example of a

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
way

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,560
that the open source uh development

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,959
model and the open source community

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
model can be applied to

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,560
um projects that aren't necessarily

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
related to software development

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
so um and i'll tell you a little bit

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
about it what we've been working on

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
and encourage you to get started um some

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,000
folks on the call might know that

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,000
um about five years ago the then ceo red

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
hat now president of ibm

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,599
jim whitehurst wrote a book called the

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,440
open organization which is really about

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,640
uh red hat and the way that uh red hat's

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,720
genesis in open source uh led

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,480
to an interesting organizational culture

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,760
and an interesting organizational

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,680
model and you know several people have

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,920
asked and so jim wrote the book

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
about the way that open principles the

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,360
same principles on which

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,480
many of the um most productive and

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
innovative

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,080
uh open source communities across the

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
globe are are

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
couched in uh how those can be applied

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,799
to an organization

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,480
any organization uh and that book uh

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
when it debuted sparked a community

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
conversation that five years later still

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
continues

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,360
and that conversation concerns all the

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
ways that the

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
that open principles principles like

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,360
transparency

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,920
collaboration inclusivity the way these

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
principles can be the bedrock of not

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
just an open source software community

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
but any organization

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
organizational model and the community

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
has extended that conversation in the

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,959
form of a book series taking jim's

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,040
original book and extending it into a

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,080
series of books

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,159
has continues to maintain a definition

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,799
of an open organization that anyone can

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,639
use

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,959
and produce creative commons licensed

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
articles uh and other resources that

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,520
anyone can use to try to figure out

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,040
how they can leverage open principles in

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
their organization even if they're not

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
an open source software company and even

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
if they're not

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,840
an open source community um but we use

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,199
uh open source platforms and methods

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,840
uh to govern our community right so we

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,360
um you know all our books are developed

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
on github

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,400
our meetings take place in the open and

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,040
we have a community on discourse

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,639
we we continue to license our materials

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,960
via creative commons and so while our

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,080
community does not necessarily produce

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,280
open code we produce open resources in

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
the spirit that the

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,199
communities who produce that open code

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
make their stuff in right so

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,919
um i encourage you to come check us out

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
if you are a non-technical contributor

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
to open source

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
but really want to understand and tell

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
others about the ways that open

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
principles can make a difference

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,160
outside of software development you can

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
check us out at theopenorganization.org

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,639
and if you want to interact with our

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,360
community come to the

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,360
openorganization.community

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
and leave us a note we'd love to love to

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,759
talk to you

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
awesome thanks is that the pitch that

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
was cool

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
uh drop your link in the chat too for

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,960
everyone

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
and while you do that so we have a few

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,919
questions popping up neil i'm gonna come

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
back to your question i'm gonna skip it

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,199
for now because we're hoping that jen

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
who is particularly an expert will be

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,840
able to join and have audio

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,320
so i will go to the next question are

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,440
there any tips and processes that you

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,520
all would recommend

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,039
non-open source projects and companies

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,520
start adopting as tools for their

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
success

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,600
i assume that means uh in the direction

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,840
of doing things more openly although

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,840
that may not be where they are now

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,720
correct all right should we just round

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,800
robin this one

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,759
yeah go all right i'll take the first

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
step which is

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,440
stop being secretive about everything

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,600
like it's it's not

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
actually valuable all you're doing is

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
impeding progress

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
and slowing yourself down unless you're

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,680
in a place where you need to slow

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,080
yourself down

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
secrets are just harmful because as soon

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
as a decision is made or information

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
is out there then there are people that

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,160
have it people who don't have it and

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
then they can't make good decisions

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
together

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,479
so like for like to to share

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,680
information openly and to share

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,080
information

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
in the decision making process openly is

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,599
a faster way to get

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,639
better decisions with everybody bought

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,680
in and

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,280
like the failure to do that is is

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,479
i don't know it is a source of so much

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,000
strife so just stop being secretive

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
yeah we have an easy three word phrase

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
for that default to open yeah

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,800
everything's open unless you have a

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
really really good reason that it's not

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,039
much agreed uh i've done a lot of

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,120
government projects and even military

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,319
projects and they're even finding ah

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
welcome jen

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
they're even finding that secrets slow

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
things down and are harmful even for

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,960
their use so

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
it really gives a message to other

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
organizations that have an easier road

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
to hoe

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,000
any other thoughts on that i think

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,560
beyond the upstream first and default to

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,880
open

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,599
um philosophies um i think

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
from uh from a tool side of pragmatic

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,080
side

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
definitely try to do a lot of your work

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,879
on tools that allow for

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,080
open collaboration um

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,120
whether that's get lab or github or

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,400
you know something that you know changes

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,440
can be made

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,759
in public that can be seen and and

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
definitely have a policy in place where

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,960
you allow

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,080
outside contributions um you know from

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,560
from outside your organization don't

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,599
don't be an organization that will you

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
know like like

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,280
that basically just says okay we're open

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,800
but really nobody's

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,319
we're not going to let any new

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,759
contributions in

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,199
um so that's certainly a key

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,599
to doing you know beyond you know

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,319
applying your work in the upstream first

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,640
actually

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
working on tools that everybody can

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,440
where the work can be seen

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,120
one of the things i think we learn about

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
collaboration from open source

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,680
communities is a really interesting

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,599
dynamic that i think

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,720
any organization or any group or team

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
can adopt

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
and it's as simple as uh starting with

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
collaboration first right not

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
the model of that's more common what i

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,080
would call

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
uh like sort of ad collaboration and

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
stir right so think of like every

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,760
project you've done like in school or

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,279
with a group project where it's like oh

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
we need to collaborate on this okay so

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,240
if you do this part

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
and you do this part and you do this

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,600
part and you do this part and then like

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
you know a week before the project we'll

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
bring them all together and like mash

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
them up

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
and see how they work together right not

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
an effective method of collaboration

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,279
necessarily it's sort of what i call

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,160
ag collaboration and stir right but the

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,160
way uh

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,680
the way open source projects work is

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,920
somewhat different right they

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
begin projects together every project

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
every initiative

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
begins as a collaborative effort by

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,240
default right so just as something might

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,480
be open and transparent by default it

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
can be collaborative by default where

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,920
people are working in the same thing or

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
on the same thing and in the same

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,760
direction

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,680
and at the same time and instead of

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
having a bunch of pieces that ultimately

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
come together

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
in the end or a bunch of individual

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,959
interests that ultimately get subsumed

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
into a whole

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
you have the other dynamic where you

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,880
have a group that's collaborating by

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
default and then

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
forking only when their um needs differ

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
like when when

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
when these when you know differences

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,360
appear right and and and

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,360
guess what the more you work together

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,240
the more you realize that forking is an

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
anomaly

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
right that those divergent paths are

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
actually unnecessary

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
in most cases that most people's uh ends

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,200
are the same

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,200
uh and so you get a really interesting

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
um model of collaboration

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,440
out of uh the open source uh methodology

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,120
that i think anybody can adopt and and

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,519
just to see success with

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,760
um i'll put in the chat a link to a book

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
that the open organization community has

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
continues to maintain it's called the

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,040
open organization workbook

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
and it's a book that takes the open

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
organization definition one of the

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,200
principles of which is

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,600
collaboration and offers exercises

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
and case studies that you can read and

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
study and enact with your team to kind

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
of

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
leverage the the principle from the open

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,320
source way

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
into uh your organization even if you're

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
not building code right so there's some

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
great exercises around for example

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
collaboration in here

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,560
that don't necessarily involve

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,079
collaborating on code but take lessons

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,440
we learn from open source communities

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,560
and open source projects

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
and help uh and help um insinuate them

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,640
in

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,000
organizations of all kinds and all sizes

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,000
i'll put that in the chat if it's useful

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,640
all right i was going to rock

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
thoughtfully about how difficult this is

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
in

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
an organization that doesn't use or

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
contribute to open source in any way

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
except i think brian gave you the answer

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,160
which is

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,519
we have entire books and websites and

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,200
resources about this so there you go

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,839
and it sounds like jen has audio do i

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,120
have audio

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,040
seriously seriously hop in too um

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,880
it seems like it seized my chrome

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,279
browser and then didn't

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,839
didn't want to release me from a

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,000
circular wheel of death if you would

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,760
um so thank thanks so much for being

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,519
patient to everybody and i'm sorry that

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
i wasn't here to introduce myself in the

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
beginning

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,959
i am uh jen krieger chief ageless in the

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,639
protestant technologies division

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,320
uh at red hat and i see that there are a

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,360
bunch of questions in chat keep them

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
coming in

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
and i think the one that came in first

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,560
that we

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
we didn't answer immediately was uh how

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
do you help bring community into agile

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,880
development processes

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,959
um i'm assuming you skipped over it

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,920
because i wasn't around

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,360
yeah so here you are go and it's like i

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
also realized that i

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
invited um my team to come and ask any

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
question

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
that they had regardless of what the

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,839
topic was so that might also

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,320
create a a little bit of a sideways

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,880
thing here um but honestly there was a

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,680
there was a really great talk earlier by

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
lee griffin

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,360
if you were not in that talk he he spent

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
like an hour

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
i feel like it was it was a long time

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,519
talking about how

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
the cpe team and the fedora community

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
has been

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,480
using internal agile techniques and how

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,399
they're trying to make them visible to

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,120
the external community

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,200
and i think uh a large portion of the

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,279
talk centered around

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,880
making sure that there was a human on

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,920
the other side of that

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
of that team you know perspective if you

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
would

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,680
that there was actually somebody on the

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
other side of that not just another

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
person

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
who's just writing code right um and i

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,279
really appreciated the perspective

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,399
because often times it's really easy to

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,320
to um especially in the internet to um

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
do this thing where we're just like we

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,920
don't really don't really take care

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
in the other person on the other side

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
because we don't have

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,000
we don't have that personal face-to-face

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,440
connection with them we don't have that

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,360
personal face-to-face

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,519
uh relationship if you would and

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
making sure that that comes across in

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
everything that we do

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,360
is is critical you can

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,279
go into the whole conversation about

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
how do you how do you have an upstream

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,920
community participate in a scrum

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,360
you know team when you know all the

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,040
ceremonies are internal and all that

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
kind of stuff i can i can go into those

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,959
details it's

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,440
super easy invite your community to them

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
right

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
um and ask them to participate that

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
there's not

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,680
there isn't magic there um but i think

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,839
that really has to be a wider

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,199
conversation with that team to decide

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,360
how do you want to bring them in

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,560
who do you want to bring them in how do

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,079
you know who the right people

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,639
are how do you make sure that that

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,240
community isn't going to send like an

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,199
army of a thousand people to this

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,720
meeting and only one of those people are

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,079
really the people that

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
your opinion is the one that you should

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,959
listen to um like i said lee griffin's

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,639
talk i'll put the link to it and chat if

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
actually if i could ask an organizer to

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
dig it up and put the link in that would

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
be great

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,199
uh but but he had some really great

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720
advice and i i would hate to steal his

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,360
thunder so i would recommend that you

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
watch us talk

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,120
any other comments brendan

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,279
do you have anything you'd like to add i

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,480
don't think i can add to that

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,199
here fair enough um

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,959
all right moving on uh this one is

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,560
directly for brendan

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,240
what has been a few of your biggest

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,519
lessons learned from your last two years

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,920
working with the rel team

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,920
oh yeah i'm not sure where to start uh

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,680
there's only one of me and there are

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,199
hundreds and thousands of them

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,279
so it's important to

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,560
empower people to do the work on their

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,000
own instead of being an

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,000
interface for them probably a good one

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,680
also it's always more complex than i

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,560
think it is

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,480
and where process is concerned everybody

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,480
wants to make it more complex than it

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
has to be

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
so do to the maximum extent possible we

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,800
want to make

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
things very short very concise and very

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,199
intuitive

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,519
a lot of the time people will invent

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,360
processes for themselves and their team

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,880
and they'll be this very elaborate and

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,519
constrictive thing

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,720
and they kind of forget the difference

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
between

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
what they're trying to get to and how

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,759
they're trying to get there and

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,279
they end up designing a very elaborate

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
thing that

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,560
it's not recyclable and then they're

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,320
very unhappy because they try to go

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,560
through all the steps and then they lose

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
heart because they never can get through

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
it and like the thing they had in mind

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
that one time

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,720
worked and then they try to do it again

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,959
and it doesn't work anymore so

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,600
simplicity and and um

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,800
recovery recognizing when things don't

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,920
aren't working

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,040
and and reinventing the wheel as often

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,880
as needed to

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,639
use suit which is probably the first

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,199
time you did it it didn't it was not the

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,720
best

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,160
that could have been done

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,519
awesome thanks brendan all right next

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,320
question

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,399
from hina how do you find the balance

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,480
between making a decision and continuing

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,320
to gather feedback

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
sometimes this feels like keeping ideas

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,600
open for feedback can go on forever

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,399
um and limit moving forward who would

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,639
like to

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,040
take a stab at that one all right mr

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,519
profit

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,439
so i've actually been doing some

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,919
training about this all week

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,079
so it's fresh on my mind so

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
at red hat what we do internally and

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
also we try to

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,480
do this with the projects that we

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,559
steward um we

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,400
we use a technique called open

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,880
management practices

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,640
and also related to that the open

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,520
decision framework

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,319
and i won't really go into that because

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
it's huge

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,720
um but the gist of it is

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,679
that you let as many people participate

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
in

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,200
decisions as is reasonable

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,080
and have as much collaboration as you

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,520
can

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,640
but as a manager you also

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,039
can't let that link what what you

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,720
describe as the endless feedback loop or

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,080
you know bike shedding or whatever you

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,039
want to call it

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,760
you can't let that go on so the the way

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
around that

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,039
is you know what we do is we try to set

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,280
boundaries

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
on the decision and those boundaries

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,520
might be

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,400
you know we have x amount of time we

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,200
you know we have x amount of budget um

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
you know

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,039
these are the constraints with which we

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,240
have to make a decision

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,520
and so you you know you listen to

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,720
ideas you move you know towards or away

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
from ideas

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,720
but at the end of the day you've set up

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,039
a boundary that says okay but by this

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
time we have to have a decision made

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,480
and so that's how you sort it and you

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
can do this in an open source project

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,120
too

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,400
um you just define the limits of the

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,320
discussion

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,000
um and then and then go from there

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
some teams in red hat also use what's

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,200
called the racy model so the r

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
is you define one person who is

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
responsible and has to ultimately make

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
the decision

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
and the a is other folks who may be

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,760
accountable for that decision

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,520
but one person has to be responsible and

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,200
then the c and the i are people who are

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,480
consulted and informed that larger

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
stakeholder community

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
who should be consulted who should be

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,280
informed who should be a part of it but

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
who did not ultimately have to make the

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
choice

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,200
and i think it's also important to

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,120
remember that

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,480
consensus does not mean unanimous

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,480
agreement

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
so just because everyone doesn't have

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,440
the same opinion doesn't mean that you

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
don't have to eventually put a stake in

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,280
something and move along

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,440
i love that ruth because we we use that

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,000
internally in the rel team we say we

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
don't

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
we don't need consensus we don't need

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,799
everybody to say yes we need consent

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,520
meaning who who actually owns this

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,760
decision

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
and are you going to actually allow them

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,480
to make it because that is their area of

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
expertise

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,880
and it's been it's been quite a learning

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,640
journey for folks internally

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
uh to to really know the difference

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
between those two

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,520
ideas really yeah but i just want to

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,600
plus one what brian said because

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
so often we fall in love with ideas and

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
the pursuit of

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,320
the perfect plan and whatnot it's like

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
no there have to be constraints there

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
has to be

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,320
a time limit there has to be something

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
that causes you say okay

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,440
this is what we're going to do and even

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
if it's not perfect it's what we're

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
going to do

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,000
at least for now we can revisit it later

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,080
but without constraints

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,159
uh it actually stifles creativity like

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,640
having constraints makes people creative

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,760
and it gets you to a decision in the end

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,240
so it's very important

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,520
how do you uh brendan elaborate on the

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
how do you limit

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,440
like when do you know to cut off

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,919
you just give them a time window well

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
maybe

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,320
i mean so let's say you're you're a

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,600
co-equal member of a community and and

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,799
you want to do something different in

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
the community and you need the community

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,280
consent

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,520
and say okay i want to do this but i i

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,679
like i can only do it if we can reach a

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,880
decision by this point in time

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,720
and then if that point is reached and

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,679
we can't get to an agreement like well i

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
guess i won't do this and i won't

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,360
participate

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
so you know it there there's a there's a

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
little bit of

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
a give and take dynamic here because

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,400
it's like you can force community

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,080
members to do things

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,600
but you can definitely say i'm going to

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
put my energy into this

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
if you'll do it with me and i'm not

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,559
going to put my energy into this if you

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,520
won't do it with me and so

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,520
the choice is yours

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:20,080
fair all right next question

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,679
this is uh for brian b um

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,280
i'm not going to try to pronounce your

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,159
last name brian because i think i know

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,000
how to

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,679
but i don't want to make the mistake

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,919
right um

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
to me there are dangers with relying on

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,200
meritocracy with it

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
sometimes being about people rather than

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,480
making sure the best idea services

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
what advice do you have

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,080
wow okay uh got the heavy hitter i got

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
the heavy one no that's great i really

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,520
appreciate the question honestly because

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,039
meritocracy is one of the most

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,280
fascinating concepts to me

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,640
in um open source open source culture in

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,360
fact just an hour ago i was reading a

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,120
new

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,720
uh book on meritocracy and i have

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,799
another one downstairs i've written

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
about meritocracy as a concept and

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,400
from historical perspective for

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,400
opensource.com and i love talking about

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,440
it so i really appreciate the question

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,679
so at the core meritocracy or popular

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
deployments of meritocracy we'll say are

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
two

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,240
fundamental ideas that are always

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,799
intentioned one is that the best ideas

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,480
can

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,559
should always win and the best ideas

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,960
come from anywhere right so

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,480
the again in open source communities and

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
in open organizations you often hear

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,159
that sentiment the best idea should win

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,640
regardless of where it came from

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,760
and uh the idea that solves the problem

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
best solves it

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,840
for the most people and solves it in the

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,280
most effective or elegant way should win

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,080
and then uh that's also uh put up put up

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
against another

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,360
um sort of maxim meritocratic maxim

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,840
which is

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
um you know those who do the work those

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,880
who have a

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,080
the longest uh history of demonstrated

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
contribution

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,600
should have more say right those who

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,240
have accrued the most merit

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,679
uh in other words should be able to make

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
the decisions right and so

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,120
in order to have a say in a process you

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,240
need to demonstrate a history of

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,240
successful contribution

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,039
right because it uh if for the former to

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
be true the best ideas can come from

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,120
anywhere and it shouldn't matter who you

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,480
are

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,000
that means it shouldn't matter how many

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,200
decisions you've made or not made or how

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,720
many of your ideas have worked in the

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
past you should have a fair shot every

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
time

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,159
and the opposite is true right if you

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,960
have a history of demonstrated

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,559
contribution in a

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,280
open source community or an open source

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,400
project uh your idea should matter more

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,120
right so you have these two competing uh

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,640
maxims meritocratic maxims in any

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,640
governance model that's predicated on

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,840
meritocracy as a guiding principle

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,360
so you have to figure out in your

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,760
project how you're going to negotiate

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
those

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,440
right and every project is different

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,320
every project negotiates that tension

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,240
differently

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,159
um but your question was specifically

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,919
about the focus on ideas as opposed to

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,240
people and that is i think the tension

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,919
right that is the tension uh where you

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
have people who have accrued merit over

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
the years and now

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,320
those folks have a louder voice right

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
when linus fourvold speaks

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,840
things happen in ways that do not happen

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,880
when other people speak

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,000
and uh also the focus on ideas right the

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,919
id the notion that

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,919
uh the best idea should not be the

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
loudest idea the most tenured idea the

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
most senior idea the idea that's higher

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,640
up is

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,919
highest up in the hierarchy right so you

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,919
have to figure out in your project how

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,760
you're gonna negotiate those tensions

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,039
um i don't have the magic formula

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,400
unfortunately if so i wouldn't be on

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,679
this call i'd be writing the next book

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,520
on meritocracy but

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,799
i leave you with that tension as a

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
framework to think through

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,840
as you explore that with your own

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,240
project

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,080
it also means that you have to divine

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,679
when someone says on a mailing list this

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,600
project is a meritocracy

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,520
which version of that word they mean

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
which which end of that spectrum they

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,279
think

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,960
uh the project is working on uh great

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,960
i mean it also means that you have to

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,120
have a psychologically safe project and

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,760
community because it might be that only

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
the

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
best most meritous idea that somebody

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,120
has expressed

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,679
is out there and people don't feel safe

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,559
to put out an opposing view

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,120
so it like there's that second dynamic

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,799
of

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,720
creating a space where people actually

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,720
will bring out their best

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,520
junior audio is gone again watch your

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,120
mic again

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
seriously thank you don't say anything

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,200
bad

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,760
don't i'm not going to i was going to um

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,360
but i

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,000
i'm not going to um

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,679
so hina asks do you run into occasions

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
where community members try to go their

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,320
way regardless of the decision that was

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,679
made

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,279
and i'm assuming there's probably a

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:43,840
follow-up on that which is like the

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:46,799
whispered what should we do about it

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,679
i believe we already covered forks yeah

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,919
i mean

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
we kind of did i mean it's going to be a

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,080
fork

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,440
um and as brendan said sometimes you

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,200
just have to say if you're not going to

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,520
put the energy into this then

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,440
[Music]

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,039
yeah that's what you're going to do it's

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,039
unfortunate but it happens

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
all right what do you do if the loudest

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,559
idea is always the thing that gets the

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,880
most attention

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,679
how do you give the silent but brilliant

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,799
people a voice

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,559
on um so on those uh open management

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,200
practices that i mentioned earlier one

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,480
of

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,960
you do is you do try

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,880
to get everybody's opinion

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,240
um because yes when you're in a room

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
there's always going to be the person

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,960
who's going to jump in and speak up

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,480
first

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,039
they're going to be the loudest and so

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,640
um when that happens you have to kind of

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,279
eyeball the room

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
um real or virtual and see okay well

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,840
who's being quiet

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,000
and make sure that you've asked for

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,279
unsolicited

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,960
their opinion as well um and you have to

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,240
work at that somebody actually

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,000
has to do that work and and try to draw

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,200
that out and it can be hard because

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,200
people have

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,360
different um there's different

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,440
neurodiversities

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,799
uh there's introversion versus

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,840
extroversion there's a whole bunch of

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,039
things in there

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,240
so that's part of the the process

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,720
that a community architect has to do is

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,120
to

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,600
sort of gather everybody's opinion and

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,120
make sure everybody has a voice

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,880
and on this different comfort zone okay

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,880
go ahead go for it

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,159
i'm needing i would just add to that um

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,440
you know from a project management

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
perspective or from an open source

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,600
community management

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,240
perspective the trick is to ensure that

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,440
your

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,080
project offers multiple modes uh of

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,399
feedback

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,399
multiple channels for feedback right in

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,600
multi multiple media or multiple modes

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,760
right that means

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,440
uh accommodating people who might not

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
speak up on the community call

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,880
the the synchronous community call but

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
who are typists and love to sit down and

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,360
think through stuff

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,960
right that means having a live chat

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,960
option available to folks who might not

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
be the best typists or might not or who

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
for whom english might not be their

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,279
first language

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,799
or you know the the project's dominant

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
language might not be their their first

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,600
language and so

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,960
they're they're not going to be able to

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,399
write their feedback as well as they'll

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,039
be able to express it to you face to

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,520
face

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,039
right so the the trick is to create a

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,919
project create a team create an

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,440
environment where

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,520
feedback can come through a variety of

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,039
channels and it also means tailoring

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,760
your decision-making process

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,799
to processes to um accommodating those

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
channels right

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,279
making sure that if you're gonna um you

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,679
know render a decision that you leave

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,240
enough time for people to think who are

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,799
uh processors who like to you know type

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
up uh

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,240
notes and come back to you with a brief

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,279
not demand decisions

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,399
be made immediately but also um

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,399
open up enough uh of the channel uh

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,840
open up enough of a space that folks can

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,120
have a lively debate and come to an

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,640
agreement at the end of that debate if

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,399
they need to right so

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,760
uh historically we've seen the most

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,240
successful projects

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,520
that are best at recruiting the best

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
ideas are the ones that have multiple

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,760
modes

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,840
multiple channels for multiple modes of

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,240
feedback

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,080
yeah the the best story i have for that

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,080
is um when i was a scrum master for a

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,120
team like many many years ago

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,120
um the team was all in the room and

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,880
five out of six of the engineers were

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,880
all very comfortable with

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,679
talking out loud thinking out loud if

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,559
you would and one of them

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,159
definitely did not think out loud and we

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,080
were talking about a direction we wanted

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,600
to go from an architecture perspective

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,679
and the five engineers were all

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,159
collaborating all collaborating

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,000
and when they turned to get feedback

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,159
from that sixth engineer

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
he he was completely in his own head

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,760
thinking about the first question and

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
they had already gone forward

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,279
in the conversation like 30 minutes and

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,640
he had missed

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,399
most of what they were talking about

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,120
because he was like

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,399
well okay the message bus if we choose

00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,279
this one you know and he was going

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,120
through this

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,200
like oh and this is the implication and

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,960
the server over here oh yeah i forgot

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,080
that i didn't update the configuration

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,960
setting over there

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,799
and the way he was thinking was so far

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
away from where the other people were

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,039
thinking that by the time they

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,399
kind of tried to coalesce he had no idea

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,640
what was going on

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,320
and so another thing that i think is

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,520
really important is to

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,760
make sure that those loud forward

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,559
pushing thinkers especially if you're if

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,600
you're in a

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,279
face-to-face meeting or or like a

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,320
conversation make sure everybody's along

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,640
for the ride

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,440
and constantly check in with people you

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,679
can do

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,919
check-in statements like i think i heard

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,760
this are we all on the same page or

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,600
what what am i missing or have i

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,080
restated that incorrectly

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,000
to kind of put a flag in a meeting to

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
say okay we need to make sure everybody

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,320
is all on the same page

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,320
that's all or even i've heard from the

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,679
same five voices for the last half hour

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,880
i need to hear from three new voices

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,000
before we move on

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,039
yeah i i also do a little prep work

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,760
especially for some of the apparently um

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,279
if you all saw me laughing earlier

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,320
because carson was saying something very

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,679
funny in chat

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,960
and i i couldn't i couldn't keep my

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,840
laughter contained but if you

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,120
if you are struggling with individuals

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,000
and you know they're going to be in your

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,279
meeting

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,519
maybe you should have a conversation

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,000
with them before they get to the meeting

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,159
about making space for others

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,600
and in some cases even at red hat i will

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
call people out right directly

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
especially if i know that they're doing

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,679
it

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,519
and they know that they're doing it get

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,960
permission from them first but

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
there are a couple people at red hat

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,960
that i will always interrupt

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,720
and say phrases like let's make room for

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,039
others right there in the meeting

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,559
because they're okay with it and i need

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,080
to give them a clue

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,000
and so i think i think it's really

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,760
important that you do that

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,279
um and it and i think it's also really

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,600
important that you set

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,960
the intent before you do it because if

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,559
you're gonna do it some people might

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,240
feel like it's a smack

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,679
so make sure they understand what the

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,760
intent is by

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,120
by doing those types of activities

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,120
before you before you do them

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,760
okay

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,559
i think the next question is how do you

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,640
make people in open source draw pictures

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,000
instead of writing a man page

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,840
and i i think there's an elaboration

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,200
in there which also says i find that in

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,840
open source experience

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,080
people are used to doing work through

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,919
prs obviously which are very text based

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,039
but some of us are visual learners and

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,039
it's hard to grow

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,840
how do you make open source folks draw

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
pictures

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,279
let's say i've written man pages before

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:57,360
and that language is freaking awful so i

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,960
would rather draw a picture

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,120
i mean this is something that i used to

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,240
work on when i was working as a

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,760
with publishing way back when you would

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,559
make a book

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,360
that would be very text heavy and then

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,760
you would also

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,559
make books on the exact same technology

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,640
that had

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:19,039
pictures and easy step by steps so

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,720
so you know yes there are different

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,799
learning modalities for

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,000
for people uh depending on how they're

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,840
coming towards

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
it i i would say

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,360
this is tricky because when i first read

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,399
the question i thought

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:38,240
this is a question about how do we find

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,799
things in a community that um

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
aren't necessarily you know developer

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,279
oriented

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,600
and we have this discussion all the time

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,240
in our open source program office

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,440
we don't say that commun a community is

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,039
full of developers

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,960
we say a community is full of

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,080
contributors because there are

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,720
different ways to participate

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,519
but i get the sense it's not what neil

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,799
is asking

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,640
so i don't know

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,000
it's a hard question to answer without

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,320
maybe a specific example

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,119
or understanding uh exactly what the

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
problem was

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,800
i will say i can i can offer an anecdote

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,040
i've at least encouraged people to

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
to give visual diagrams with an example

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,079
when i used to do

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,000
a talk on the raspberry pi i would tell

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,599
people i don't care how you share what

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
you did as long as you share and my

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
example was

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,159
this wiring diagram i found on the

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,800
internet that was clearly a photo

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,119
somebody took

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,359
of their scribbles on a cocktail napkin

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,000
but it had all the information i needed

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,280
so

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,720
good enough for me

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,320
i think this really speaks to the

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,480
importance of having a

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,919
a diverse and heterogeneous mix of

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,560
people working on your project

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,079
and understanding that um you know the

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,760
value of a contribution

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,679
come you know a valuable contribution

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,639
comes in many forms there's nothing

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,320
necessarily

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,159
stopping a project from uh embedding for

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,720
example a youtube link

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,480
uh to its project and a whiteboard a

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,400
video of a whiteboard explanation of how

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,359
its project how the project works

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
in the readme file on github right or in

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
the readme file that somebody downloads

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,000
from

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,880
whatever um you know forge you're using

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,920
like

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,440
uh there's i mean it's it's

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
the question was how do you make people

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
do it i don't think you can make

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,960
you can make anybody do it but i think

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,400
what you can do is as a project lead

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,119
you can recognize the the limits of your

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,800
own

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,880
uh biases in terms of media types right

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,160
you know we we address this a lot in our

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,480
upstream community

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,079
uh when we're working with uh not just

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,160
you know pictures and video

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,480
and not just picture video but but sound

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,359
you know i mean people like to record

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,880
uh their audio clips of an explanation

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,040
of a concept rather than write it down

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,400
so how is your project going to

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,880
accommodate um people with

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,560
different you know accessibility needs

00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,200
really and different preferences

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,640
that's a great answer brian um we are

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,440
almost at a time we have about three

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,480
minutes left

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,440
and i would like to ask everybody

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,200
to using i think it's something like

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
probably a hundred years of combined

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,000
experience between

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,280
the uh presenters here uh what is one

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,040
tip that you'd want

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,320
somebody to know it could be really

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,640
anything and um

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,160
i know ruth has a really great one so

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,359
i'm gonna pick on her first

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
no i'm not going first because i'm

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,200
actually going to make it relevant so

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,079
somebody okay

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,720
fair enough but uh i i was uh chuckling

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,920
because i was

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,400
i was warning uh the presenters in

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
a chat channel and i and ruth's tip in

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,119
the chat was

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,800
always brown your butter before making

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,960
cookies which i agree with

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,079
and so she's she'll come back in a

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,800
second but

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,760
maybe i could ask brendan what is one

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,480
tip you like to share with everyone

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
oh goodness

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,160
whatever the thing is that you want to

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,640
do like

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,640
just go for it like the the more

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,599
enthusiasm you bring the more you want

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,520
to do it the more

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,520
valuable the more important it is that

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
you just do that you will regret not

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,960
doing things

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,920
so things that you desire the most go

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,680
for them

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,119
and and where community is concerned

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,920
that enthusiasm

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,760
it looks like leadership and the things

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,880
that you are the most enthusiastic about

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,880
are the things that other people will

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
also become enthusiastic about so

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,359
go for it share it and people will will

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,480
band behind you support you or you know

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,079
give you something even better to do

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,200
all right how about brian prophet

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,160
so the thing that i tell people

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,880
if you are participating in a project or

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,320
you are

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,680
an active voice in a project

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,040
in open source is to try to make your

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,560
onboarding

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,920
as simple as possible and we have three

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,000
tenants for this what does the project

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,200
do

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,119
how do you use the project and where do

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,000
you find the project

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,320
those three basic things if you can do

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
that

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,760
on your website or your github page or

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,320
wherever you're

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,520
you know wherever you talk to you know

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,200
people

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,440
if you can solve those three things

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,240
you've gone a long way than a lot of

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,680
even

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,720
current legacy open source projects um

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
have done so there you go it's a really

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,680
great tip

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,280
i often times have wished for that for

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,839
certain projects

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,839
all right brian b you're up

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,400
um i would say probably just

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,520
one of my one of my favorite reminders

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,440
is that

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,040
in an open source project as with most

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,200
things in life but especially in an open

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,320
source project or in a community

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,640
you are only as everyone is only as

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,560
strong as they empower each other to be

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,880
right uh and so you are only as good as

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,880
you

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,680
as you um enable others to be

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,079
and so i would say that as you as you

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
act

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,520
in a community as you build something as

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,240
you contribute something

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,359
as you tweak something as you offer

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,520
something remember that the spirit of

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,640
mutual growth is what should guide you

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,040
and that the spirit

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,560
of lifting others up is what should

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,920
guide you and that when you make a

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,760
contribution

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
the goal of a contribution should not

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
just be to

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
fix a bug for yourself or as folks say

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,079
scratch your own itch which is of course

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,000
important but

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,200
also you should be asking how is this

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,880
going to make something better for

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,079
someone else

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,240
and how uh is what i'm doing

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,280
empowering others to do better work in

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,760
the future awesome thank you brian

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
all right bruce go for it first of all i

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
love that at six o'clock on friday

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,599
brendan's laptop says no we're done here

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,680
and leaves she's kind of logged him

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,640
right off

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,000
so to make my tongue and cheek brown

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,640
your butter for your cookies

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,320
comment actually relevant there is a

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,839
metaphor we use to explain this whole

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,280
open source goodness thing which is that

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,240
if you make a batch of cookies for your

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,680
friends that's awesome

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,680
your friends get to enjoy those cookies

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,119
once but if you give them the recipe for

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,640
your cookies then they can enjoy them

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,079
anytime and they can make them their own

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,839
they can add some chocolate chips they

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,359
can make them sweeter they can do

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,839
uh their own thing to make their cookies

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,440
better so here is our open source cookie

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,400
recipe and all of you can go brown your

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,119

um is do not forget to continuously

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,640
improve

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,200
uh and it has to apply to everything

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,680
in your projects it has to apply to

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,079
everything

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,880
in your personal life work just don't

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,520
forget

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,119
that that's a that's a part of life that

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,680
feedback loop the uh

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,200
constant say the constantly saying hey

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,040
what can we do better together

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,079
as a community gosh the types of ideas

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,680
that come out of those types of

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,960
conversations have always been super

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
positive for me

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,640
so i just look i look forward to

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,880
communities participating those types of

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,000
activities more and more

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,319

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,480
so i want to thank everybody for coming

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,720
um and i think this actually wraps up

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,000
uh the official sessions for devconf but

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,280
there is a

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,800
final session that i believe there are

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,800
some fun things that are going to happen

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,599
i hear in the polls that there's comedy

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,760
involved there might be some comedy i

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,839
heard that i i tried to give

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,280
the organizers some pictures of me from

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,200
middle school but they they said no

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,839
thank you that's not comedy i think it's

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,839
funny

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,200
but they didn't so thank you all very

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,920
much that was a very interesting

00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,520
discussion

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,520
and it made it very easy as a moderator

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,880
just step back and listen

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:10,960
