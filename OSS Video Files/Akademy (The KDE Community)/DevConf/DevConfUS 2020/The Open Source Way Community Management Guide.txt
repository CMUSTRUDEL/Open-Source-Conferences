Title: The Open Source Way Community Management Guide
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Karsten Wade

Contributors to open source projects learn and create methods and practices for having a good community experience. Open source practitioners share these methods with each other all the time, and The Open Source Way brings those best practices together, written as a collaborative community effort. We are updating this guide; you are invited to learn about, participate in, and contribute to The Open Source Way and the community of practice around it.

In addition to bringing a slightly-opinionated view of how & what makes a successful project, this guide includes the often missing reasons -- why do certain practices work, and why have others been tried and abandoned.

This talk introduces the 2.0 version of the guide itself, what is covered within it, and highlight the narrative being told from/to community management practitioners. You'll learn how to consume and/or contribute to this guide and the body of community knowledge around it.

	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,640
so um as i tweeted out a few minutes ago

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,399
um or an hour ago or so

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,919
um after watching this conference for

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,120
the last couple of days and participate

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,400
in other things i really think the

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,799
conversation style

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,480
it just does make a huge difference um

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,240
and from what i'm hearing

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
uh it's somebody talks about five or ten

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,640
minutes that's enough to keep everyone

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,480
engaged and then

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
you know for people's engagement to stay

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
there and then you know

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
switching to some kind of conversation

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
or back and forth really helps so i

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,840
don't have another person to work with

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
today so i'm gonna find a way to work

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
with

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,039
we'll either add people in if you want

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
to come in or we'll do it from the chat

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
channel

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,920
um and if after we get there we'll see

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,280
i'm hoping that there's enough

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,559
engagement for that

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
so there is a youtube video um and i

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
think

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
uh we can i'll reach up there and see if

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
i can pin it like i can replace and pin

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,879
it so i'm going to do that

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,239
um and uh yeah so feel free to check

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,440
that out any time or share it with any

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,199
people it's literally the same stuff

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,000
i've given this talk a few times

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,280
in different forms i did this at fosdem

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
earlier this year

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
not not directly but just let a

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,320
a workshop and then a birds of a feather

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
session and a talk at scale earlier this

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,400
year so again this was all just

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
gathering not just gathering momentum

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
towards uh

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
working on something so let me let me go

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
forward and i'll spend a couple minutes

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,560
talking about what this thing is

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,200
and where we're at with it

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
so um in general we have this vision for

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
the guide

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,600
uh around and and there's a and there's

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,920
some history of how we got here

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
and then i'll also i won't take too long

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,880
than that i'll talk about where we are

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,840
here today and then what's coming next

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,600
and i will remember to slow down um so

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,880
the what here is what are we

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
really trying to do and and it started

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,159
out by wanting to create a

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
community management best practices

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
guide for open source practitioners

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,520
and practitioners is a nice broad term

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
it's not saying oh if you're not people

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,240
whose job it is to be a community

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
manager

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,719
air quote see but but anybody who cares

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
about how we practice open source

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,280
software and and the development of that

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
and and then also to make sure that it's

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
written by and from the experience of

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,680
the of those practitioners and this

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,799
could be practitioners of many levels

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,560
some of the

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
um i we have contributions into this

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,720
process so far from people who are new

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,800
to open source and their new questions

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
pointed out the holes in our outline for

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,440
example and created new content to be

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
made there so

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
just like anybody who comes along can

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
help fix the documentation and so forth

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,000
and then in this process we're actually

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,440
creating a community of practice to

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
maintain and grow the guide and

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
a community of practice might be a new

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,599
concept to some of you and

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,280
in general it's a it's a way that

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
academics and so forth have studied how

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,640
corporations and organizations

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
organizations broadly let's put it that

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,840
way um

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
whether a loose organization or a tight

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,040
organization have um have developed

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,640
communities of people meaning people who

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
get along in a friendly interpersonal

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,360
manner

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
uh who are focusing their community

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
energy towards getting better at the

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
practice of something

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
so yeah so this could be a loose

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
organization like skateboarders who get

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,640
together and practice skate tricks

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,080
but or a former organization like

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,159
lawyers who get together

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
to um to to take legal training and

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,040
better their practices

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,400
and things um and so that's a that's a

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
model of what we do in the open source

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
software community we're always trying

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,720
to improve what we're doing

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,319
and um and the practice of whatever

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,000
software we're trying to create and in

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,720
this this kind of meta community here

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
is to is to focus in on the best

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
practices for how to foster and maintain

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
those communities so

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
so these two things are happening at the

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
same time which is something that um

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,040
that i was always hoping was going to

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
happen so going back to a little over 10

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,120
years ago

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,159
um we set out to just to to

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,519
to deal with the fact that we were

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,640
always answering the same kinds of

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
questions

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,480
and the questions of and those questions

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,560
included not just what we should do for

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,640
an open source and how you do something

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
um in terms of you know how you make a

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,959
decision in open source or what's good

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,200
governance or

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,200
how do you deal with with uh difficult

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,360
situations with users and so forth

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
um but to include the why why do we

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,640
think this practice versus a different

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,840
practice is important

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,000
and then to write down those things that

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,879
we say all the time um but in the last

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
decade there's been

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,680
a more of an evolution in open source

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,720
development practices lots of things are

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
better understood

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,599
and there's always a chance to um you

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,200
know to improve what we're doing

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
um so in general we have this kind of

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,639
top-level guide just gives you the

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
viewpoint of the perspective or the

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,199
opinion of the people who are working on

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
this which is that you know

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,359
it's always good to start by

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,040
understanding what we mean when you say

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,680
community and open source community

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
and then then the belief is that uh the

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
way we grow an open source community is

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
by

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,680
taking care of users um that users are

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
the ones who are going to

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
you know take the software to a new

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,600
level help you find new things about it

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
just by the fact

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,759
just by their excitement and using it

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,639
and some of them will become

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,639
participants

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
and some of them become contributors if

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,840
you set out with this goal of

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,360
just going straight to the contributors

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,639
it's a lot more of a difficult process

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
it's sort of throw the code over the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,800
wall and hope the contributors come

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
along is

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
is a challenge so so the model that we

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,199
promote is this one of like you know

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
software wildly successful with users

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
and the participants and the

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
contributors will come along if you

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
lower the barriers appropriately for

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,199
them when they get there

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,520
and all of that talk about measuring

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
success and voting pitfalls from

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
mistakes and so this is the outline of

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
the guide that we are working on and

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
this guide has been informed by

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,520
these communications conversations that

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
we've been having over the last year

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,880
and as we began working on it so there's

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
been some evolution

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
in that um and here i'm not really going

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
to spend a lot of time

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,440
getting talking about the outline but we

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,280
have a number of chapters and we have a

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
github repository that we've been doing

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,320
all the work in um

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,520
in terms of um so in terms of where the

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
latest really is at

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
so i can i can spend a few minutes after

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,479
this presentation

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,919
and show that um uh

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
you know show where we are in the github

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
repo and explain why we're using all

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
this tooling and so forth

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
the um but the basic outline that we've

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,120
got you know just gets into a little bit

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,080
more deeply um but one thing i want to

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
highlight here is

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,840
is it's actually three different

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,479
pieces uh the new and to be done pieces

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
so

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,840
uh out of a conversation at scale

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,520
somebody suggested that we turn all of

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,960
these this big massive guide into a

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,080
quick start checklist for

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,199
communities that are that are smaller

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
you know two or three people may be

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,280
starting something i just want to make

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
sure they're heading in the right

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
direction

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
um so that's an example of just a good

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
you know good question from an audience

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,400
turning into something that's going to

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,400
become a nice work output to get picked

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
up right and um and this was a you know

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
this wasn't just a question from the

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
audience it was part of a communication

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
you know part of a discussion of

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
a source and you know while we were

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
doing this in a birds of a feather

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,360
workshop

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,319
and then um and along the way we

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,680
realized we had a

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
you know we're missing some content

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,919
around project communication and that

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
came up

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,039
with something that worked that was

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,639
happening downstream in red hat and

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
um that content got upstreamed into the

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
open source way to

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
help form the basis of that chapter um

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
and then the uh some new content has

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,599
come to us from

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,160
another uh publicat another book series

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
the

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
organization and they had a chapter that

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
didn't quite fit their outline on

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
inclusive communities and material fit a

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,759
whole that we had in terms of not

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,880
discussing and not having discussed um

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
you know not clearly discussing how

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
we're going to handle inclusive

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
communities um

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,479
and wanting to make sure that comes

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
right up front and attracting users at

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,360
the very beginning

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
you want to be you want to be inclusive

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
from that very beginning point so people

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
can come

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
in the project um and know that it's

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,120
software they can use and adopt

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
um and that's then that's uh that's one

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
of our preview chapters and we're going

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
to be doing a preview release within the

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
next month

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
of several chapters that are ready to go

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
and so you get a chance to actually see

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,520
what

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,199
um what the content looks like and and

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,759
and actually have some useful things

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,639
that that come from it and help maybe

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,720
possibly

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
see yourself or somebody you know uh

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
writing one of the other chapters that

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,759
we still have a writer for um

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
so it's an open source project we're

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,680
going to hit a milestone we're going to

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
lease what we got we're going to keep

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
moving forward

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
um so then section on a chapter on

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
guiding participants

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
um and talk about you know what

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
motivates people

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,879
that's a preview chapter ready to go um

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
and growing contributors uh talking

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
about what a contribution is

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,680
um making sure that people um really

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,360
understand how

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,599
we bring people in to be contributors

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,080
and and governance and so forth and

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,599
these are

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
which is another preview chapter so

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,720
people can understand you know when you

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
come into a project you can know how you

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
get successful how you

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,599
uh progress forward in the project and

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,639
so on

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,840
um and the measuring success

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
and um you know discussing metrics

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,199
what's the healthy community look like

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
and then um avoiding the pitfalls you

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,840
know and and in there we have

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
some new content around community

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,959
management self-care um and then a place

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
to talk about

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,360
all these various why stories that that

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,599
don't necessarily fit anywhere

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,039
they can that are modular they can fit

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
in various places they're a story that

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
that

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
illustrates several points and are

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,880
useful to refer to from

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
different parts of the book um so this

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
is just really the way that this

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,160
community

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
has decided how to organize this

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,360
information to to get it out

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,120
um into the world um and we're using uh

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,440
uh an ascii doc um workflow you use

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
ascii document github workflow and and

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
primarily we're starting here we

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
we went to github because it's a place

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
where a lot of potential contributors

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
are and it's a tool that can allow us to

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
have the

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
to do open source practice about having

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
the discussions about the content stay

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,680
with the content

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
so we're not having people hop all over

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
the place we can really

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
um have this kind of focused

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,880
conversations like the way a code and

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,000
patch management

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,560
process might work um and the

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
our best practices uh as a community or

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,680
what we recommend to people is

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
you know taking care of being locked

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,200
into platforms and

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,560
um and and so forth and so it's

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,959
something that we'll always keep in mind

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
is

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
you know it's it's not that we're tying

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,320
ourselves to github as the only

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,160
way to do things it's how we're getting

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,000
this this next version of the guide out

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
well as a community everyone will be

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,480
continue to review what tools we use and

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,200
where we host and so forth um so this is

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
just unique

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,320
being both pragmatic and following our

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,680
own advice which is

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,279
to be pragmatic and follow our own

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,800
advice it's a recursive thing you gotta

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,959
love it

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,240
um i'm gonna skip this we'll look at the

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,839
ghetto repo later

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
um and then in general aside from what's

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,560
happening in the get repo we have some

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,079
meta discussions on the

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
forum and mailing list uh it's pretty

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
light right now because we're really

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
focusing in on

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
on the book um and those things are

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,959
about that but it's become pretty

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
obvious that we're

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,760
you know that we became obvious in the

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,279
last number of months that we've really

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,640
got a community of practice here and we

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,200
do have content that's

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,959
come into the community that may not

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,160
directly fit into this guide and we're

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
we're looking at this

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,920
you know how we can be growing in

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,120
knowledge base of stories and

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,680
best practices that um you know that

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
right now for example were used where um

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
those of us in red hat's open source

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
program office

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
when we work on materials that we think

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
could fit into the upstream or fill a

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
hole here

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
we work on those materials in a way that

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,480
they can go get me directly upstream

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
so that they're that maybe there are a a

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,519
white paper

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,200
or um exactly what's the best term for

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,560
it now but just you know some two-pager

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
that explains like the basics of

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,079
open-source governance

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
uh may have would have its origins in a

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,360
much longer piece up in the open source

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,959
way about open source governance and

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,320
those things have got a direct

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,680
correlation um content upstream and

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,959
downstream is different than code

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,600
because of the way that

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,200
ideas get conveyed and and style and so

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
forth comes along so we're trying to

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
learn how to work with that

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,839
um in a sort of new way um this is a

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,200
screenshot of what the mailing list uh

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
is is like so we're at lists.the

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,680
opensourceway.org

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
i can type all this stuff in if it

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,560
really helps what we're using

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
we're using um so we're using mailman 3

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,720
which has a web interface so you can use

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,399
your email interface or the web form

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,839
interface it works really smooth i'm

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,160
super happy with it

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
um i go back and forth all the time

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,360
sometimes i'll type one you know

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
literally in the same discussion over a

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
ten minute period

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,920
uh right so right now what we've got is

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,320
a project uh project dynamic of us

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,360
focusing on getting the the book content

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,480
done

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,120
and um and then and i'll touch upon this

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
a little bit

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,079
but the goal is to to mix up and shake

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,079
up you know kind of blow up the

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,440
governance uh do something different do

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,680
the people who come along and create the

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,399
book will decide what the governance is

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,600
uh but for now i'm the project lead and

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,120
it's just you know i'm just keeping this

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
thing moving that's the main thing i do

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
and i'm writing some stuff and i'm

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
editing and so forth

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440
uh brian profit is our lead editor and

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
really rely upon his expertise and focus

and uh definitely helps keep me and

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,040

his and he gets to work with

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,959
writers especially uh in the development

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,360
phase if they need somebody to work with

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,000
and help think through the content and

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,079
then also

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,519

and then we've got a growing writing

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
team um some of the chapters i mentioned

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,160
earlier

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,079
um gordon half was the author on the um

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
intrinsic value and contributions

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,800
chapter um

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,839
and uh ashley nicholson ray pike working

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
on content

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
around uh community management self-care

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,800
and metrics and so forth so we're

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,800
getting

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,079
um so we do work you know what it's nice

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
it's a great way to track some of these

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,959
here work on this chunk of something

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
that you have some interest around and

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
then helps um

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
you know it's a great way of pulling

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,519
people into the community so we're

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,720
having really good medic conversations

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,240
and uh just really quickly so you can

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
have an idea of what it's like to you

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
know what it takes to

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
if you've got interest in working on

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,040
this content um you go into github

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,480
and you there there's an issue related

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
to each chapter and like

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
i said we can look at this in a few

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
minutes um

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,760
[Music]

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
so each chapter has an issue assigned to

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,480
it so all the content and works happens

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,880
in that issue

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
and um you can just you go into that

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,440
issue and you put in your suggestion for

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
an outline

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
if you need to discuss bigger ideas and

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
stuff with the mailing list is there for

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,240
you as well

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
um once your the winter outline is is

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
approved uh one of the editors this

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,199
looks great let's go forth

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,880
then you work on the content um via the

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,120
the git repo you know you use your own

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,760
editor and so forth working husky dot

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
and then it moves through um it moves

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
through the uh

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,000
the process and there's a there's

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
basically a pull request that happens at

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
each

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,920
um at each step so first you're

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
you get your initial outline or your

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,000
initial draft just is pulled into the

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
main

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,320
uh branch and then as each editors

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
move things along uh choosing who has

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,839
the pen

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,440
from draft review to a development

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,160
review and subject matter expert review

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
and so forth

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
we do a pull request process so we've

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
got a chance to um to track the

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,760
discussion around that

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,079
that each step and so forth so there's a

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,360
to um i was going to say to a large

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
degree

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,880
to a very large degree we are making up

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,680
the process of how we

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,639
are writing content and workflowing it

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,639
by mapping

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,000
an editorial work publishing process on

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,320
top of github

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,519
and it so happens that the open

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
organization

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,000
uh is working on a book at the same time

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
using the same process we've got

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
several people in common across those

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,600
two groups so we're sharing doing

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,959
tight knowledge sharing uh as a group

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
they're farther along in terms of their

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,519
experience of creating books

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
they've worked as a group and they're on

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,639
their sixth or so i think they're on the

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
eighth book by now or something like

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,560
that

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
um but we're all brand new work on the

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,959
stuff in github so um once we're done

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,120
here

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,279
there will be something to do to help

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,639
teach people about how you can

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,160
use you know github to do this um

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,600
and i've got to finish up because i

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,199
promised myself i was going to talk for

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
more than 10 minutes and it looks like i

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,639
might be already getting it to 15.

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,079
um so we're you know we're working in

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
the editing workflow is we're basically

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,120
creating things a little bit as we go um

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
september uh previously released coming

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
2.0 released in december

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,720
um i mentioned that the governance we're

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
going to be blowing that up so as soon

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,600
as we're done with the book roll

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,320
the community will decide for itself um

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
what it uh what it thinks and right

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,600
there i'm going to leave this slide up

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,120
for right now and i'm going to stop

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,320
attacking and i'm looking looking if

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,279
there's any questions they'll come up in

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,120
chat and just open up

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,120
oh um

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,880
and just open up for for for some

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
conversation and i'm also gonna pull up

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
the github repo so i can show you

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,639
um actually i'm gonna switch over to

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,680
that

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,680
uh what the workflow looks like

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,959
so i have never really tried to compress

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,079
all of that that's that

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,320
that quickly in there i might have

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,759
skipped some bits did uh so let me know

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,800
do that make sense what questions do

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,720
folks have what's

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
um do you have interest in using content

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,959
like this um just as is like hey i can

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,880
just point it to people and say

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,399
great here's the here's how you do it

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,519
and why you do it

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,120
um you know and uh is this is there any

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,160
value in this content being something

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
that you might pull into your

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,519
organization and

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,199
you might start like a quick primer from

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,319
this content be able to go and grab it

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,000
you know because we're trying to write

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,480
it with a certain sense of modularity in

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,959
mind

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,799
but we know we're definitely not there

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,319
all the way

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,400
okay so let's see if i can stop this

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,039
screen share and switch my screenshot to

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
something else

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,839
okay great

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,120
okay

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
oh very have a slightly difficult time

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,039
figuring out

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,440
the selecting my window and hop into

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,440
share

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
which one of these is actually the

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,400
i think i think it's the one just i had

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,640
no title

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
okay

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,080
yeah okay great i'm going

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,240
to a little bit i'm going to make it

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:39,520
wide and then increase the

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:43,600
fontanese a little bit um

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,080
yeah okay so um what i wanted to show

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,360
which is for for uh which is you know

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,799
another kind of interesting

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,600
aspect of this i think which is really

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,600
the the workflow that we're doing so

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,720
we've

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,960
um we've set up a number of columns um

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,840
that are either that that define the the

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,600
stages of the work

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,679
of of the workflow so we we have an

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:11,840
outline that are that has a number

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,840
of chapters right and and each um

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
um yeah i'm getting i always get i get

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,559
i'm so i get confused with the

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,600
terminology around section and chapter

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,640
all the time so i'm probably going to

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,280
confuse that

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
but if um if we look at the outline

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,559
which i can do up here

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
in

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,080
um if i can do it by pointing up the

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,840
outline itself let's

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,840
do that

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,520
um so each one of these areas so at

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
introductions and attracting users um

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,039
this is a

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,240
chapter i think in our parlance i keep

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
calling that a section these are some

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
things a chapter and

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,440
or maybe they are chapters i forget but

00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,559
each one of these sub points is an inte

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,080
as a unique item um like why do people

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,919
participate in open source you know

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,559
that's a chapter basically

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,080
and when we come back over here um an

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,880
editorial and this is i'm going to go

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
all the way to the right because that's

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
when a chapter that

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,480
has been always the other process and

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,480
it's 100 complete

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,280
that's so good let's go on today okay

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
there we go

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,159
and um

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,480
yeah oh it looks like the issue needs to

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,520
be open so

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,520
maybe it's not if the issue's closed um

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,159
so there's a um

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,440
what was my point with this um yeah so

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
there's so there's a direct correlation

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
each one there's an issue that's created

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,120
for each of the items that's in the

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
outline

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,320
and then that way um so the issue stays

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320
open until

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,080
that and that's why that issue is open

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,080
or closed excuse me because the issue

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,200
stays open until something is in

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,400
um you know it's it is completed um

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
although it will close i mean if it

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
closes

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,200
if the issue gets closed for any reason

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,559
we just reopen it um

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
and i know i'm kind of using a mix of

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,360
github and publishing content here so

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,880
this is i don't know

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
how useful this is in terms of people's

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,159
understanding what we're doing but

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,440
um there's a there's a piece of

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
content that needs to be written it's an

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
introduction for

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,440
a chapter on community fundamentals you

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,840
know kind of the 101 of what a community

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,840
is right

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:30,400
and if i open up the full issue

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,400
pop over to it

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,840
uh it's a place that it at home you know

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,799
it holds all the conversations in the

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
comments

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,919
uh and all the details about it and so

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,480
forth just like any other issue would

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,760
have

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
uh we've got it marked against a

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,360
milestone of 2.0

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,360
um and it's got some uh some labels

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,039
you know it's saying that it's a chapter

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,880
saying that it's uh

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,159
it's part of the editorial board and

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,600
that it's introductory material as

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,240
opposed to contributor oriented material

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,840
um so for if we're so this is a piece of

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,200
material that's also to be assigned so

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,799
if you come in here somebody comes in

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
it's just it's fairly straightforward

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,799
or clear once you you know decipher

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,880
what's going on that this column on

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,320
this column on the left is the material

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,720
that's to be assigned

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,919
and um and you can look through and say

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,000
oh here's something interesting i'd like

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,559
to write a section on uh guiding or a

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
chapter on

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,840
uh on the types of participant

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
contributions you know i know it's more

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,799
than just code

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,039
right so what is all of that and so

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,799
forth um and it may be um

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,400
and it may be that this is something

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,960
that is that is written with several

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,480
people who

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,080
break it up into different parts and

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,760
simple excuse me so there's a lot of

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,760
opportunities

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,280
um to collaborate for with people who

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
are at different levels as well some

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,520
people may

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,520
um we were talking with somebody

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,840
yesterday who's who who

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,280
might have some some of their people who

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,000
are new to open source

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,679
go through and help uh create the

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,880
content about new to open source so that

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,720
they're helping write something

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
and contributed into here that is from

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,440
their direct experience

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,640
right now with those of us who have a

00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
little more experience coming in and

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,799
editing and

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,320
helping throwing the blanks on it um

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,320
so then once something has been assigned

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
where there's we we have criteria for

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,640
moving between each of these uh

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,679
um columns uh in order for a chapter

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,039
uh well from to move between the columns

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,679
going from assigned to drafting and so

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
forth

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,960
along the way in here there's going to

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,240
be an actual

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,559
file that's going to be um brought in as

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,120
a

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,080
as a merge request as a poll request by

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
the author

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
and this is going to be an ascii doc

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,159
file that's going to be the content of

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
their you know their first draft of

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,559
their chapter so they're so they're

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,480
in their drafting moment here um

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,840
and when um so ray for example is

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,120
working on community metrics that

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,600
chapter is

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
oh it is like i think by monday is my

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,640
it's probably going to be

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,320
ready to shift in if not by the end of

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,679
today um there was a little bit more

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,039
stuff that was going to happen for it i

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,640
think and then it'll be shifted over and

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,919
that's going to be done by pull request

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,240
and when the pull request happens you

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,559
can see it's a linked pull request

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,520
um which is the update for it once

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,440
that's all done

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,720
uh the um it will close the issue which

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,159
will then reopen that's just one of the

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,159
side effects of this

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
and it'll move over to the draft review

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,159
column which means that it's ready for

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,840
an editor to go in and and kind of take

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
the pen and make a draft review

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,279
here's what you know here's what here

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,159
does this draft got all of the basics to

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,840
be a chapter

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,440
or there are big sections that say to be

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,919
written in which case we say you know

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,320
what

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
this isn't really a draft it's it's pre

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,960
it's drafting why don't you take it back

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,720
and finish this first

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,640
uh once we've confirmed that it's got

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,919
the same the same stuff the editor makes

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
a pull request and it gets moved to the

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,279
development edit

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,480
um and so forth development edit is

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
really going through and saying should

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,200
this section be here is our section

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,279
missing

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
can you do some figures to describe this

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,919
you know it's really thinking

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,320
help develop the chapter to be at

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,080
another level um we have subject matter

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,440
expert reviews which you would do and

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,480
anytime you have something

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,600
significant in this case um

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
we have two or three chapters that i

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
think are um can really do with reviews

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
from outside of the subject matter

00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
experts that are part of this community

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
already

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,799
much of this content we are the subject

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,240
matter experts kind of so we might as

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,960
well just you know we don't have to go

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
too far

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,720
but everything's read by a couple of

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,960
editors to make sure that it all gets um

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,840
you know it all gets to that new level

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,400
and in this whole process we really are

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,000
learning

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,279
about how we want to manage content and

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
think about things as a community of

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,960
practice

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,559
um so just for example yesterday we had

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
a discussion about the um

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,159
metrics chapter and real and and the

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,799
chaos

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,200
foundation i believe is the right

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,120
c-h-a-o-s-s

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,360
is a um you know there's a group that's

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
working on real details around community

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
metrics and we share some

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,159
some people who work on this project

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,760
also work in that uh but there seems to

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,840
be like there must be some delineations

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,880
between

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,240
um obviously we have some things to say

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,360
about metrics and so

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
our chapter here is focused on things

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
like

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,480
the kinds of things you would do if

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
you're going to evaluate a project and

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,279
find out

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,799
how you would decide what metrics to

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
track for that project right

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,600
and that seems to me like it might be a

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
reasonable thing for this community as a

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,159
community practice to say we're going to

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,840
help you with the practice of

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,360
figuring out what you want to track for

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,520
your community and once you get an idea

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,080
what the five or ten or dozen things are

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,240
this community over here really has got

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,159
all the stuff to get deeper into that

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,559
um thank you and so the

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,919
um you know these these are these are

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,440
amorphous things that are really only

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,440
when i referred earlier about the

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,240
evolution and in the last 10 years these

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,039
are the kinds of things that have

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,480
evolved and

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,000
10 years ago there wasn't even a single

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,880
place to have all of these discussions

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,799
really

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,400
and we tried to do that and it really

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,720
wasn't kind of right for that we had

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
some

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,240
material there it was good but this is

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
um you know this clearly

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,279
takes things to a different a different

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,880
level so um so these are things that

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,600
we're sort of discovering as we're

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,520
creating this

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,440
this stuff and and we can have that okay

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,400
great well next year we'll think about

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,760
that right now

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
we know we're doing the right thing by

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,320
writing this content it seems to fit

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,279
into our

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,799
into our process really nicely and um

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
and another you know the standard copy

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,279
edit make sure everything's really clean

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,720
um and and to bring it out so there are

00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
there are several chapters in here i'm

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,000
going to click

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,799
on the preview chapter tag and so you

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
can see that

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,760
um we have um uh we have several

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,279
chapters in here that we're planning to

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,880
bring out in the previous release

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,919
and as long as everything um

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
yeah so it's just bringing those things

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,880
over over the just like within any

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,919
community you know getting yourselves to

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,679
the next point

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,480
making that decision and saying okay

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,000
we're going to do this and we're going

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
to push forward and make that particular

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
thing happen get it over the finish line

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,039
i would like a better metaphor than that

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,039
but that's what occurs to me

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,600
um so in all of this and i and and i

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,559
just want to refer back around to

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,200
something that i think is

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,960
is that has come up a lot that is a real

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
really strong interest to me personally

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,159
and

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,640
and to those of us working on the

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,480
project i think as well is that

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,720
is that we've we sort of designed for

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,200
ourselves um to a degree what we think

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
it was like

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,039
we could think of as like the perfect

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,120
upstream community for us to place

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,399
all of this how you do open source stuff

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,799
knowledge and by

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,919
perfect it doesn't just mean perfect for

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,720
everyone at red hat

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
because what we know from our you know

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,240
experience

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,679
is that working with uh people within

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,760
with a community that is

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,720
that is diverse from many perspectives

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
the people in it

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,520
are the people in it uh come from many

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,360
different backgrounds have many

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,799
different life experiences

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
don't look like each other don't act

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,600
like each other and they're

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
organizationally diverse

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,520
so um group organizations of different

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,399
types and size coming in and bringing

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,799
their perspective

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,679
on and how we do things really important

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,799
way to to

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,480
um to to actually you know have these

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
ideas that that

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,120
that do the best in circumstances lift

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,640
to the top you know the best ideas thing

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,080
and um and so for us we

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,200
we would know that if we just created

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,480
something that was really red hat

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,559
centric we would be

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,159
you know cutting off the blood supply

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,559
the the oxygen

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
for um for that to be able to grow to be

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,120
something even bigger

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,559
and and and which would then benefit us

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,120
even more right i mean it's this

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,240
perfectly selfish thing um again that

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,200
perfect word right

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,320
so um uh but but and then and part of

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,240
this is is because it's

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,039
it's you know it's it's gonna be modular

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,880
it's gonna be it's it has to be to fit

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,399
the needs of the community of folks who

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,760
come along for this

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,120
um and and by modular what i mean is

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,440
again referring back to what our open

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,279
source program office does um

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,960
we we've got some materials and i can

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,120
you know that we can point to that are

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,000
out on redhat.com that are that talk

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,919
about

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,520
um like for the governance is a good

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,120
example that comes to mind right away

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,840
where the source material is here in the

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,520
open source way that caught the chapter

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
um written by several of our community

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,919
architects um

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,399
long-standing experienced people um that

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
same

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,919
content you know is that that's the

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
upstream for this for this

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
content that is put out under the red

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,840
hat brand and spoken that way

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,039
and there's a direct um i don't know

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
exactly what's the right word here but

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,360
there's a direct

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,960
relationship between those particular

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,360
pieces and it may not even be that when

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,200
you look at one in the other you say oh

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,559
you know um because it's we don't want

00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,679
to set up any plagiarism alarms or

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
anything too i guess right i know this

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,559
is we're exploring this this is a whole

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,240
new experience of how do you

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
like how do you uh how do you do things

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,159
right and not not ruin your search

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,360
engine optimization i guess

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,440
um so uh and

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,039
and and the expectation is that that if

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,960
we find this to be useful

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,360
you might find it to be useful it may be

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,880
that for your organization you've got

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,559
you know you bring in 100 new developers

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,159
every year who are brand new to open

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,960
source and if you could have

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,360
if you could create your own comic book

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,240
or

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,440
super type book that just so showed the

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,799
10 things you need to know to get

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
started you give that to everybody new

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,200
higher orientation

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
and the two months later you came along

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,640
with the 25 more things you need to know

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,320
or whatever

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,760
and the source for all of that comes

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,960
from the open source way so you're not

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,159
having to go and create the material

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,919
manually yourself

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,360
you're not having to like to double

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,559
check is this really the right way to do

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
it should we be doing that

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,880
and then really importantly you've got

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,640
that source of the reasons why

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,399
because what resonates with other people

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,440
like i think

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,120
i think it bears out is um is is having

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
hands-on experience with something or

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,399
that vicariousness like oh why did you

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,640
how did that happen like oh

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,519
that was terrible oh no wonder you do it

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
that way

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,200
yeah let's make sure that doesn't happen

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,480
again um oh what a wonderful outcome

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,720
because you did it that way we'll make

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,279
sure

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
you do that and learn from that and then

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,519
come back and tell you how it was and

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,200
see if there's

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,960
something better that comes in here so

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,720
so so that's the best thing to me about

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,440
a community practice is that it's a

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,519
it's a conversation that's ongoing and

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,120
it's a way of capturing the conversation

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,480
uh that's meaningful to the people

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,919
involved in it and meaningful

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,159
potentially the people who are outside

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,159
of it

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
um i think that was all the stuff that i

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,880
had in my mind that i wanted to really

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
get out there

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,559
one way or the other whether it comes up

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,000
or not um what are questions and stuff

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,159
do people have or what

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
does anybody want to come in on coming

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,559
on mic and ask questions or store

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,600
anything in chat

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,600
if i'm not missing anything

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,440
i think there's anything else

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,440
interesting to show here

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,880
all the issues i'm gonna stop sharing

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,720
cool cool okay well then that says to me

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
that that that we have

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,840
we are done with our engagement and it

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,799
is time for us to move on to the next

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,840
cool thing

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,559
um so how about that um

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,120
i will get done now and um i'll hang out

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,080
somewhere

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,679
i think there's somewhere i can go and

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,960
hang out for a breakout session for a

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,120
little bit and um

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,240
i'm also in the newcomer booth or should

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,919
be i'll make sure i'm back and then you

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,200
come up with in the expo hall

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:43,200
um and um we can

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,440
i on my way out here i will throw up my

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,039
i'll still get slides it should be the

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,480
right one right

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,840
