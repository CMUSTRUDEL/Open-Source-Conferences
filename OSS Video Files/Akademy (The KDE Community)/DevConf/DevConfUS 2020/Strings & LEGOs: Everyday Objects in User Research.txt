Publication date: 2020-10-06

	Speaker: Sara Chizari & Sarahjane Clark

User research isn't all clipboards and watching users behind one-way mirrors. Hands-on activities are an effective and valuable method to engage participants, gather data, and recruit for future studies. We will show you how to use everyday objects in your next group meeting or hackathon to collect high-quality, valuable data and spark in-depth conversations. We'll discuss two case studies where we used these techniques: a string board for building personas and a LEGO board for a visual style reaction study.
