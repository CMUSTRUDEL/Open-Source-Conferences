Title: Strings & LEGOs: Everyday Objects in User Research
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Sara Chizari & Sarahjane Clark

User research isn't all clipboards and watching users behind one-way mirrors. Hands-on activities are an effective and valuable method to engage participants, gather data, and recruit for future studies. We will show you how to use everyday objects in your next group meeting or hackathon to collect high-quality, valuable data and spark in-depth conversations. We'll discuss two case studies where we used these techniques: a string board for building personas and a LEGO board for a visual style reaction study.

all right so for the next session we're

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,759
gonna have a talk by sarah jane

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,800
and sarah they'll be speaking about

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
everyday objects

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,559
in user research and i'll just share

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
that

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,920
in a minute

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,880
if you all can see this screen

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,480
please let me know in chat hi everyone

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,840
thanks for joining our talk we're going

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,079
to talk about listening to

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,079
lego today using everyday items

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
my name is sarah jane clark i go by sj

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,399
and i'm a senior user experience

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,399
researcher at red hat and i focus on

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
developer products

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
and i'm sarah i'm also a senior uw

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
tutorial red hat

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,239
my focus is basically on rail and

00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:01,199
anything that's related to well

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,960
all right so you have gotten somehow

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,680
access to a whole bunch of users

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
which is amazing now you've got some

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
questions for them you want to ask them

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,119
about

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
their motivations their how they use

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,720
product what they

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
are doing with your particular project

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,200
but now what do you do with them

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,320
so you could try some of the old

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,000
standard type

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,479
things that you would do for research

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,880
you could do a usability test

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,720
you could try a survey um even a card

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,920
sort if you're looking at navigation or

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
that sort of thing

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
maybe you have some sketches or a

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
prototype you kind of want to walk them

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,119
through that stuff

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,200
to get their ideas and these are all

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
great options they're still

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,479
you know the foundation of our toolbox

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
but

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
those are all screen based options what

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,560
if you actually got them

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
up and away from the screen

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
so the question really is how can we get

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,880
the same quality of data that you would

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,079
get from those kind of old standard

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,200
type research methods but do it in kind

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,360
of a more visual

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,200
and interactive and engaging way

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,400
all right so let's take a look at the

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
string board

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,760
this was a project that i put together

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,720
for our company's annual conference

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,440
and what i had set out to do originally

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,599
was to

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
help us update our knowledge about our

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,800
developer audience

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,480
so we wanted to update our persona set

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,480
we wanted to understand more about their

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,959
motivations and their workflow just kind

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,879
of some foundational information

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
so to that end i put together this

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
survey

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
and we were going to have our attendees

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,760
our participants in this case

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
uh do this study on this tablet an

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,640
eight-inch tablet

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
they would hold the tablet while in our

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,680
booth and answer the questions

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,400
on the form and that's a perfectly good

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
survey it's

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,519
it's still serviceable and it still

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
accomplishes

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,000
what i set out to do but i thought what

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
if we could make this more engaging and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
more visual

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,200
what if i made it so that i could still

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,760
engage with them and talk with them

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
while they're answering these questions

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
so i thought well what if i brought this

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
to life kind of in a 3d way

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
what if i could put this on a board that

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,920
they would interact with

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
physically

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,400
so this actually would help me address a

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,560
couple of concerns i had so first

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,920
it's difficult to interact with somebody

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,959
while they're focusing on

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,640
a screen or you know using a tablet it's

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
a little creepy to kind of be hovering

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
over them and

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
you know hoping that you'll catch a

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
glimpse of what their answer is so that

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
you can

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,159
engage them in deeper conversation

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
when i put this board together as you

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,920
can see in this picture here it was so

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,840
much easier to kind of step back

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,599
you know not really be in the person's

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
uh personal space

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
but still be able to strike up a

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,720
conversation with them or

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,159
as you see um with the person there on

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
the right he was able to listen

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,000
in and still get some information from

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
this conversation so it was so much

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,360
easier to kind of spark that up

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,360
uh in the moment

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,360
so here's the board what we did was

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,880
uh we took all of those same survey

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,239
questions and those are each of the

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,440
columns

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,000
and each uh role had their own color of

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,759
string

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
so that what they would do is come along

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
and choose their string that

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,639
matched what their role is and they

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,680
would wrap it around

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,280
each peg in each column that would

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
correspond to the answers that they

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
would provide in the survey

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
so we're getting the same information

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,919
that we got from the survey but it's

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
much more visual

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,840
and it builds up over time so we would

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
have folks that would come back to our

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
booth

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,600
you know two or three times in the day

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,560
and see how

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,320
this data had changed and uh amassed

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,080
over the day they were interested

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,840
in the story it was telling so we were

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
able to have conversations

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,400
not only with the folks who responded

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,639
but with casual observers

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,800
so through this board this photo was

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
taken it was about two and a half hours

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,560
of

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,400
um users passing by here in total

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,199
the three times that we used this board

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,440
we got over 250 data points

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
now similar surveys that we did that we

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,400
actually did

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
on the tablets got fewer than five

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,199
responses

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,759
so this was definitely much more

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,840
engaging for our target audience but

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,840
also for folks who were

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,320
kind of passing by and providing

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
comments

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
so every night after we used this board

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
we would

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
uh unravel the strings and enter that

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
data right into this

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
spreadsheet so it made it really easy to

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,240
after we wrap up

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
keep track of the data that we had so

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
when we got back to the office on monday

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
morning

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,080
it was all there and ready to go and

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,000
ready to be analyzed

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
let's have a look at another example

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,039
similar to stringboard

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,039
we call this activity the lego word

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,039
similar to this string board lego word

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,600
is like multiple choice question but

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,520
fun and colorful in this example we

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,440
wanted to understand customers first

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,960
impression and reaction to a visual

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,960
design example

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
so we provided a list of positive and

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,960
negative words and

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
and to choose the ones that best

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,160
describe the design

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
however the one thing that we changed

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
here was that instead of having them to

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
select from a list of words in a certain

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
way

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,440
we had them to select from lego bricks

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,440
we used a different lego color for each

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,120
word and had a participant to choose

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,520
from the lego bricks

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,479
after the after selecting the colors we

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,120
asked our participants to put together

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
something with the legos they chose and

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
make something fun

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
this was a great opportunity for us to

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,319
engage with them while they are

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
playing with the lego to better

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,120
understand the why behind their

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,599
selection

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
so for example if they selected to

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,880
choose

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,479
flexible from the list we had the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
opportunity to ask them

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,960
why they thought the design is flexible

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
and what makes it flexible to them

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,440
every time we did this activity we were

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
able to collect more than 100 responses

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,160
which is

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,039
a pretty high number for a survey

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
question like this

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,120
since we didn't have enough lego bricks

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,560
for all hundred something participants

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
we had every day

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
we had at the end of every day we had to

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,400
take apart

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,840
our pieces from the board to be ready

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
for the next day

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
we took them apart and counted the

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,520
number and

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,440
honestly what's more fun than playing

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,800
with legos with your colleagues after

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,319
a long conference day so on the last day

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
of the conference we got together

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
and built the city and called the

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,680
patreon fly city because it was a

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,879
pattern fly project

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,639
so this is the end outcome of our

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,479
project we wanted to understand what

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,840
words come to people's mind when they

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,960
look at their design

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,479
so we use those words as as bricks and

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,240
put them together and we

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,400
created something called pattern fly

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,919
city

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,120
here is another example of the same

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,879
activity at def conference last year

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
we were interested to learn which

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,800
libraries and frameworks our front-end

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
developers use the most

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,319
so we use the same method to gather the

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,800
data we've been looking for

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
but in very engaging and fun way if you

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
have attended

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,400
devconferno last year you most probably

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,879
have seen this activity

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,160
so is the data as good as regular

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,360
methods

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,959
well to be honest with you yes so this

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,279
data that we are gathering we are

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,240
collecting very high quality data

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
because

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,719
first of all we are not just gathering

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,959
some hard data but at the same time we

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,720
are gathering qualitative data

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,720
because we are having the opportunity to

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
engage with our customers and users to

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
understand the why behind their

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
selection

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
and just better understand what they're

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
doing and

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,200
just learn more about them but at the

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
same time these activities are simple to

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,120
put together

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
as sj showed you we use everyday

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,399
material to put

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
these activities together they're

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
engaging they're enjoyable

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
and they're great for building

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,240
relationship with your users

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
as user researchers not only we are

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
responsible for creating and delivering

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
sound and robust research insight to

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
improve our product experiences for

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
users

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
but also we have the responsibility to

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
make the research participation

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,600
experience enjoyable and pleasing for

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
our users and the participants

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
so this is what makes user researchers

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,040
different than data scientists our

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,720
source of data

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,560
is humans so we need to be humanly

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,800
with our data collection approaches

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,080
whenever we have the opportunity

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,880
so to humanify research approaches we

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,560
would need to bring art crafts colors

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,640
and games into the play

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,640
similar to the ones we just discussed

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,760
okay so i bet now you are excited to try

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,040
your own activity

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,079
and we've got some helpful tips for you

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,200
to get started with your own exercise

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,320
so first like you would do with any good

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,720
research study

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
you want to start with the question that

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
question is going to drive

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
everything else that you do with this

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
exercise so you want to be pretty clear

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,959
up front what it is you want to learn

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,760
secondly simple but not necessarily easy

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,680
is best for activities like this so as

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,959
you saw with the examples we gave the

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
answers were brief

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,800
one or two words and that makes it a lot

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
easier to pair up

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,959
uh the answers with the items that the

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,240
users will be

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,480
working with third you want to look

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
around you for inspiration

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
like sarah said are you into games are

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,240
you into movies

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,279
do you do arts and crafts do you crochet

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,959
do you knit

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
i bet you've got some interesting things

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,800
laying around that would help you

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,600
uh put together a really cool exercise

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,640
like this be creative

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,880
fourth consider your audience

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,480
so when we do these activities they tend

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,680
to be in kind of loud

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,920
uh you know brightly lit spaces where

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,600
there's a lot of people milling around

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,760
when you're putting together your

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
exercise think these things through

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,120
think it through like what the sound is

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,120
going to be like is there going to be

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,160
table space you want to figure out these

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,839
logistics

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,440
ahead of time and that's going to help

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
you make decisions about how you put

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,440
your exercise together

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,800
fifth build a prototype and test it

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
when you've got somebody standing there

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
with you that is not when you want to be

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
working out those issues that you have

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,839
with your board

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,720
so you know take the time to put

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
together

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,279
a sample it doesn't have to be your

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,200
final item if it is that's great

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,480
but test out these things get your

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
friends to participate

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
and work out those issues

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,000
six iterate it's rare that you're gonna

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
gonna get it right on the first attempt

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,760
uh we certainly didn't in both of our

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,519
activities this is your chance to refine

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
and improve on what you discovered while

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
you were testing out your prototype

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
you want to keep refining it until it's

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
just right a good example is with my

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
string board

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,200
after a participant would answer all of

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,360
the questions sometimes there'd be these

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,680
really long lengths of string

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
left behind and they'd be laying on the

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,079
ground and that's kind of a tripping

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,480
hazard in a busy

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,519
area so we went back to the drawing

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
board literally

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
and we created a way for them to tie off

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,920
the remainder of the string so it wasn't

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
draping on the floor

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,279
that's the kind of iteration that you

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,200
need for your projects

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,800
i hope these tips get you excited to try

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
your own exercise

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,480
we look forward to seeing what you come

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,639
up with please get in contact with us at

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,639
the information we've listed here

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,639
thanks for your time thank you

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,680
thank you sorry and sarah that was a

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,200
really nice talk

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:03,120
and um i hope we all get to you know try

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,720
try some of the um tips that you gave us

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,519
sorry you had an interesting question

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,079
and i don't know if anyone has

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,320
um a response to that on thoughts of how

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,839
to adapt these activities

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,959
for virtual groups um folks if you have

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,160
um if you have ideas

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,639
feel free to drop them in chat but for

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,720
now

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,760
i guess we'll head over to the breakup

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,639
room

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,639
