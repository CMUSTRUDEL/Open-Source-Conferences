	00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,560
hi everybody

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
thanks so much for coming

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,920
as you may know this is

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,960
devconf.us and we're really excited to

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,680
have you

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,120
and uh i wanted to tell you a little bit

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
about the conference and a little bit

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,360
about me

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,559
uh so i'm langdon white and uh i

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,719
am in uh i have a weird job now but

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,960
uh basically i try to do some advocacy

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,559
for red hat around some of our products

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,239
uh you've probably seen me before

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
because this is my third time running

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,359
the show

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,079
and uh so again kind of thanks all for

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,280
coming uh

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,240
it's uh it's really tough to give a talk

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
like this because

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,439
you get very little feedback so you know

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,640
kind of fair warning

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,320
um but uh let me see if i can find my

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,439
notes because that would be uh make this

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,439
a little bit easier

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,280
so devconf us uh devconfus is based on

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,000
devconf cz which i think will be in its

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
12th year

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
in january uh this is our third year

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
running but our first time doing a

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
virtual

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,920
conference so hopefully we'll be able to

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
pull it off

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,280
and it will be uh super cool

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,320
so what i want to start with

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,520
is basically some people who i've been

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
able to

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,200
pull in um and uh sally o'malley and

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
urvashi and mahan i could never say your

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
last name um

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,360
and uh each peop each person's gonna

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,159
introduce themselves in a minute but i

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
wanted to give a little bit of

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
background

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
about devconf in case uh you are

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
unfamiliar with it

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,240
so uh we celebrate open source

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
at this conference and what that means

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
is

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,399
not just open source software not just

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
frias and beer but also the communities

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,920
around it

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,120
and how we want to grow those

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,599
communities

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
and by providing opportunities to speak

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,160
and providing opportunities to go to a

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,160
conference

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,440
and you know kind of all those various

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
things

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
and so this conference is very focused

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
on

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,560
you know basically on new people so this

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
is an opportunity for

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
people who have never given a talk

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,560
before to come and give a talk this is

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
an opportunity for someone who's never

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
been to a conference to come

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
and finally understand what the hallway

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
track is

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,400
we are very focused on developers um but

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,400
uh we also have a bunch of tracks that

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
are around kind of the other aspects of

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,160
open source

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,480
software like uh the process of creating

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
it right or the user experience

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,599
differences when you're working in open

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,360
source versus when you're

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
uh working in a proprietary software

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
company uh so

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,440
uh that's kind of a little bit of an

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,680
introduction to devconf um

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
and uh hopefully some of you are new and

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
some of you have been here before

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,239
and uh without further ado i'm going to

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,000
hand it off to one of my first co-chairs

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,280
sally o'malley hello

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,400
good morning um yep i

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,680
event by night

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,360
sometimes those lines get blurry

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,040
i've been to many tech conferences but

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,239
it's special it's about the speakers

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,440
it's about developers it's about people

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
not products it's about open source and

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,519
our community

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,599

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000
technical conference that i

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,080
attended and also the first one yet at

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,280
which i gave a talk

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,040
um it it gave me a platform to talk

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
about and share all the cool stuff that

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
i get to work on

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,280
and it set me up with some critical

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,720
experience for continuing to present in

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
the future

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
as i entered the room two years ago i

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
most definitely did not see myself

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,360
being one of the coaches for deaf month

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,759
us but accidents can happen

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,440
the journey so far has been amazing and

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,680
i know devmount will continue to have

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,360
this impact on many others such as my

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,360
conference buddy here mr eor

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
so first of all i would like to thank

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,720
our track captains for volunteering

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,080
their time to create

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
all the content you will be seeing

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
throughout the conference

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
i would also like to thank the entire

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
deafbond crew

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
everyone from event planning to session

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,280
moderators to stressed out partners

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,520
this conference wouldn't be possible

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,560
without you so thank you all

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,919
so so much for making this possible

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
and back to you langdon

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,759
all right clicking all the buttons uh so

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
this is the part

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,280
at the uh welcome that we try to give

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,840
you a little bit about the

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
how to conference um and so these are

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
kind of some of the key highlights

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
uh and we're gonna kind of go through a

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,880
few other points and

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,840
kind of tips first off one thing i want

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
to mention and

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,039
if you haven't uh kind of figured it out

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
by now uh

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,160
the code of conduct for this conference

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
is uh

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
important to us okay it's not just a

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
piece of paper

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,520
as it were or digital papers or

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
so the kind of core message we want to

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,319
send is you know the

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
bill and ted's external adventure be

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
excellent to each other

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
the idea here is that we have lots of

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,280
new speakers we have lots of new

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,919
conference goers

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
so if you want to provide criticism

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,120
that's usually appreciated

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
however you want to be careful about

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
being constructive about it

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
if you want to you know kind of

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
communicate with somebody else at the

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,400
conference

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
you know that's great and that's it

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720
really important to the conference

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but again be respectful be constructive

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
and those things are really important to

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
this conference we want to make sure

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,960
that this is a comfortable experience

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
for everyone who's here

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
uh so that they're ready and you know

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
willing

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
to kind of go to the next big conference

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
and so that way we can

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
uh you know kind of give you a baseline

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,720
as a speaker or as an attendee

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
about what's so great about conferences

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
and how to manage those

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,680
um and so we need all of you to

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,840
participate in that

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
if you do have uh a problem with the

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
kind of code of conduct like you

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
you see something that you're

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,720
uncomfortable with please let us know

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
uh you know it's a lot easier to find us

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,599
in uh kind of the global chat than it is

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
uh running around on the floor of a of a

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
you know in-person conference

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,280
uh so definitely reach out to us if you

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
have any problems whatsoever

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,560
uh and let us know if you have any

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,639
trouble contacting

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,479
uh the co-chairs you know myself sally

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
or avashi

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,400
you know definitely check out the dev

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
conf booth

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,440
and so what we did this year to kind of

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
have a help desk

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,599
is we actually made a booth about the

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
conference in the expo hall

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,440
so if you notice in the navigation that

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,039
is probably on your left

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
of your browser or could be on the

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,599
bottom depending on the size of the

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
screen you have set up

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
uh it says expo and in that area you'll

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
find if you scroll down a bit you'll

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
find the

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
devconf booth there is great information

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,560
there

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,919
um for example some of the stuff that

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,879
we're gonna show right here

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,319
um and uh there's also always someone

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,360
there to help you out so if you have a

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,360
technical problem

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,560
you're uh you know you're a speaker and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,400
you're worried about how to

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
uh you know kind of run your show we can

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,520
help you with whatever you need

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,800
um and uh you know basically just making

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,599
sure that you can have a successful

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
conference

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
um the other thing i want to point out

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,479
is you know the the overlays i did

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,080
uh using purely open source software uh

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,639
so it's an open source kernel driver

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,319
uh on fedora and then uh obs on top of

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,080
that and hopefully it's not gonna fall

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,440
over in the middle of this presentation

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,120
um but with all of that i wanted to hand

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,240
it off to sally who's gonna talk

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
a little bit more about how the

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,520
conference works

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,120
to add to that he has a script that he

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,320
might share with you in the chat if you

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
ask if you would like to

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,839
also have those overlays but since it

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,320
did crash i opted out for this

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,959
conference

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
so our conference is divided by tracks

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,200
or rooms

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
we cut we we wanted to keep it simple so

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
you find

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,760
the talk you want to go to in the

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,279
schedule and

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,040
each track um and and then each session

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,600
in the schedule has a video stream

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
button

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
that video stream button will bring you

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,720
back to the room

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,680
and hop in each track or room it's

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,160
continuous

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,040
sessions speakers attendees they'll pop

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,720
in and out

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,320
all day it's similar to in-person events

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
between talks you'll hear the moderator

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,560
and speaker talking about mics

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
or slides and we encourage you to use

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,959
the chat between sessions

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
and we encourage you to ask questions in

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
the chat

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,760
during the sessions for the speaker

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,519
so yeah again there's a video stream

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
link in the schedule for each session

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
that should bring you to the right room

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
and hop in

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,760
the schedule is the source of truth to

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,320
find the individual sessions

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,640
so one other point are our speakers

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
aren't professional video editors

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,160
um this some of them this is their first

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
time uh

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,279
giving a talk at all much less recording

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
it

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
so please send them love encouragement

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,560
make it positive

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,279
um when you when you attend the sessions

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
however i have previewed the talks and i

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,560
am

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
blown away at how good they are i wish i

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,519
could

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
sit in every single session and just

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
watch them all and

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,640
that brings me to my final point um

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
after each session

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,279
if there is a pre-recorded link it will

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
be uploaded to that video stream button

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,160
in schedule

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
so after the session's over that video

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
stream will point to

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,079
the pre-recorded session if the session

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
was live which some of them are

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,279
you'll get the hop-in recording as soon

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,040
as it's made available to us

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,360
i think that those are my points so

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,920
hershey uh you have some more things

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
yep um i'm sure a lot of you will be

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,120
having

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,079
conversations after and or during the

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
sessions

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
uh so if you want to continue those

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,320
conversations elsewhere we have breakout

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,920
rooms under the expo tab for each track

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
you can go there and share your audio

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,360
video to have lively and respectful

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,279
discussions

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
we all need to keep our tummies happy so

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,920
we have arranged for some delicious food

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000

when you do

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
particularly in the last year

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,279
or so is to look back at the golden

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,959
thread and it's not like some

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,040
definition meeting on what a golden

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,320
thread is

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,720
but particularly we kind of

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
refer to this and in my household and

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,760
you know

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,240
loved ones of like looking at that that

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,399
thing that thing that connects

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,760
either all of us or your history or

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,160
whatever it is

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,560
um that's so fine but you usually can

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
only see that glimmering

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,759
piece of your own uh history in

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,800
hindsight so what is that golden thread

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,000
um sally holy moly knocked it out with

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,320
an introduction

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
never had an introduction like that but

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,360
um

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,880
honestly i'm still hands on keyboard

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,120
individual contributor nerd and

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,800
otherwise but have had

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
a number of different dabblings over the

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
years and i'll get into this more in a

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,199
second but

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,440
um if if you

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,560
have questions or have had experience in

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,480
any one of these things feel free to

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
reach out to me because i'm i'm excited

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,920
to

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,600
jump into pretty much any one of those

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,120
pieces so

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
um real quickly one of the things that

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,199
this

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,000
talk you know is probably not going to

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,360
be

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,519
is any kind of figurative literal

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,040
chemical spiritual blowing your brains

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
out your butts it's just not going to be

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
that kind of a talk

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,759
if at any point you know something is of

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,120
use to you

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,160
great um i

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,160
i i pay a lot of respect and you know

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,240
when teachers convey a message and

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,480
there's a lot of responsibility in that

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
um and there's there's nothing precise

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,279
that i'm saying that you should do

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,880
or you know that will work for you um at

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,880
best i'm going to

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,440
try and honestly cover a little bit of

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,720
what i found worked for me

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
and probably some of the embarrassing

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,240
things along the way that have gotten me

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
here

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
the the first thing is really that

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,799
i'll talk a little bit about goals and

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,799
this was like when when the topic came

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,959
up of like well you changed jobs this

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,640
year and that's exciting and

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,880
you did it during a pandemic and that

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,959
probably was not the smartest thing

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,400
even even chris wright even said

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,520
bless your heart um speaking very much

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,880
to my alabama

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,120
uh raising um

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
but i even to go from a big company to a

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,000
very you know small intimate

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,600
uh company at kinfolk so what what

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,080
brought you here and this got me

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,919
thinking

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,400
a little bit further to um

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,360
what did get me here and and some of

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
that is

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,600
like there was a time 10 or 15 years ago

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,360
that i wrote

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,559
a 5 10 15 year goal for myself and this

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,559
this is

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
a little fluffy but it's it's one of

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,880
these things that

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,240
hey i'm not a list making person i've

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
gotten much better at it

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
now but i've never been good at list

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
making

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,559
um so it was monumental to sit down and

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
write a list

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,280
um that was great but what were the kind

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
of things on it and i don't have the

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,840
original list anymore

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,799
it it was so private to me that it kind

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,160
of just

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,039
it iterated for for a long time

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,240
and at that time 15 this was closer to

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,679
20 years ago

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
for me personally was to have more

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
options than beans and rice

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,080
um and along that same line is to

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,720
not miss on uh rent or critical bills or

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,640
otherwise

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,360
um that's very very very real

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
to me um you know the point at which you

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
have to like

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,919
sell off uh musical instruments so that

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,240
you can pay your rent

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
is not always an uplifting experience

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,039
but it will fortify

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,080
uh motivation

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,200
i i was working on open source in my off

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
time

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
and learning you know learning and

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
hacking on it

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,080
but the idea that you could ever make a

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
meaningful contribution to a project was

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,960
beyond me like i had

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,919
no idea i was mostly like what thing

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,080
could i do

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,000
you know and kind of an extension of

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,120
that but like one of these penultimate

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,039
things is like

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,880
to get a commit into the kernel and like

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,400
whatever um i had

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,039
i had wished and you know hoped to go

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
out of the country at all much less to

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,600
actually have to do that

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,799
for work uh and then i had a goal

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:43,039
that one day probably you know

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,039
when i'm 40s and 50s years old

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
to be the cto you know start a company

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,520
and

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,320
act as the cto of it

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,120
or whatever lead person whatever i had

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,160
no idea what that

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,760
would entail but um these were like kind

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,480
of goals for myself

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,919
um and so don't get me wrong i i

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
actually legitimately love beans and

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,000
rice but

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
it is a very cheap meal and

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
um thankfully i did not ruin it for

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
myself eating as much beans and rice as

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,240
i

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,559
did in fact it's still like a lot of

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,559
beans and rice but

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,559
so let's let's let's let's roll back

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,559
just a little bit um

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:26,799
i worked with my dad and my dad

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,200
owned his own job uh self-employed

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,000
lightning protection we cleaned hood and

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
vent

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,400
um hood and vents for kitchens and

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,840
chimney sweep whether that makes sense

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,159
in alabama or not

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
it meant a lot of bricklaying it meant a

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
lot of

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,520
dirt and filth and

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,799
if you ever needed motivation for

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,480
something that you would

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,520
be like i you know could i make

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
money with computers probably like yeah

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
there's

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,600
fancy stuff but i just kind of like

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,919
hacking on open source software

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
and uh i guess i'll pay my bills doing

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,080
this

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,360
um and that became motivation um

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,720
so this is this is a unglamorous picture

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
there's probably other unglamorous

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,200
pictures of this time but

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,240
um whether i was singing chimney chimp

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,360
chim-chimney

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,600
in a penguin tail tux and a top hat or

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,600
this this is what it looks like

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,480
and on the side i would be involved in

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,640
the local linux user group i was

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,600
in fact at some point we helped

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,039
coordinate like an alabama lug fest

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,799
and that was that side um

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,240
the crazy part was that even even

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,720
getting involved in like the

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,159
linux user groups and talking to other

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,720
ones across the state or even the

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,720
southeast

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,000
i was blown away by how many people

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,840
were similarly not

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,080
you know like software professionals

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,880
by profession um there was people

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,120
from being plumbers to tv technician

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,640
repair people or

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
even working like in the anatomy

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
department of the university or whatever

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,400
like none of them like very few of them

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,600
were actually

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,960
like i t software people uh and

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,520
even those that were were mind-blowingly

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
you know from you know all different

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,200
kinds

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,919
um it was amazing and every time i

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
showed up

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,600
i was always asking lots of questions

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
and i was

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,960
uh um impressed by who the experts in

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,080
the room were

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,280
and it was great and it was always like

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
i was so eager to learn and effectively

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,880
come home

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,240
into my you know basement or whatever

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,640
and find something to tinker on

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,480
and you know basically create

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
challenges for myself to learn something

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,039
new whether it was like

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,520
automated installs or just running a

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,840
wordpress website or i don't know what

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,440
um and so then i'd go back and i'd find

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,880
other people that knew more than i did

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
in that particular area and i'd pester

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
them with questions until they

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,840
probably exhausted with me would send me

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,080
to you know

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
somebody else who knew more or whatever

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,880
um it was it was just

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,480
a pattern um but this was like

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:30,880
after our stuff and i don't

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,000
think i realized how much i was

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,039
able to self learn using basically the

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
power and access

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,280
the accessibility in open source whether

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,640
it's not just the people or what but

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,919
just that you could

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,279
self teach yourself how to program or

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,679
how to do any of this stuff and

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:52,240
actually learn skills that were hireable

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,960
that part was had not connected in my

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,880
brain yet

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,679
and uh it's something that only looking

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,760
back like i i fully realized like oh

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,440
i i taught myself how to run a database

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,640
and therefore i eventually was paid

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,640
to do these things

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:11,760
and that yeah

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:16,880
it was that was pretty

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,880
um much a hindsight looking back thing

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,240
and in that situation one of the

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,120
patterns that i saw is that you're

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
always always

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,480
seeking out the expert in a particular

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
area and

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,080
i think one of the good things that that

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,279
did for me uh is

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
because it was so low-key and because i

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,840
realized that the

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,039
experts were frequently you know

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,720
all different situations that they were

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,720
all just regular people to me

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,799
um and that it it it made very real that

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,880
sometimes these people that

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,000
get treated like rock stars or whatever

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,799
um celebrity

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,760
in their own situation are also just

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,919
people and they are

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,520
like they just happen to know or have

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,120
experience with the thing that you're

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,559
um now trying to learn

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,360
so seek them out um

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,200
and one of the secondary side effects is

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,279
this got me very comfortable

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,320
um with the fact of not being the

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,279
smartest person

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,480
you know in us a certain situation uh or

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,520
even further when you're finding

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,880
yourself

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,520
trying to discover a new um technology

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
or whatever it is uh or even a team that

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,200
you're on

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,799
later like that sounds like work talk

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,559
being on the team but

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,919
is to not be the smartest person in the

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,840
room

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,159
um you can take this to mean some of

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,120
that aspect of like humility

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,159
but i also mean this in like true

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,960
literal sense of like

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,320
if you want to just learn stuff by

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,480
osmosis and like

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,640
be exposed to discussions that you might

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,840
have no idea about and are interested in

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
learning about

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
um then then like put yourself into

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
places where you

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,039
you no longer are the smartest person in

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,840
the room so that you actively must

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,120
listen

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,240
um and ask questions uh

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,320
it's it is not always the most

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,640
comfortable thing because that

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,080
as i was talking about in a second it it

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,600
frequently leads to awkward

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,760
and effectively vulnerable situations so

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,200
there was an aspect of becoming

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,400
comfortable with being

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,240
vulnerable and uh

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,919
it's not something that's easy but and

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,080
i'm not saying that you should do this

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,960
because there's times to protect

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,400
vulnerability uh there's a time to not

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
put everything in the world out there

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,799
but there's

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
there's places where you're like uh

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,760
effectively having to get a little

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
comfortable with the fact that you're

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,200
not

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,039
the most comfortable you know you're not

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,840
the most smart person or whatever in the

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,760
room

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,200
and um not everybody can do this and

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,600
but that's that's fine because that

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
means we know we've all

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,520
witnessed the people that are like

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,679
either defensive about what

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,200
they know or defensive about what they

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,799
don't know

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,400
they might choose to be an about

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,000
it and they'll

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,799
make a name for themselves in that way

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,799
and people will

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,080
treat him accordingly so uh this is

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,679
again

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,440
find what works right for you but there

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
is some aspect and at least the

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,799
discussion topic around

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,240
allowing yourself this vulnerability um

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,520
because for me i realized that it was

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,520
this was a part of my iteration

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,520
um and the the crazy part was that

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,880
at some point after exposing yourself in

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,080
these situations

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,240
um and even in some places like i

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,000
uh some of my first contributions to

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,159
various projects were either

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,679
simple like trying to get something to

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,440
compile but most often it was

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,720
documentation

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,080
and um there were times when

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,200
yeah obviously i didn't know what i was

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,919
doing but i was frustrated with

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,679
um trying to use something and i

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,559
realized that it was the docs that were

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,720
sucking not that

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,399
the code was particularly bad itself

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
and so i would make changes to the docs

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,480
and then there was this like

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
massive role reversal at some point this

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
the

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
first one that came to mind when i was

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,840
thinking about this was um

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,240
making doc docs changes in

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,520
the ssl c api

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,120
bindings for ruby and uh i was

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,799
doing something with ssl tls and ruby

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,520
at the time and the documentation was so

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
bad

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,480
oh gosh it was so bad and uh i

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,760
effectively started filling out most of

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,960
the docs for

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,799
that library because uh i i needed to

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,919
use them and i was confident that they

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,440
were

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,799
so bad there was such a lack of

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,080
documentation that i was going to misuse

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:54,320
and probably implement the ssl tls stuff

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,000
wrong just because the docs were bad and

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,760
that's fine i was doing it for myself

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,960
and then one day somebody pinged me to

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,640
say

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,000
that they were looking at like one

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,520
version of ruby and were getting

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,279
frustrated and then they

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720
you know the next release came out that

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,320
actually had docks

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,159
and it answered the problems that they

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,200
could then like kind of retrofit to

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,960
prior versions um and they were

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,600
they were so they were relieved enough

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,039
about it

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,679
that they were able that they were

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,679
willing to find me on something like irc

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,760
and let me know that i fixed a problem

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
that they were having and

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,880
immediately i realized that this uh

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,440
resource of open source the successful

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,799
resource of open source

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,840
um is now something that i'm like

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,480
i'm indebted to because i it's

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,880
it's like i have i have like this

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,120
responsibility

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
to that i've made a difference for

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,399
somebody

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
um and i'm kind of like yeah i've

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,440
self-taught myself and i've done so

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,559
so until the point that somebody else

00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,000
um recognized it and um

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,159
for me that was amazing and and

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,240
i had had other times when obviously i'd

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,080
like broken compiles and stuff like that

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,840
it's it's people are more quick to tell

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,919
you that you broke something then

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,080
you fixed something but it was it was um

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,600
it was kind of a milestone for me um

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,159
that that you could like make a

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,679
difference

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,000
for other people and well i just said

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,320
this

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,679
but still that it became kind of this

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,919
reciprocal relationship

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,440
that not that i was making changes or

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,919
improvements

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,720
specifically for the greater good often

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,559
it was because

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,159
either i had contrived a challenge for

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,720
myself

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,240
or a use case or i was working for

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
something that i actually wanted to see

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,559
working and the side effects were that i

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,919
helped others

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,520
and that line got very gray a number of

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,679
times and whatever it was

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:55,039
that was the motivation at that time

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,159
um still kept the purpose that i vincent

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,120
bats was working on

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,320
something and if if it was going to be

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,399
beneficial then

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,960
you know it had to be good for everybody

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,440
and that led me to the very very very

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,039
real

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,080
like re reflection now that what you do

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,840
and truly how you do it um whether you

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,000
like

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,320
choose to make it good for both parties

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,919
or at least engaging for both parties or

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,600
whether you like choose to be an

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,840
about it that's your own choice

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,159
um what you do and how you do it does

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,080
make a difference

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
something that i've found myself saying

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,480
even to my kids

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,519
is like you don't exist in a vacuum you

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,080
don't exist in

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,440
isolation like it is we're all

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,559
interdependent

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,559
um and so you you can

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,799
pursue your path and realize that you're

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,840
having cascading effects on others and

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,159
it might be

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,080
years before somebody comes back and

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,840
says that time that you said something

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,440
to me you know or gave me this pointer

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,880
or this encouragement

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,960
years ago made a difference

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,559
it might be so much in passing that you

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,559
will never hear that

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,720
but you must realize you don't exist in

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,039
a vacuum at all

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,320
um so like it's a bunker's concept i

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,159
know but

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,760
you you must must realize that and uh

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,240
it's probably uncomfortable to think

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,039
about it to some extent

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,000
um and so for me like like what is what

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,880
is

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
making this difference and like i i went

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,519
from tinkering on

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
open source stuff and you know my

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,720
basement or whatever like area

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,519
um to making like life commitments with

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,600
a partner

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,360
um uh wishing to eat whether it was

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,159
beans and rice or otherwise

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,720
uh at some point i was able to make a

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,519
the switch from um

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,559
sweeping chimneys and you know cheese

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,159
louise i did door-to-door cells and

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,600
awaiting tables and stuff like that to

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,880
getting like a job

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,640
at the i.t department at a bank

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,399
that was monumental it didn't pay good

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,200
but it was monumental for me because it

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,240
was like

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,279
somebody recognized that you were

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,919
you had skills that they were willing to

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,360
pay for

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,279
um kids came along and around the same

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,000
time uh

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,480
not only did i get on with the bank i.t

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,159
but i

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,440
actually got denied because i had

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,320
dropped out of university i thought

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,120
university was

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,799
ridiculous and so i was denied because i

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,640
didn't i couldn't check a checkbox that

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,760
i had a

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,679
degree and i still also wanted to eat

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,360
so um with kids and job and

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,120
you know everything like this i also

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,399
went back and finished university

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,519
and um it it that process

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,080
kind of hardened my motivation in that

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,320
way and

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,840
i i really some of these words are so

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,480
squishy i can't believe i'm saying them

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,840
but

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,519
it really for as 80d as i am as much as

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,080
i don't like making lists

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,960
there's times when it's like oh this is

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,240
the reason that i'm

00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,559
you know doing these things and

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
it sometimes takes being real with

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,039
yourself of like why it is that you're

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,279
even

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,560
doing that because

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,520
without having some kind of process and

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,399
this is true for

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,320
teams this is why teams do retros or

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,960
whatever is like what worked what didn't

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,200
work

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,879
do this for yourself um

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,159
i i don't like having choices in life

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,879
but it's better that you make

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,839
decisions for yourself like given a

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,200
choice

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,639
and uh you know like yeah i don't like

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,800
decisions they're the worst

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,679
or choices but it's better that you do

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,919
that for yourself

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,079
than somebody else making that choice

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,480
for you uh and so sometimes you kind of

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,440
like

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,240
i realize there's times when choices are

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,639
made for you but i'm saying like

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,079
would i rather do this to improve myself

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,480
or ignore it

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,680
and uh see what happens in five years

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,520
make the decision for yourself

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,280
because and i don't mean like someone

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,599
specifically but like

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,960
the world life will make that decision

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,240
for you and

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,160
it's better that you be involved in the

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,079
process

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,440
um and so some of those big crazy

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,480
choices for us were

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,680
the jump from alabama to northern

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,720
virginia dc

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,480
area that was a bonkers move

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
arguably too big of a move because

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,640
i liked the company that i was working

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,880
for and i liked a lot of people that i

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,079
got to work with in that area but it was

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440
a choice that i was

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,040
quickly looking to change um

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,200
and i was looking to get closer to the

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,000
blue ridge mountains uh

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,880
keep keep and maintain a pace and speed

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,440
of mind

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,359
that was important for us uh and there

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,760
was just happened to be this little

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,880
company in raleigh uh so that was that

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,880
was around

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,000
2012. um worked at red hat

00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,480
for eight years and it blew my

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,079
mind like i never imagined never never

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,359
never never never imagined working

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,119
uh for red hat i always suspected that i

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,480
would do

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,920
something for pay and i would hack on

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,760
you know open source on the side and

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:21,839
it was amazing and i don't i don't deter

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,839
anybody from doing that um

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,040
it it's it it was yeah mind-blowing i

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,760
don't know what else to say

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,240
the big thing that it did do for me

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,400
though

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,240
is it kind of crashed two worlds

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,760
together because in my mind there were

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,960
there was like a pretty little ribbon

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
around one thing and a pretty little

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,800
ribbon around the other thing and now it

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,520
was like

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,560
i needed to find new hobbies because uh

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,720
the stuff that i did

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,920
after hours was now the stuff that i did

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,839
during work and so

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,680
it was way too easy to bring work home

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,960
with me and there is kind of a benefit

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,079
mixed advantage to that but um not to

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,320
feel like you're

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,320
you know your hobbies are now

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,760
professionally motivated i'm not always

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,240
a firm believer of

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,680
um getting paid to do what you love like

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,280
there's there's

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,960
there's a personal and artistic and

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,520
creative side of things and then there

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,040
is

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,240
um strict kind of like business

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,880
to things also so i did

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,280
get into i went back and found music

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,119
again

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,000
and it was great this is a picture of my

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,760
grandfather

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,079
and at some point over the years uh

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,680
i came in contact with his accordion

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,760
and picked that up for a number of years

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,119
but um that was one of the biggest

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,520
things is that

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,359
uh kind of picking up and pulling these

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,240
these music back into my life and there

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,599
was other things

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,720
i'm not a big tv watcher i

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,240
actually have never been um

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,720
i don't i don't play i intentionally

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,440
don't play a lot of video games either

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,560
so if i'm not like outside in the woods

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,599
and it's usually

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,280
family and music and otherwise but i'm

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,400
making a firm delineation of

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,680
things that are like work whether it is

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,160
open source for the fun

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,160
and love of it uh or if it's actually

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,599
something for my own

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,480
self and well-being um

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
because the the part that you must kind

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,000
of keep in mind

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,520
is that in open source we are all

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
individual contributors and i hear that

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,560
that term sometimes used as if like

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,160
that's your role

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,760
um like i'm an ic but

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,880
uh at the end of the day if you make

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,960
you know whatever comments on

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,079
on an open source issue mailing list or

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,920
whatever whatever

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,599
uh that's your name that's attached to

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,560
it um and that will

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,640
carry after you leave even if you create

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,079
a github account that's per company

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,920
that's it's still you um

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,440
so these things are all interconnected

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,680
even your

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,839
self so there's there's a

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,000
personal aspect to this and not just

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,680
like

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,520
i'm not saying like don't do what's

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,000
right for the company also

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,760
my point is that there is a personal

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,960
burden of responsibility

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,800
to do the right thing and

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,320
you'll feel that whether you're working

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,240
during the day or the weekends or

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,880
whatever

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,520
and it's it's very very important even

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,400
for your own

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,440
mental health to stay true to that

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,359
because

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,359
you you'll you'll carry that with you

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,400
um big big funny thing i mean like

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,480
any any time that you have something

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
that now like i'm i'm passionate about

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,720
certain projects or i'm passionate about

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,359
certain technologies um

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,839
and then you you are thrusting yourself

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,839
to be

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,560
in the room with smarter people uh

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,200
you're destined for awkward situations

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,760
um

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,960
so this i don't know if that's quite

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,240
being vulnerable or what but

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,320
like like you're destined to find

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,680
yourself in awkward situations and

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,440
uh that there's so many times when

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,119
um uh

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,200
okay so i did i ended up not going back

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,839
to school for computer science

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,440
it i was going i was working for a bank

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,880
and they were willing to pay for an

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,960
accounting degree so

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,319
i went for like business and accounting

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
uh that's great whatever there's so much

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,960
stuff that i

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
i missed out on by not going to

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,280
university for this and one of the first

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
you know big challenges that i got to

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,040
tackle when i had joined

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
red hat was you know kind of a

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,119
compression situation there was like

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,839
this

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,400
time when a ex-avenue certificate was

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,720
getting put

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,480
put through an http header and if it got

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,400
too big it would get truncated and

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,079
we had to like fit more stuff in the

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,960
smaller box

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,359
uh and that was one of the times when i

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,760
got

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,520
my brain got wound around some axle and

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,880
i was working on it i'm like

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,800
thinking about it in the nights and like

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,839
woke up you know thinking about this

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,599
silly problem um

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,280
not not because it was like a work

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,319
initiative but but just it was kind of a

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,000
puzzle

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,400
and i came into the office and started

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,880
like describing the situation to

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,839
the other people on the team and some of

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,200
them like had

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,520
masters in computer science and

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,720
they were like vince you just described

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
like various

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,560
type like they like send me wikipedia

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,200
pages to like a radix tree or a huffman

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,359
tree

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,280
and i'm like this is exactly what we're

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,520
talking like what we need to do and

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,319
that you know it was it yeah it was

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,760
totally like

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,040
this was me like i was like yay we

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
found the problem and they're like this

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,240
is textbook like you should you should

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,000
have gone to college for the stuff

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,240
um but thankfully we there there were

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,160
a lot of smart people in the room and

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,920
this is something that later turned into

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,720
like a patent with a few people involved

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,440
and

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,079
um it was not just radics and huffman

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,119
trees but

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,440
a few other things um but

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,880
you know if i had gotten defensive and

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,720
you know yelled and screamed that

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,400
like why didn't anybody tell me these

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,800
things

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,440
the situation could have gone poorly but

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,119
it

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,560
it kind of embraced that that

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,960
awkwardness and um

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,440
ability to laugh it off and something

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,680
might come out of it so

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,680
uh other times that that i i think

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,359
similar things have happened is that

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,200
because i approach

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,280
yeah you have approached things in a

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,359
situation where you can kind of laugh it

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,200
off or at least like brainstorm

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,640
with the smarter people is that

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,640
sometimes your ideas get mixed into

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,640
their ideas and

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,160
this is one that i can't say works for

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,839
everybody

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,079
because i think that people should

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,560
always get their attribution but

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,160
do realize that it's almost like a form

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,240
of flattery that

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,920
if you put yourself in the situations

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,880
with people that sometimes

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,040
the the good outcome that actually

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,280
solves the problem

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,079
might be part of your idea but it might

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,880
be somebody else's

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,480
implementation of it and you can hope

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,640
and wish and hopefully you'll have

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,240
advocates there that will make sure that

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,200
you get

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,440
uh recognized for those things but um

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
the

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,119
at the end of the day at least for me

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
one of the biggest important things is

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,040
that

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,319
the right solution was arrived at um

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,400
even if it was somebody else's

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,359
implementation so

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,119
um this is this kind of border

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,240
borderlines on the vulnerability piece

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,880
that it's

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,359
uh the the best possible out you know or

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,480
you know

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,720
a very good outcome um even if

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,960
things could have been better so uh

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,880
realize that those things are kind of

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:45,200
mixed up together um

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,960
so in in kind of a recap it it really

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,560
does become kind of an indebted

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,119
responsibility um

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,920
i could not have done anything that i've

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,200
you know done

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,560
without uh open source my you know my

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,240
my fine golden thread would have been

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,560
completely different

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,680
um and then how how to engage in those

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,359
situations

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,920
um is kind of a constant reflection

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,720
process

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,359
and allowing yourself uh the space to

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,760
you know space and humor to do that like

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,880
find your humor and how how it works

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,480
together

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,079
um and then lastly like i said

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
motivations i that word

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,720
still sounds so squishy to me but it is

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,480
how i prioritize like what is

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,680
the most important thing right now and

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,000
the most important thing right now might

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,920
be

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,640
just the person that you're sitting with

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,079
um not your list of to-do's

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,000
but the way and the nature and the topic

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,359
and how you're helping them to make it

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,319
actually useful

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,800
um is still part of that motivation so

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,680
find what's important

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,680
and um

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,960
that that is what i mean by the looking

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,240
back

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,720
at the golden thread and to to be

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,800
honest with yourself er

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,240
is even to acknowledge all the other

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,680
things that i can

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,599
tell you that um

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
part of even why i keep saying this is

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,680
what worked for me and doesn't work for

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,319
other you know

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,319
you know whatever is that there are

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,280
always other things that factor into it

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,480
and you know like i i i cannot rule out

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,119
the fact that there

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,520
is privilege that plays into this you

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,960
know

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,520
and and there is it's not just dumb luck

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,359
um and uh it you know i can't say that

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
it feels like there was a lot of hard

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,240
work and whatever

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,599
but uh and i'm not saying that i've

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,079
arrived either jesus christ

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,760
like um i'm i'm just saying that like

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
when you look back at what got you to

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,520
where you are

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,599
be very real with yourself um

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,560
because if if i want and also to

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,520
acknowledge that

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,000
you know how best to help others is to

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,670
acknowledge

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,789
things like um

00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,789
[Music]

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,960
your your life situation privilege and

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,200
otherwise then

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,520
you might be completely tone deaf to

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,040
even engage with other people so

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,560
this this is part of that hindsight as

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,520
well and realizing that

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,400
um it's a constant education process and

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,319
it's a constant improvement process so

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:15,119
um yeah with that i think most people

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,000
it feel free to reach out to me find me

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,920
um and with that

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,680
i think we might be able to take a few

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,119
questions but otherwise

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,839
thank you uh vincent you're awesome as i

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,880
pointed out

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,359
before your talk and

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,520
i've been following the chat the stage

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,480
chat and it's just

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,520
so what i can say is that your story

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,680
resonates

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,760
for so many that's exactly what carson

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,520

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:49,040
many um people were just

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,160
so um excited to hear that like

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,240
they could see themselves in you and

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,359

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,040
um prompted this amazing

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,359
dialogue in the chat that you couldn't

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,480
see but we were all just

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:28,000
just like sharing with you the fact that

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,160

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,599
thank you for being so honest and being

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,640
yourself and

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,640
um for me a quote that came into my mind

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,720
while i was

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,760
listening to you is that every day i'm

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,000
at work um

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,599
at work being like right here in my in

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,079
my house but and

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,280
and i say like um you know i know i've

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,680
made some good choices

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,960
in my life when i'm at doing my work at

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,880
work and i'm like

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,720
thinking i can't believe i get paid for

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,359
this because i think that

00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,880
every day like i'm doing my my work and

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,800
i can't believe i actually get paid for

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,480
this this is so awesome and

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,119
it it and like you

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,520
it took me so long to figure that out um

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,640
well

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,760
into my 30s you know well past yeah i

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,119
just

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,520
yeah yeah and and even that one like

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,720
it is there's always a don't don't ever

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,880
think that you you missed

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,280
the opportunity my whole life i would

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,720
yeah i would be frustrated i'd be like

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,640
gosh i should have you know i wish i

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,480
would have done this but you said

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,680
in hindsight you can look back when

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,880
you're when you're at a place you can

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,119
look back and say oh

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,920
like i had to go through all that stuff

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,520
before because it's what brought me here

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,520
so yeah you just yeah

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,720
yeah i mean like it would be a

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,000
an all it would be much longer talk

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,520
especially as

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
i would want to hear everybody else's

00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,760
stories but when you start realizing

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,680
like

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,200
even the little things of like oh yeah i

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,800
did you know have

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,240
exposure to this kind of personality for

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,599
a long time i guess that fully prepared

00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,880
me for now exposing

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,119
being you know dealing with these other

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,520
kind of personalities now uh or

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,960
this like you you start just looking

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,240
back at those kind of conversations and

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,000
realizing that

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,359
like things have prepared you for this

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,359
moment right now so

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:14,839

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,119

factored in

00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,160
