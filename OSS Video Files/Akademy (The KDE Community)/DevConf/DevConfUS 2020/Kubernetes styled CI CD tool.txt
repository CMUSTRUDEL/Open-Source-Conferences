	Speaker: Harshad Reddy Nalla

In the container world, the emphasis is on the easy build and ship. CI/CD for the container tools should also work on a similar principle of easy build and deploy. Many of the CI/CD tools present are designed before the existence of cloud-native paradigms which makes it difficult to run in containerized environments like Kubernetes. OpenShift Pipelines builds upon the Tekton project to enable Kubernetes-style delivery pipelines that remove the need to rely on central teams to maintain and manage a CI server and can fully control and own the complete lifecycle of their microservices. Utilizing the power of Openshift Pipelines and Tekton trigger we have designed and implement our own Thoth-CI to facilitate the projects which have multi-namespace microservice architecture.
This talk is about how our ci/cd tool is providing ease to the developer to work on source code and not worry about deploying the project to containerized environments and its configuration.
