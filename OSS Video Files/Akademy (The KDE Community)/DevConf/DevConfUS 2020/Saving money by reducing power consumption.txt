Monitoring and reducing the energy consumption of servers in data centers is critical. Reducing the power drawn by 10,000 datacenter servers by 10 watts (10 joules/second) would result in energy savings that could power approximately 100 US households with a corresponding financial saving of $100,000/year. The factors that affect a server's energy use arise from the complex interactions between the application workload, software stack, and the hardware characteristics and configuration of the node itself. This work sheds light on the task of tuning hardware parameters to control the time and energy required for IO sensitive, system-centric workloads typical of cloud services. In a memcached server, hardware tuning using both Linux and a library OS and record dramatic savings of 440 joules 42%) on Linux and 635 joules 60% on a library OS while maintaining an 99% tail latency under 500 microsecond. We reveal the significant impact that static tuning can have and the influence of operating systems software on the performance of the aforementioned applications.
