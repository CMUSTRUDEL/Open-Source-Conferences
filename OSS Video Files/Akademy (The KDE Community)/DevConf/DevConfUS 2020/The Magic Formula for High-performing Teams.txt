In 2015, Google published the results of an internal study to determine what factors were the best predictors of an employee’s success. Their thesis was that the study would uncover what individual traits and past accomplishments were predictors of future performance, ultimately leading to a "magical algorithm" for hiring the right people. They learned that the highest performing teams had a number of common traits, but the most impactful one was an environment of psychological safety. Many want this environment but are left wondering how you grow a team culture that encourages experiments to flourish and treats failures as an opportunity for continuous learning.

In this session, we’ll discuss helping groups overcome communication and cultural anti-patterns that destroy psychological safety. You'll leave this presentation with actionable strategies to create a trust-filled environment that fosters employee well-being, creativity, and innovation.
