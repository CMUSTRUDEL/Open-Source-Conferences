Title: The Magic Formula for High-performing Teams
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Leslie Hawthorn & Jen Krieger

In 2015, Google published the results of an internal study to determine what factors were the best predictors of an employee’s success. Their thesis was that the study would uncover what individual traits and past accomplishments were predictors of future performance, ultimately leading to a "magical algorithm" for hiring the right people. They learned that the highest performing teams had a number of common traits, but the most impactful one was an environment of psychological safety. Many want this environment but are left wondering how you grow a team culture that encourages experiments to flourish and treats failures as an opportunity for continuous learning.

In this session, we’ll discuss helping groups overcome communication and cultural anti-patterns that destroy psychological safety. You'll leave this presentation with actionable strategies to create a trust-filled environment that fosters employee well-being, creativity, and innovation.

vertical community strategy

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
in the open source program office in the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,040
office of the cto at red hut

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,200
and today jen and i will be talking to

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,760
you about how to create high performing

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
teams

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
some common barriers to accomplishing

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,840
that and how each of us as individuals

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,520
leaders and managers can contribute to

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
our team successfully getting stuff done

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,759
well

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,119
so uh to introduce the topic of our talk

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,320
today psychological safety i'd like to

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,920
give you a little bit of history on the

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,720
terminology and why it's come into the

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,479
common parlance of uh business discourse

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,200
of late so uh in 2015

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,439
uh google set out to do a an in-depth

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
study to understand what produces the

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,240
most uh successful engineering team

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,240
possible

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,479
and at the time google was well known

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,560
for an extremely rigorous hiring process

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
that focused on things like

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,799
the quality of education a candidate had

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,840
how many years of experience

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
in-depth knowledge of arcane algorithms

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
and a variety of other factors that they

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,560
felt would contribute to

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
building the most successful group of

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,280
people to build the world's best quality

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
products

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
and what they found after doing

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
interviews with um you know 200 plus

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
employees

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,160
and looking at more than 250 attributes

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
of successful teams

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
from more than 180 teams across the

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
company they discovered that

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
every single set of success criteria

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
they assumed

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,400
would create the best possible team had

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,040
nothing to do with reality and in fact

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,720
the top

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
factors for determining a successful

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
team were those that you see before you

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,640
psychological safety

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,760
dependability structure and clarity

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
meaningful work

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,680
and having impact and a high performing

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
team had all of those

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
attributes but the most important

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
attribute by far and away and in fact

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
the linchpin

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,000
for creating the other four attributes

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,599
was a psychological safety

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
the feeling that you're able to

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,200
successfully take risks and be

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
vulnerable in front of one another

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,480
and not have that diminish other

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,239
people's view of you

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,920
or their view of your ideas now

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,440
this was really surprising to the folks

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,879
who were running the survey who

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
expected you know to hear that actually

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,680
the answer is that you went to stanford

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
university and

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
had a phd in computer science but it

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
wasn't actually particularly surprising

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
for me

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
as someone who worked at google in the

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
early days and

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,680
didn't feel like i operated in an

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
environment of psychological safety

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,040
from my own personal experience right i

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
graduated from uc berkeley

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
which for folks who know anything about

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,000
stanford university and uc berkeley they

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,040
are rival schools

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,879
so i came from the the not nice school i

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
was one of the only

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,080
handful of women at that point working

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
in the engineering department

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
i didn't have a computer science degree

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
i had a degree in medieval english

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
literature

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,000
and i often felt like i just didn't

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,360
belong there

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,879
and maybe someone had made a mistake and

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
you know i was just waiting for the time

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
when someone figured out that

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
i wasn't really where i should be and

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,439
that i should work harder and harder and

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
harder and faster and faster and faster

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840
to prove myself and to prove that i

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,200
would be able to be

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
successful in the environment where i

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,760
was already successful in doing a good

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,799
job

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
so um i don't know how many of you in

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
the audience are

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
are this is resonating with you and

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
you're thinking yeah i've been in that

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
place and i bet all of you probably went

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
and looked for new jobs as quickly as

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,080
possible

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,639
right so instead of

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
focusing on the ways in which we aren't

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,919
feeling psychologically safe in our work

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,840
environments we'd like to talk about

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
ways that that environment is actually

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
created around us

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
and then ways that we can all overcome

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,160
that in our own personal experience

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,120
over to you jen so we're going to start

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
with five

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,360
common barriers to to achieving

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
psychological safety

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
um the first one being one that i am

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,880
very familiar with in my career

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
as a chief agilist and and you know 20

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
years of

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
working with teams and working with

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,240
people

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,440
in in high stress environments there

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
always seems to be this thing that

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
happens where

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,160
you could be in a team meeting and

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
you could be having a most wonderful

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,280
conversation about

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,880
some requirement that is meant to be

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,880
developed and

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,240
the team could all be open and chatting

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,080
and talking about

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,919
whatever it is that they they want to do

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
in order to solve the issue that is in

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,479
front of them

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,240
and in walks your cio and immediately

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,720
what i have observed happen

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
is everyone in the room shuts down it's

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
almost like

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
if the door was over here and everybody

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
was interacting with people right here

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
the second that cio

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,199
walks in everybody goes like this and

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,759
it's like

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
what what happens that dynamic in that

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
team what really happens

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,280
is it changes um almost almost like the

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
social structure in which decisions are

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,600
made

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
shifts and it is literally

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
it has literally happened at every

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,759
single company i have ever worked for

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
um every at least once a month i have

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
observed this even today working at a

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,039
company

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
like red hat where we really do want to

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,319
make

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
decisions based on the the best idea

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,039
winning

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
we still fall into this trap of the

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
highest paid person's opinion

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,720
um it is it is something that we

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,360
collectively own

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
it is something that isn't it's not like

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
somebody said we had to listen to the

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
cio

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
we just assume based on hierarchical

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
structure

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,960
that they must know the right answer to

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
any question that is on the table and

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,240
of course their answer must be the one

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,759
that we should go with right

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
does that sound familiar to everybody

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
because geez it certainly sounds

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
familiar to me

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
the other the other thing that i want to

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,160
talk about too

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,360
is this concept of imposter syndrome and

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,960
i recently had a very uh

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
interesting situation happen to me

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,400
because i joined a new team at red hat

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,440
um we had a relatively large reorg

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,080
and a changing of hands at the ceo level

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,000
and that impact impacted my team as well

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,599
and i joined a team of people that i

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,680
deeply respect and deeply look up to

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,560
they're extremely smart people

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,880
they have so much knowledge and i kind

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,919
of felt like i wasn't good enough like i

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,560
felt like

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,319
gosh if i say anything i'm gonna i'm

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,599
gonna put the cards on the table to show

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
everybody that i am

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
not an expert in anything i am not an

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
expert

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,560
in the situation and i'm not i'm not

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
good enough for this team

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
and you know the funny thing about that

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
is

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
i know better i know better i know

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
better on so many different levels

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,479
because my job

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
is literally to coach people out of

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
imposter syndrome

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,160
to help them understand that they don't

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,680
have to be air quote the greatest expert

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
to feel like they're good enough

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
they just have to be happy with

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,800
themselves

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,319
um but the strange thing that happened

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
was is one of these people that had

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,520
deeply respect

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,879
in a meeting just basically said you

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,240
know what i don't know the answer to

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
that question either

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,800
we should probably talk about that and i

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
suddenly realized that

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,080
you know what because i feel unsure

00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
because i don't

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
know the answer to everything doesn't

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
necessarily mean

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
that there's something wrong with me it

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,960
just means that i don't know

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
and that's okay too

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,720
thanks jen um so one of the most common

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,080
barriers for achieving psychological

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
safety that i've experienced throughout

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,199
my career

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,520
is actually managers setting really

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,120
unrealistic expectations

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,879
just simply through their own behavior

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,520
and how they engage with their work

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,960
and how that trickles down to their

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
teams and in fact to everyone in the

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
company

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,280
um i recently worked for a startup where

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
we had um

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,640
folks in charge who were those nice

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
people who really only need like five

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
hours of sleep a day

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
or they at least think they only need

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,159
five hours of sleep a day uh and who

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,719
would be

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,480
online at literally all hours um you

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,440
would be having a random conversation

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
about something that you didn't think

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,040
was particularly important and then all

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
of a sudden someone with a c-level title

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
would

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,839
jump into the conversation and start

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,240
explaining to you why your opinion was

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,000
in fact

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
completely wrong and then you also look

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
at the clock and realize it's 2 am for

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,320
them

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,000
and when you as a manager as a leader

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
set the example that people have to be

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,560
always on and

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,720
always available and also always somehow

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,279
outperforming their very very best

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
self at all times you create an

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,519
environment where people

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
are constantly in fight or flight mode

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,440
right you

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,200
you are never actually able to sit back

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,680
and simply reflect if you feel like

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
somebody who is in authority over you is

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,360
constantly watching you is

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,720
constantly doing things as constantly

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,880
being tasked with with

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
stuff that they need to accomplish and

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,760
how are you ever going to live up to

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
that set of expectations

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,480
you can't and your work suffers and your

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
quality of life suffers as a result

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,959
leading to

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,160
this is so eugen i know it's so me um i

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
was reflecting how so me it is because

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
right now

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
the state of colorado is on fire in a

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,959
way that

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,480
um that is is unfortunate um but

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,399
i think um i think in in

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,240
in the case here and i i was also

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,240
reflecting as uh leslie was speaking

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,680
about my own behavior as a manager

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,360
of a team and how i have actively

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,000
tried at least this this year to stop

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,920
responding to things after hours and i i

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
realize in a global company after hours

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
for somebody else is not after hours for

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
me

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
and so i give myself a pass for you know

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,120
answering an email at 4 pm my time which

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
is

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,120
very very late for my from my co-workers

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,320
in the czech republic

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
um but i think the

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,800
interesting thing about that whole

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,279
situation is this this connection

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,279
of this overwork and the setting unreal

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,640
uh excuse me unrealistic expectations

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,880
for individuals

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,120
really kind of contributes to this kind

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
of this concept of hero culture so if

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
you are always as a manager air dropping

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
into a situation to save the day

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
you are setting the expectation with

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
your team that they should also airdrop

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
into situations where they will be

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,959
perceived as the hero

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,160
and um you know in companies where

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,760
output is more uh recognized as

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
something that is measurable than

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
outcome

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,079
hero culture really thrives and what i

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,399
mean by that is if you

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,200
are if you are the person who is

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
constantly

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,760
first in line to fix whatever bug is on

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,320
fire whatever thing is

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,040
is broken and it is midnight your time

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,240
i have to ask like is this really is

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,000
this really healthy

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,920
um or is it just that you like you

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,040
prefer working at midnight right

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,880
these are these are generally um

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
they're generally things that i i think

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,399
about when i am interacting with folks

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,279
and and mind you even though i work in a

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
forward-facing product division now at

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
red hat

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,760
the majority of my career was back

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
office i t i i was that support person

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,560
that you called when email was down

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,959
um i know what it looks like to fire

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
fight

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,200
because that's frankly the entire first

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
half of my career

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
was being first in line to answer the

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,320
call when somebody wasn't able to use

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,000
their computer

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,120
and there is something it's almost like

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,880
um reflecting back on my own situation

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,760
with this it's almost like there's a

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,160
there's a there's a hit of pleasure when

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,320
you have somebody who calls you and says

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,920
i really need this right now can you

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
please drop everything you're doing or

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
even worse

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,320
that phone call you get at three in the

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,839
morning when a server is down

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
oh my god right like there's this

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
you go into an immediate panic like

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,959
you've got to fix this thing right now

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
because somebody can't do your job and

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
oh my god i'm going to get yelled at if

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,720
it doesn't get resolved

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
um and and honestly in the earlier part

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
of my career there was also a

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,279
i must fix this right now to hide the

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,120
fact that we did not do the right thing

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,880
because if i don't someone's going to

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
get yelled at and potentially fired i

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
mean that was a reality

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,040
of of i.t and for many of you it might

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
still be your reality that still might

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
be the

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
uh environment in which you work in and

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,560
so like this this

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
vicious cycle of i'm going to be really

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
hyper

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,800
anxious and super stressed out i'm going

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
to fix the problem

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
and then the user is going to be like

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
thank you so much and they're going to

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,279
walk away and you're going to feel

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
victorious and it's going to be this

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
thing that you train your brain into

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,639
doing it's kind of like this

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
pick up a phone when you're bored thing

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,680
you're training your brain and you're

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,480
training

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
the culture of your company to do these

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,160
things

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,880
and you know this is not the talk about

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
burnout

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,959
but i will tell you that burnout is

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,760
significantly bad

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,160
and we don't we don't scientifically or

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,639
even

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,160
emotionally understand the long-term

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,800
impact of burnout

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,000
we just don't yet but i can tell you

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,639
having gone through it

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,480
and now on the other side of it after i

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,199
would say maybe what leslie like five

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,680
years of experiencing like a cyclical

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
uh burnout phase in my career and my

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
life

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
it is really hard to unwind yourself

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,720
from

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
so if there is if there is one thing

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
that i could tell y'all to do

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,600
related to psychological safety is

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,040
please do not

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
please do not find yourself in this

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,320
circle if or the cycle if you can

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,000
avoid absolutely so

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,760
jen you know did a really great job

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
explicating how like we build things

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,639
into our culture that can damage

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,560
psychological safety and

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,000
one of the experiences that i've had

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,519
with um particularly with startup

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,839
environments is

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,600
creating uh company cultures that have

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,519
uh norms and

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
social interactions that actually

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
exclude a lot of the people

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
uh in the ad environment from feeling

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
like they can be successful and they can

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
be included right

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
so um once upon a time i worked at a

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,040
startup where there was a weekly

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,480
foosball tournament

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,399
and i mean honestly who does not like

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,720
foosball foosball is fun well

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
um i don't like foosball because i am

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,279
really bad at it and i have poor depth

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
perception

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,880
and um maybe not the best hand-eye

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,120
coordination ever

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,959
you know i like to watch it but you know

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
what that effectively did was

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,040
for the you know two hours a week where

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,639
we were all having social hour and the

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
focus was on like watching people

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,199
interact while they were playing

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
foosball and having a tournament and

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,600
points on the wall like i

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,440
could only be as included as that

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,880
bystander who was sitting there sipping

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
a beer that she didn't actually really

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,480
want to drink because alcohol is not my

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
favorite beverage

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
in order to feel like i was kind of part

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
of the team

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
right and there are any number of ways

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,720
in which we

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,639
we do things that seem like they are

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,279
well-intentioned and good ideas

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,040
that actually are incredibly excluding

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
behaviors like

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,320
serving dinner for your employees at

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
work i mean

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
who doesn't want a delicious dinner i

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,279
know i do but what the message that that

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,160
actually sends

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,880
is if you're not dedicated enough to be

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,759
here

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
working after hours if you have to go

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
home

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
you know to care for your family if you

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,600
have to go home and just put your feet

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
up on the couch and watch netflix

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,360
because you are tired and you need to

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,440
refresh yourself there is something

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
wrong with you you are not actually

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,959
you know in it to win it with the rest

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,959
of us and and

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,079
basically creating these these social

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,240
norms that put pressure

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
on people to always be on to always be

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,440
focused on their work to always be

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
omnipresent

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,079
in their job to the exclusion of all

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
else not only stifles their creativity

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,680
and their ability to feel like they can

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
accomplish good things

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
when they're on the job it also just

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
makes people feel like this isn't the

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,079
right environment for them and you may

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,120
have really high performers who decide

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,800
that they're going to go be high

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
performers somewhere else

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,839
in a corporate culture that values them

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
having work-life balance right which is

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,720
a bummer you don't want to lose

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,480
good people just because they were not

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,680
good at playing foosball

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,279
exactly i mean i wouldn't i i oftentimes

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
uh reflect on the whole

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,279
cultural phenomena that is coming out of

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,079
silicon valley for like

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,240
literally my entire career of putting

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,000
couches in people's offices so they can

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,920
sleep there overnight and i'm huh

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,279
why is that a thing why did anybody

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,920
agree to do that

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,880
anyway no no my dear this is a huge

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
improvement over the

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,799
time when you had a sleeping bag under

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,360
your desk so that you could stay in your

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,079
office over

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,400
this was a thing i did not hear about

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,400
that

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
now i'm even more horrified so i guess

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,839
more later

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:22,240
i guess the couch is an upgrade yes

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,959
all right this is you my dear

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,559
okay cool it's me so how do we go about

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
engendering psychological safety

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,320
in the work environment and i think that

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,679
the the key element here

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,799
is through building trust so let's talk

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,240
a little bit about how we can actually

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,600
build trust

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,559
um you know i

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,120
so the the only thing i can tell you is

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,320
safe

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,760
safety has got to start with trust

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,160
there is no situation there just just to

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,200
be clear there's no tool you can buy

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,240
there's nothing you can install no no

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,400
company has

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
a framework that you can purchase to

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
coach to

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,320
there's nothing out there that that will

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,919
be purchasable for you to actually um

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
have this trust and gendered in your

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,919
organization

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,559
the most important part and the most

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,600
important thing for you to understand

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,400
is that this is hard and messy human

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,039
work

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,520
and that is that is the bottom line and

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,200
so here's the rules

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
and and this is going to be really hard

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,840
so just don't don't feel like

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,799
if you if you fail to do it one day

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,200
you're done and you

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,799
can't try again the next day being

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,240
transparent at work

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,640
um being clear about your needs and

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,360
your own goals when you're talking at

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,440
work

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,960
isn't an easy thing to do but you must

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,360
do it

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,760
you must do it because if you are not

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,679
transparent about what is going on

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
no one will ever feel like they can be

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,520
transparent with you

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,799
that is the bottom line and i have found

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
at red hat

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,559
especially this year especially in times

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,559
of

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,600
weird um social political unrest

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,360
um pandemics

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,960
you know what um there were a lot of

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,200
people on my team who really were

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,280
struggling with their home environments

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,039
and it wasn't until i said something

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
about my own struggles

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,360
that they felt like having their own

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,120
struggles was okay like there is some

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,280
and i'm not the person who sets

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,360
unrealistic expectations i try my best

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,679
to be very reasonable about

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,200
what i am asking from my team and i

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
always say you know you need to push

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
back if i'm asking for too much

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,640
tell me when i'm being unreasonable be

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,400
be transparent with me

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,320
um it's it's the hardest thing we're

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
gonna do it's that's the hardest step

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
forward

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,039
um and don't feel like you have to be

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,559
transparent uh like leslie and i are

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,679
gonna be later in this talk

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,240
um take a baby step be transparent like

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,799
saying

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,640
hey i've got to get my kid to school in

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,080
the morning i'm going to need 15 minutes

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,919
later meetings start

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,200
um that's okay start start with

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,480
something small

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,280
and safe to you and then grow as you

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,200
watch your team

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,200
expand into um the second thing is

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
while you are being overly transparent

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,120
about your needs

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,760
like be strong-willed and and be very

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
clear

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,080
but also understand when somebody else

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,360
has a need that is maybe in conflict

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,880
with yours

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,760
like for example um for me personally

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,320
starting my day at seven in the morning

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
is about

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
where i want to start but because of

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
where i live

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
and because of the people that i work

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,400
with i typically start my day around

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,679
five in the morning um

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,440
so while i understand that

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,120
folks on the east coast of the united

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,600
states would like a meeting at

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,240
you know seven in the morning their time

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,960
um

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,400
because the reality is that red hat once

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,919
once 9am hits

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,840
about uh the the it's like

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,840
it's essentially like a three-hour block

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
of the most busiest time for the entire

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,880
company

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
because of the overlapping um work hours

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
between

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
north america and emea and to a certain

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,200
degree

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,440
you know aipac that understanding

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,559
where we all fall in line there

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
understanding

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,600
the fact that i really don't wanna have

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,039
a five a.m meeting and they need to have

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
a seven a meeting

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,640
and maybe i don't need to be on that

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,280
meeting and so maybe we can figure out

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,039
some compromise that creates a situation

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,320
where we both win

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,559
and then finally um be a real person um

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
i think there is a picture yes there is

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,679
yay

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,520
um picture ever uh you know it is the

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,480
best picture ever it is from my personal

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,919
selfie collection

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
if you would like to be in my personal

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,320
selfie collection look me up once we get

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,360
to go back to

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,880
real conferences um

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,840
if you don't bring your whole self to

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
work um

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,640
you know i just i struggle with this

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,919
concept of not being me at work

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,919
it it it would be so hard for me to to

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,240
shut down my personality it would be so

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,200
hard for me not to be playful to want to

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,039
have fun

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,360
this was something that was truly built

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,760
into my social

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
upbringing um the you know growing up in

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,080
a very loud

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,400
irish uh italian family with with

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,799
card playing on the weekend with jokes

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,679
with all of those stereotypes you you

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,760
know to be true

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,440
you know talking with your hands right

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,280
this is something that if i couldn't

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,720
bring this whole self to work i would be

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,280
lesser of a person

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
and so bringing your bringing your real

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
self to work

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,280
bringing your whole self to work is

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,799
something that that

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,559
will help others um bond with you

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,000
help them understand who you are as a

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,039
person help them understand how to

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,039
compromise with you

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,559
so um i think that all of this like

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,080
bringing your whole self to work i think

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,679
the way that i ground it in my mind is

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,720
to think about it in terms of like

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,159
vulnerability

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
so uh first and foremost we've been

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,799
talking about a lot of heavy stuff so

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,840
let us all admire this beautiful cat

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
picture for a moment

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,720
so i i look at um vulnerability is

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,880
actually a primary leadership skill

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,880
right if i cannot

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,799
admit when i am wrong if i cannot admit

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,600
when i do not know the answer

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,159
if i cannot be completely and totally

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
honest

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,760
about having made a mistake in the

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,440
repercussions of that mistake and also

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
self-aware and reflective to let people

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
know what i have learned from that

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,440
situation and what i intend to do better

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
the next time

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
i'm not going to be able to be an

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,320
effective teammate or an effective

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
manager or an effective leader

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
because you know people are going to

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,679
look at me and think oh all this person

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,120
wants to do is place blame

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,480
this person doesn't understand how they

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,679
contributed to the situation being

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
difficult

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
this person isn't willing to admit how

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,880
they are flawed this person isn't

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,559
willing to show up and be a real person

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,400
right um i think my favorite ever

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,640
um discussion of leaning through

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
vulnerability was actually um carl fogle

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,120
who is super

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
famous fancy pants for having written

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,000
the book on um open source software

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
it is called producing open source

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,240
software and you should totally read it

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
um

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,000
talked one time um about how he

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,440
as part of the process of encouraging

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
new contributors to the subversion

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,520
project

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,760
how he would um instead of going over

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
his responses to email 15 times which he

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,320
would normally do because he was a super

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,320
meticulous person

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,520
he would you know check it once or twice

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,919
and then just let it go

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
knowing that there would be errors in it

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,200
so that new people to the project

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,760
could see those errors and say hey

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,520
oh wonderful super important fancy pants

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,279
person did you notice this error over

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,720
here maybe we want to fix the error and

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,760
he could say oh yes absolutely we should

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,520
fix that

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
because that vulnerability created

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,080
psychological safety for the people he

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,159
was working with people

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,679
understood that he too was a human being

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,159
he too could make mistakes

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,400
and that perfection was not the expected

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,559
standard for participation right

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
so by experiencing your own

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,760
vulnerability and not expecting

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,440
perfection from yourself you leave space

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,080
for other people to just

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,520
be themselves to make mistakes but to do

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,440
better because of those mistakes they

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,120
made i mean none of us were like

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
born full sprung from the head of zeus

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,000
being amazing and perfect

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,440
and if you were we would like to talk to

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
you about participating in our next talk

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,600
thank you very much

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
yeah you know the other thing i was

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,039
thinking in the space too and it

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,880
as you were talking i was like oh my god

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,240
this is exactly what i tell teams when

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
they're building things

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,120
to to not gold-plate them because the

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
more the more gold you put on things

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,640
the more emotionally committed you are

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,640
to the way that you built it

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,039
and if you bring this gold-plated

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,880
perfect you know crown of code

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,400
into a situation and and somebody looks

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,520
at it and says i don't think you did

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
that the right way

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,520
if you have literally poured your heart

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,640
and soul into this

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,320
what do you think your emotional

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,200
response to somebody rejecting it's

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,679
gonna be

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,840
of course it's gonna be negative so

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,720
draft code

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,720
um maybe partially built things

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,919
those are all really good things to to

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,640
do

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,320
that's a really fantastic story leslie

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,559
thank you

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,559
so um we've talked a lot about like how

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,400
psychological safety is important

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,400
and different ways that it can be

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,919
blocked or why it's important to achieve

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,600
it but i think it's also important to

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,240
just ground our conversation a little

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
bit as well

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
and the importance of it for the

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,799
business um because

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,799
you know obviously we all work for

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,159
companies we all want to get paid

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,840
so um one of the interesting things that

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,760
psychological safety brings to the table

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,919
is the ability for organizations to

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
build out more diverse teams right if we

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,559
are

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,400
all um in lockstep with one another we

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
all look the same act the same

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,200
think the same we don't have to worry

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,480
about psychological safety because no

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,679
one is different

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,520
and therefore we produce what could very

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,240
well be described as probably mediocre

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,240
results right

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,840
if we do not have a plethora of

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,279
perspectives and voices informing the

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,120
decisions that we make we're not going

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,039
to make products that are

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,720
um you know that much better for the

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,400
entire marketplace we're not going to be

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,760
able to have better ideas we're not

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
actually going to be able to be creative

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
and innovative we're just going to do

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,600
exactly what we've always done the

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,080
entire time

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,120
and that sounds great in practice like

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,799
in theory but

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,400
according to mckinsey because we backed

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,640
up the slide for just one second

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,520
sorry oh yeah that's awesome like that

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
um

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,799
companies that have a more diverse

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
workforce have financial returns well

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,120
above their industry mean

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,279
and that's to the tune of like 35

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,000
so there's an actual bottom line impact

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
making sure that you have a

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,039
psychologically safe work environment

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,640
and then we move on uh so

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,240
i think that you know we talk about we

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,440
talk about diversity we talk about

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,799
you know wanting to make sure that we

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
have a plethora of perspectives and

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,760
voices but

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
it's not enough to just say we want to

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,320
create a work environment that is

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,320
diverse

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,080
it is great to have a diverse work

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,679
environment but what we actually need is

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,200
an inclusive work environment we don't

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,559
just want to have

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
a whole bunch of different people who

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
come to work every day we want to have a

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,880
whole bunch of different people who come

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
to work every day and feel like their

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
their contributions are valued that

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
their voice matters

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,720
and that they they we want them to

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,240
express their differences of opinion

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,520
their own perspectives their own unique

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,640
voice right so

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,360
diversity and psychological safety

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,440
together

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,039
create an environment of inclusion right

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
and if we do not create inclusive work

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,559
environments

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
all of our work to create this diverse

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,679
perspective just means that we get

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,279
people in the door and then they have no

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,520
motivation to stay

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,039
and the business loses out on all of the

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,799
time energy and effort

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,799
brought it you know to recruiting these

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,559
people training them getting them

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,960
prepared to actually be successful and

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,320
then

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,960
if they don't feel like they can succeed

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,559
they just leave

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,960
seems like a bad outcome not what i want

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,679
all right so so we've we've talked a lot

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,520
about um

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,039
you know psychological safety and all of

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,480
that and i i think that um one of the

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,440
reasons that i love jen so much is she

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,960
and i are both big

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,559
believers in practicing what we preach

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,880
and not just standing here and saying

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,600
you should do things um but we actually

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,840
do those things

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,039
ourselves so we are going to talk a

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,559
little bit about what psychological

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,600
safety means to the two of us

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,600
and it's actually very different

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,919
so what psychological safety means for

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,360
me so we're going to do a really quick

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,720
retreat into story time so about four

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,640
and a half years ago

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,320
i had the greatest thing ever in my

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,919
whole life happened to me um i had my

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,720
little daughter katarina

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,679
and that was an amazing experience but

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,760
it came along

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,720
with um undiagnosed postpartum

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,480
depression like

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,919
severely uh severe undiagnosed

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,960
postpartum depression

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,919
um and i didn't really know that it was

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,520
happening to me um i didn't really know

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,360
that i had postpartum depression until

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,399
of all things i heard it described on a

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,320
situation comedy tv show which was

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,440
pretty weird i'm like oh i have that

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,799
thing perhaps i should

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,520
seek medical attention um so the result

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,159
of of this was to seek medical attention

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,039
for

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,640
my clearly failing mental health and the

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,240
upshot of that was i ended up taking

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,360
medical leave for seven months to get

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,799
treatment

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,840
which was really good and important but

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:51,279
it was really hard for me to do that

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,039
because i think workaholic once upon a

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,520
time is a nice way to put it

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,960
i definitely did a lot of defining of

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,240
myself through my career

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,679
and my work achievements

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,399
and i also just felt like

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,200
walking away from my job meant some kind

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,039
of failure

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,039
of myself as a person like i was letting

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,080
my team down like i was i was really

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,080
humiliated

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,240
about needing to say like i need to step

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,640
away i need to take care of myself

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,640
um and it's important that i did and i

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,559
came back to work i think

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,919
five months earlier than like was

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,320
expected like also

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,679
seriously kudos and shout out to red hat

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,120
for their amazing

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,559
handling of that situation i'm super

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,279
grateful to work at this company um i

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,440
cannot

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,640
i could not have asked for for better

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,600
support

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,399
um you know so i came back to work and i

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,440
was really

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,120
sheepish and i don't know how to put it

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,559
the right way maybe like closed off

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,000
at first because i i just kind of felt

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,640
like everyone was judging me and felt

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,399
like i was a big screw-up and

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,720
you know just all of that like mental

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,640
emotional baggage that you bring along

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,120
to the party um and uh you know i was

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,559
i so then i ended up at an event when i

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,919
was chatting with one of my co-workers

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,640
and you know he said yeah

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,600
we're glad to have you back and i said

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,279
yeah

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,679
okay sure and he said no no no no leslie

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,559
we have been waiting for you to come

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,440
back

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,440
we have missed you so much we have

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,360
missed what you bring to our team

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,000
we have missed what you bring to our

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,640
group we are so grateful

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
that we have you with us and i remember

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,480
in that moment

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,039
that all of that fear and all of that

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,720
just

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,000
terror that somehow i was not good

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,039
enough and that i had made a huge

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
mistake and that

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,600
how dare i be human was just lifted and

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
after that i wasn't afraid anymore i

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,519
wasn't ever afraid to

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,240
to say like today i am having a bad

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
brain day

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,039
maybe today will not be my best day i'm

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,320
still going to show up and i'm still

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,760
going to be here for you but if you want

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
my best output you might want to talk to

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
me tomorrow morning after i've had my

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,919
first cup of coffee

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,080
and that that really made all the

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
difference in the world for me

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,200
it's a really special story i i shout

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,279
out to rich bowen for being awesome yeah

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,120
i mean seriously i cannot thank you

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,960
enough rich for

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,840
for doing that for leslie because i

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,279
think if i recall i might have said very

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,440
similar things to you

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,279
leslie but yes you needed somebody

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,880
other than me to say those same things

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,440
to you like somebody who

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,799
you it's not that you respect you don't

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,240
it's not that you don't respect me it's

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,080
that you need

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,960
needed a colleague like a a true peer to

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,159
say that to you

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,120
in a way that um in the way that you can

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,440
hear it and i

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,960
i cannot i mean it's so funny that i'm

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,200
thinking rich not directly but

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,720
i cannot thank him enough for for coming

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,679
to work with his true self too

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,240
because that took a lot of compassion um

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,240
and

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,159
a lot of i mean like he could have also

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,399
been outside of his comfort zone sharing

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,159
that with you because

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,840
you might have responded very negatively

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,080
to it i mean who knows right

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
right so kudos for him for being

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,720
courageous

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,559
um so on my side

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,159
it was interesting i was telling the

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,080
story to leslie and when i told the

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,480
story to her she said are you sure you

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,480
want to

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,519
and i said well why not and then i

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,960
realized exactly what she was asking me

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,960
and maybe she didn't know that she was

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,760
asking me that um but

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,120
so i grew up with a mother who has

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,360
schizophrenia

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,200
and we did not know at the time when i

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,840
was a child that that's what

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,960
um she had it was a an undiagnosed

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,919
mental illness um

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,559
we really weren't sure and it kind of

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,919
shaped

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,320
uh it kind of it shaped my childhood

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
and the way that i am as an adult in a

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,760
way that

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,799
i'm still learning what what it means

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,120
like in fact i

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,480
literally had an epiphany while telling

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,039
the story to her

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,000
um what amounts to like what was it like

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,799
20 minutes ago

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,640
right and i think i think the bottom

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,200
line here is is that

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,200
um my mother spent her entire life

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,159
trying to hide this from others

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,760
and so what she did which which for

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,960
those of you who understand anything

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,880
about schizophrenia

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,919
will understand um my mom my mom doesn't

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,720
regularly uh par you know hear voices or

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,560
regularly

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,560
um uh see things uh as part of her

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,200
schizophrenia what she does is she

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,520
retells stories and so for example

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,800
she might go out of her house and have

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,280
an interaction with the next door

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,599
neighbor

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,760
which could be as innocuous as hello

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,040
good morning maureen how are you doing

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,960
um and she'll tell this story over and

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,839
over and over as the course of the day

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,079
goes on

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,119
and her brain will inject things into

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,520
the story

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,520
that frankly didn't happen and so it

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,000
will go from

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,399
hi hello how are you doing today to all

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,320
of a sudden the neighbor

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,159
had an altercation with me on my front

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,919
porch and now i'm not safe

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,880
and so she she is um she wraps

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,160
this falsehood around a sense of being

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,720
fearful of others

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,960
and that really shaped my childhood it

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,280
shaped it in a way that i think

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,079
um without my father involved in this

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,760
situation

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,079
it may not have occurred and so my

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,440
father on the other side

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,400
was always a truth teller he was um

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
plain about about his his thoughts he

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
was very

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,800
clear with with us as children about his

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,960
expectations of what he wanted for us

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,800
and so that juxtaposition of a of a

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,800
parent who could never tell the truth

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,480
um or she was telling her truth is

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,400
probably a better way of putting it

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,400
and the other parent who always saw the

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,960
truth for what it really was

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
and made us tell that truth really

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,079
shaped who i am

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,839
as a person today and so psychological

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,040
safety for me at work

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,040
means i get to tell the truth um without

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,560
fear regardless of the consequences

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,440
and it is it is a trait

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,760
which i will tell you has a time ticker

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,040
on it especially at organizations

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,280
because eventually

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,760
you will tell the truth in a situation

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,599
in which the consequences are severe

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,000
and i will tell you in my career i have

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,920
been in that situation more than once

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,200
and i've always managed to tell the

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,839
truth in a way that

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,240
has has made it possible for me to be

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,760
successful in my career but eventually

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
eventually i will tell the truth in the

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,800
wrong way at the wrong time

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,000
and it will have severe impact but

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,440
for me i will always continue to do that

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,440
because i i i see the damage that my

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,280
mother did to me growing up i see the

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,200
damage that she did to my siblings

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,119
i see the damage she did to our family

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
unit and the fact that i don't have

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,960
interactions with my cousins my extended

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,760
family all that stuff i see the damage

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
it did

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,760
and i as a result has made me

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,599
uh impatient with people who don't tell

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,040
the truth it has made me impatient for

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,920
folks who try to

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,040
manipulate or go around or or try to

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,560
change the situation for their benefit

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,400
and i will also tell you that as a

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,440
communications expert as somebody who

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,920
spends

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,119
their entire job observing people and

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,640
their behavior

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,240
i know when people are not telling the

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,720
truth and so

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,599
if i could if i could even say the

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,760
negative

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,800
what makes me psychologically unsafe at

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
work is when i know

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,320
people are not telling me the truth and

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,320
i and i see it all the time

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,400
so it's something that i feel very

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,400
strongly about

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,599
making sure that others know the truth

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,040
and making sure that

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,720
that that truth is as true as it can be

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,760
and not necessarily just my own

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,920
perception

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,440
and so the other thing that is important

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
about telling the truth

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
is understanding when you are wrong as

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,640
well

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,079
um and we're going to talk a little bit

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,440
about that in

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,359
in at the very end of this talk yeah

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,560
um so one important nuance about this is

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,560
that we have just told you what

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
psychological safety means for both of

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,079
us

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,240
and you will notice that they are

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,280
completely different um

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,680
uh there there is uh there is truth in

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
that

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,000
and i think i mentioned earlier that it

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,880
is really important for

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,800
you know we didn't start with the

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,720
definition of psychological safety for

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,200
one very important reason which is it is

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,839
not the same for every single person

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,560
and so if you if you do not nothing else

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,200
start with

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,079
writing down what it means to you and it

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
might be something

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,920
so unattainable and and you might feel

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,720
like oh gosh how am i ever gonna get

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
there

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,240
um i i'm here to tell you that just

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,359
simply writing it down

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,200
is gonna make it true eventually

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,359
not writing it down will mean that you

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,359
will never strive towards that goal

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,880
and you might not even really remember

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,160
it in situations where it's most

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,040
important to you

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,040
so write one down

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,000
and since we both love actionable

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,680
feedback we want to take you

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,240
through a few things that you can do

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,680
right now to help achieve psychological

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,480
safety for yourself and for others in

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,200
the workplace

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,000
um so start off with compassion for

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,040
yourself

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
right and it is i i cannot count the

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
number of people in my

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,839
life for whom we are our own worst

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,520
critics and we will judge ourselves far

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,560
more harshly than anyone

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,560
else ever will um but you know remember

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,920
when you're having that terrible day

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,320
and or maybe it's a terrible week

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,599
sometimes that happens too and you can't

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,880
get everything done that you want to get

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,160
done and you feel like your work is

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,839
suffering and you feel like people's

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,200
opinion of you is suffering and you feel

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,720
like there is no way that you are ever

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,920
going to dig yourself out of this hole

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,720
of not awesome that you find yourself in

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,680
it's okay to not be perfect all of the

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,280
time in fact

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,960
if you think that you are being perfect

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,880
all the time you are having a completely

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,560
different problem which is delusion

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,760
and that can possibly be the subject of

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,040
another presentation that judd and i

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,599
will not be giving

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,040
um so remember be kind be kind to

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,400
yourself right everyone

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,839
we should always be kind because

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,800
everyone is fighting a hard battle and

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,240
that starts with us

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,160
if we can't have compassion for

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,000
ourselves it's very difficult for us to

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,400
have compassion for anyone else

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,720
so start with yourself and then after

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,200
that remember compassion for others

00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,760
i think that if uh if anything our

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,520
current

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,040
tumultuous circumstances in the world

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,720
have really helped us to have that

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,599
compassion for other people because we

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,800
suddenly

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,319
have gotten a very intimate view of the

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,560
pressures and the

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,200
the um uh i want to say periphery our

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
real lives

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,079
outside of work are not our periphery

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,760
but what what goes on in people's

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,040
everyday life that we never experience

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,560
or know about because we've been very

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,960
careful to craft this vernier of

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,319
professionalism that never touches on

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,160
what happens in our home life and then

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,160
suddenly you know it's like wow

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,480
it's probably really hard to have five

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,520
kids you know not in the middle of a

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
pandemic

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,200
bouncing around your house making lots

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,960
of noises like suddenly we get a real

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,560
opportunity to understand

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,240
what each one of us experiences in their

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,640
daily life for good or for ill right and

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,920
having compassion for those moments of

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,520
well this was not your most shining

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,359
moment and that's okay because tomorrow

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,400
i will have my not the shining moment

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,400
right and since we know that we are

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,480
going to make mistakes

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,680
frequently because we are all fallible

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,240
human beings

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,599
right it's okay to make mistakes just

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,400
try and make new and better mistakes

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,960
every day

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
right new and better mistakes is a

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,599
perfectly

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,599
awesome outcome

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,520
okay so last but not least

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,640
i know this is super important cultivate

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,599
your friend network

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,960
right like so so jen and i actually um

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,000
we put this in at the last minute and we

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,520
had a debate about whether or not it was

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
too cheesy but i i think it's actually

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,760
really important to talk about it like

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,119
when you are you know when you are in

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,640
your work environment you need people

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,079
that you can just be a real person with

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,760
like completely and utterly

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,359
unconstrained by any concerns of

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
professionalism am i gonna am i gonna

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,560
lose my job is somebody going to decide

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,839
that i you know flip the bozo bit on me

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,040
and decide that they don't want to talk

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,640
to me ever again

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,640
right i cannot count the number of times

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,000
when i was working on an extremely

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,359
difficult project in the last two years

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,480
that jen was intimately familiar with

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,760
where i would call her up and i would go

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,319
okay

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,839
everyone thinks i'm dumb and no one

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,359
wants to listen to me and i am a

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,319
complete failure

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,319
and she would say okay so no one is

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,960
listening to you that is true and here

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,720
is why

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,560
and you are not a complete failure and

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,520
everything is fine and if i hadn't had

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,520
that i don't even

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,640
let's just say negative outcomes right

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,079
because i have because i have the

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,599
support of a friend network at red hat

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,280
i'm able to be that much more successful

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,800
and it is so important so you know

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,960
actually make buddies with people

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,720
you work with and not just like oh maybe

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,720
we'll go get a beer together and like

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,560
talk about sports like actual real

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,520
friendships right you can have real

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,400
friendships at work

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,079
find them cultivate them important to

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,160
your success as a human being

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,200
yeah and and your mental health and

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,200
well-being and

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,920
in my case i um my my favorite

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,520
my favorite situation for me has always

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,240
been

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,880
needing feedback but also needing to

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,280
have it

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,400
be done in a way that is safe because

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,359
you might correlate

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,359
this concept with um a situation as a

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,440
child and what it might be like to have

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,079
a parent who is

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,480
seriously unwell mentally right like you

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,319
can

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,599
you have to just imagine your worst

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,040
nightmare and you

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,880
you can be rest assured that that is

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,000
exactly what happened to me as a child

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,400
um it is it is pretty true that this has

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,359
long and lasting uh impact on on

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,480
individuals

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,280
and part of that is that um i know that

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,560
i'm not

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,280
perfect um surprise i mean i i need

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,160
to to know that i am not perfect and

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,040
your most important

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,079
part i know right thanks i don't believe

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,119
you for a second

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,359
um the the interesting situation for me

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,359
is that i also need psychological safety

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,839
when i am learning about where i have my

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,160
might have failed and for me that comes

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,720
in the form of a deer mentor who i've

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,760
been working with for the past two years

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,800
who does work at red hat and does

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,440
have the grace and also the skill to

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,680
tell me when i might have misstep

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,800
in a way that i can hear it but i will

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,640
tell you something

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,640
i would not have been able for her to do

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,000
this with me if we did not have a

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,040
friendship first

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
that came first and

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,640
it's something i treasure like i i need

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,240
the real honest feedback about how i am

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,680
approaching things and what i could do

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,839
differently

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,280
but it would not be very easy for me to

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,119
hear it if i did not have that

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,040
established relationship with her and so

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,079
for me to grow as an individual

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,000
um both personally and professionally

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,319
um it is important for me to rely on

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,560
somebody that i personally trust

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,440
to hear the things that i need to hear

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
um so

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,520
i can't i mean it's it's the good part

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,040
is you've got the support the friend

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,520
base the people that are

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,720
are always lifting you up but it's also

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,160
important because these are the people

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,319
who are going to tell you the truth

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
about what it is that you are doing and

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,680
how it might have

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,119
impacted somebody else negatively and so

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,720
that is um

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,319
you know positive positive of the

00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,920
situation to have that type of network

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,839
