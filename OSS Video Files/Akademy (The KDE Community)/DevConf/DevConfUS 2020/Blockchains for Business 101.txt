Title: Blockchains for Business 101
Publication date: 2020-10-07
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Gordon Haff

Blockchain has passed the height of its hype. But it’s relatively quietly made its way into important enterprise use cases. In this talk, Red Hat’s Gordon Haff will provide an overview of the open source blockchain technologies that have emerged as the market leaders. He’ll also examine the areas of the market in which enterprise blockchains have gained the greatest early traction and explain why that’s the case.

This knowledge will provide attendees with the basics they need to become involved with blockchain projects and to understand where blockchain might be applicable to their organization’s business needs.

okay folks it's uh

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,840
3 30 p.m est and uh

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,480
we are about to start our

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,719
next session so next step will be

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,400
blockchains for business 101

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,880
with gordon huff and

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
the session will run as a recorded

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,880
session

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
i'll share it you have a link in the

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
chat window in case any technical

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
difficulties watching it here

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,160
and we'll have gordon to answer

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
questions

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,680
after the presentation on in this

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,040
channel

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
let's let me try to share it

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,480
hi i'm gordon half technology evangelist

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
with red hat

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,199
in this presentation i'm going to take

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,840
you through what enterprise blockchain

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,440
is or distributed ledger technology if

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
you prefer

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,559
some of the reasons that you might be

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,840
interested in using it

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,559
some of the conditions that may mean it

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,760
really is

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,880
not the right technology for you

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,880
some of the areas in which blockchain

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,920
is being used and then finally

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,400
what is red hat doing with blockchain

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
thank you

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,640
let's start by talking about what a

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,000
blockchain

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,600
is for our purposes here uh we're

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,320
not talking uh icos we're not

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,439
talking bitcoin or other types of

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,439
currencies

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
rather we're talking about enterprise

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,840
blockchain

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,360
and what that is is a shared permission

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,759
distributed ledger technology visible to

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,159
and the transactions validated by

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,600
members of a business blockchain

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,000
network using a consensus protocol

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,560
now that was a whole lot of words there

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,759
so let me break that down a little bit

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,399
first of all distributed ledger

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,040
is shared by those members of the

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,239
blockchain network

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,920
those members are permissioned this is

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,480
not a public blockchain uh you have

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,560
business entities of some sort who have

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,720
some sort of trust relationship

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
doesn't mean they trust each other 100

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,599
but they have some sort of trust

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,560
relationship and they are participating

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
together

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,319
using a consensus protocol and

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
again what consensus protocol means you

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,720
probably have heard a lot about that

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
in the context of bitcoin where

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,120
something called proof of work

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,959
is consensus protocol and it's very

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,760
energy intensive

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,040
because it involves essentially mine

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,720
doing cryptographic

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,760
mining in the case of

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
permissioned blockchains other types of

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,280
consensus mechanisms

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,040
that don't require that they do require

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,760
a certain degree of trust

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
among the participants can be used

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
instead

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
uh and basically the it doesn't need to

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
be

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,239
all the members of the network but you

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,159
basically have voting nodes that decide

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,920
whether a transaction is valid or not

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,959
there's no central repository this is a

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,760
distributed structure

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,560
and there's usually no central authority

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,519
although

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
that is not an absolute requirement you

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,200
can have central authorities

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,560
for example a company might use a

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
blockchain

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
in conjunction with uh its suppliers for

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,879
example

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
in that case it still is a distributed

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
ledger

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
but you do essentially of one central

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,879
authority who is deciding who can

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
participate and deciding what the rules

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,360
around that blockchain are uh and then

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,080
one additional element

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
and you see this on the top layer of the

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,599
diagram

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
there um is that you have these things

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,799
called smart

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,519
contracts that can be used to take

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,239
actions

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
based on predefined events so for

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
example

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,239
if you if a transaction completes if you

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,479
receive a shipped good

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,600
if you um send money to someone

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,960
actions can be automatically taken in

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
with respect to uh that transaction

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,040
being completed so

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,080
a good is delivered a payment is taken

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,240
in response to that good being delivered

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,400
just to very briefly go through what the

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,639
architecture of a blockchain looks like

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,840
i already mentioned the smart contract

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
saying they're up on top but you have a

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
series of

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
blocks uh and that what all a block is

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
is

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720
a collection of transactions and you'll

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,040
see some other features

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
um in those blocks there's some kind of

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
merkle root

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
all that means is you have a

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,199
cryptographic

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,280
hash of the transactions that went that

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,560
are going into the block

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,440
um and then you have um and then you

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
have a hash

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,039
of the previous block header and the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
reason that this

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,720
is interesting is that's what forms your

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
chain

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
of blocks so if you go back in time and

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
say

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,440
alter the contents of one of those

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,919
blocks then it's obvious because

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,800
because those changes percolate down the

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,320
chain and it's

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,880
obvious that there has been some

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,880
alteration has happened

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,120
uh in those previous blocks and that has

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
various types of implications which i'll

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
get to and really the interesting part i

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,360
think of the technology

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
isn't necessarily so much the technology

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
itself

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
but rather the characteristics that the

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,199
technology

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
uh create with result with respect to

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,560
how blockchains can be used

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
and essentially a blockchain lets you

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,080
build

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,800
a decentralized business network and

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,120
actually many

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,440
elements of that network are very

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
familiar to things that we have today

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,759
so you have a network of some sort

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
connecting different businesses who are

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
partnering

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,720
in various respects for purchasing goods

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,919
delivering goods

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,919
paying for things and so forth

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
all of those participants have an

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,080
identity

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,400
and um in the case of business uh

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
networks those are typically a known

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,280
identity

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
although they could be pseudonymous in

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,680
various ways

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
uh assets of various types flow over

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,319
those business networks

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:47,120
uh money being digital uh currency um

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,360
fiat currency typically uh can be one of

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
those uh one of those types of assets

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,199
but also the digital representation of

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,560
goods uh information about

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,000
uh the network participants and so forth

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,880
um transactions just as in today

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
they describe some sort of asset

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
exchange

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,680
so um you know loans for cash

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,400
uh cash for goods that kind of thing

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,039
you have some sort of legal frameworks

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,319
underpinning those transactions so if

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,720
i deliver this to you uh on

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,599
such and such a schedule you're going to

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,919
pay me

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
this amount of money and then you have a

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,160
ledger to log the transactions and

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,520
that's the actual blockchain

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,759
that we are talking about here

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,919
um i'll give you one example to make

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,000
this maybe a little more concrete and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,960
i'm using uh

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,639
hyperledger as the example here

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,240
um this is a foundation underneath the

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,680
linux foundation

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,639
uh which contains a number of important

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,319
blockchain

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,319
uh projects um you actually you have the

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,199
actual distributed ledgers

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,039
uh hyperledger fabric uh which i'll talk

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,759
about a little more in a bit

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,879
um is one of the more popular

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,919
blockchains

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,879
distributed ledgers for enterprise use

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,759
out there

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
uh and other project which i'll

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
highlight up there

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
is uh hyperledger indie and that's

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,960
primarily

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,000
focused on uh distributed identities and

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
there have been some very

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
interesting projects that have been done

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,880
with indy for example

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,200
uh in bris columbia and canada has set

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
up

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
essentially things they call org book

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,320
and

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,839
essentially it's a it's a canonical

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,040
source of information

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,839
about companies um then one of the

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
things that

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
hyperledger specifically has been doing

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,000
around blockchains to

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,760
law focus on making things modular

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,880
and reusable so for example hyperledger

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,680
ursa

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
is a set of cryptographic libraries that

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,080
can be used by

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,000
different uh distributed ledgers and

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
particularly in the crypto space one of

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
the reasons that's nice

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,279
is uh cryptography has a couple of

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
important characteristics in the context

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
of blockchain it's

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,880
a it's very important and b

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,560
is very important to get right so if you

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,000
have a bunch of different

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,800
cryptographic uh implementations out

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,040
there

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
there's a lot more opportunity for

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,839
things to go

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,399
wrong as opposed to having one shared

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,640
library that

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,640
can be used by a bunch of different

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
projects and can be vetted by

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,120
a bunch of different projects and you've

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,760
got various other shared libraries

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
there as well

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
now this is what i think is going to be

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
the actually the interesting part of

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
this presentation i just

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
sort of wanted to set things up for you

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,640
a little bit

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,120
but i think where it gets interesting is

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,519
what can you use distributed ledgers for

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
and

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,279
conversely what might you not want to

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,320
use them for

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,440
so and the way to think about where you

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
might want to

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
use distributed ledgers is to think

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,800
about some of the characteristics

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,480
and one of those characteristics is

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,839
distributed trust

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,360
no single entity controls the storage

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,560
and validation

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,519
of transactions and if we kind of think

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,720
about

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,600
how business is often conducted today

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
there's a lot of

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,519
checks and balances that go

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,440
into establishing different types of

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
trust

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,680
relationships between entities and

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,440
one of the interesting things that

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,200
blockchain does

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,560
is it's a way to uh essentially

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,720
uh trust but verify in a way in a

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,760
business blockchain network so the

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
the sort of the cryptographic setup of

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
the whole thing

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,600
is one way to uh

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,839
not absolutely guarantees i i think

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,399
there is a mistake

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
that sometimes made in thinking about

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,800
blockchain

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,440
is that oh blockchain eliminates the

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
need

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
to have any sort of trust relationships

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,560
blockchain does everything

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,640
and even in a permissioned blockchain

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,959
like this i would argue

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,720
that's not completely true they're still

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,920
kind of ideal you need

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
the rule of law you need to uh enforce

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,760
contracts at some level even if they're

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
smart contracts

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,680
need a legal system in the event of

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,360
disputes in the case of maybe bugs or

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,639
mistakes

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,519
but it certainly does provide a way

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
for entities with at least some level of

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,680
trust

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,040
in each other to cooperate in a lower

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,040
friction sort of way

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,120
a second characteristic which is

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
interesting and

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
is also interesting because it's

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,200
something of a double egg

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,360
sword is the idea of immutability

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,639
uh as i went through with the way that

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,680
the blocks are

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,279
chained together using cryptography

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,079
um you can't just yank out

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,880
a previous block and if you change it in

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,959
some way

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
it's going to be obvious that it has

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,399
been

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,560
changed that actually has implications

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,760
though for how you use blockchain

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,560
because

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,360
uh that's different from a traditional

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,639
database

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,360
where a controlling entity can make

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,920
changes

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,639
to records and sometimes you want to

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,000
make changes to records you want to

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,120
um say expunge transactions after a

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,600
certain length of time uh

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,440
say past retention legal retention

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
requirements or whatnot and you

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
you can't do that in blockchain and

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
there's actually been some discussion

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,720
that

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,880
has gone on around things like gdpr

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,399
and whether that's a problem for

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,000
blockchain in some

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,200
circumstances or not and one of the

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,040
sort of architectural implications of

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,000
this is you give this idea that there is

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,279
some information

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,680
that is on the chain and it connects to

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
other

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,480
information that is off chain and that

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,519
information is off chain

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,800
can be deleted and changed and so forth

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,040
so the the thinking

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
is that when you architect your

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,000
application

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,560
there may be some information you

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,120
actually do keep on the blockchain

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
and then other information that is

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,079
essentially

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,279
not immutable uh and is incorporated

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,839
essentially by

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,839
reference

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,040
i think this is maybe one of the big

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,480
ones with blockchain

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,199
and i'll kind of tell you why in a

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,240
moment is that you have this idea of

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,079
parties securely interacting and there's

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,440
a single source of truth

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,279
they can all agree to um and another way

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,079
to think about is there is a common

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,560
message bust for recorded actions

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,440
that connects entities in a standardized

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,680
way

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,519
and one of the questions early on around

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,040
blockchain particularly in an enterprise

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,680
context was

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,079
well if these parties kind of trust each

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,320
other

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,399
and maybe there's a governmental entity

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,519
that sort of oversees this all

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,839
anyway why can't you just use

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,240
database you know have parties

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,920
communicate like they do today

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,600
and what it turns out is that

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,959
in real in real life uh everyone's

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
a lot of people are using different

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:58,320
systems there's reconciliation needed

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,880
uh and so forth so even if there are

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,480
essentially trustworthy systems that

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,440
exist today

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,279
um it actually turns out to be a lot

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,399
harder to reconcile

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,959
everything than you might

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,000
think it needed to be until you dive

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,560
down into the details i mean the u.s

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,600
we often don't get tax you know our tax

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,000
records from our finance companies until

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
maybe the end of february or something

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
like that and one of the reasons for

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,040
that

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,480
is the need to reconcile

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,360
a lot of um disparate

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,800
systems that weren't originally designed

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
to communicate with each other

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,040
um but why not blockchain um

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,440
you know i've told you all the reasons

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,440
it's really kind of cool and wonderful

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
and you should use it for everything but

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,839
why why might you not

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,839
and yeah

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
answers sometimes conventional databases

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,759
are

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,519
are just fine um you you have a single

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,600
entity in control

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,160
and uh all their you know all their

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,959
suppliers have processes that they need

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,759
to follow

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,440
in order to interact with the

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,560
motherships uh

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,399
database and records and that may be a

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,680
perfectly good way

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,800
of of doing things and i've

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,279
just talked about immutability i mean

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,759
there are some advantages to having

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,800
a mutable database that you control and

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,279
you don't need to worry about this

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,320
immutability feature of blockchain

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,560
um a company wants to have this really

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,199
centralized control now i'll talk about

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,720
this in a

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,759
little more in a second and also uh

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,720
performance definitely continues to be

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,639
uh an issue with with blockchain it's

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
something a lot of work's being done on

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,360
but

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,519
certainly if you have very high

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,959
throughput high data type of

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,280
transactions

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,959
uh and maybe those other characteristics

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,600
of blockchain are

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,439
maybe nice to haves but they're not

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,120
necessarily

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,199
critical maybe a database is better for

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,839
those types of high transaction

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,000
uh applications um

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,000
the participating entities are all part

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,200
of the same trust domain

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
uh you know i guess a good example of

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,799
this

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,520
might be within a particular company or

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,640
within a very closely linked set of

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,960
organizations in the public sector where

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,120
pretty much there's a there's a con sort

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,760
of a common level of trust a common

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
level of

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
access so you don't really need this

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,039
sort of distributed

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,640
trust kind of relationships and

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,200
uh because again it's

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
not an absolute rule but you can think

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
about distributed trust in these

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,760
business networks

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,320
and there is some

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
level of trust for them to have been let

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,280
into the business network

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,840
in the first place but there in many

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,039
cases

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,799
competing entities so uh

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,400
so they're definitely not in the same

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,600
trust domain i mean they all have

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,280
secrets and

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,440
yeah we could probably argue that within

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,919
a given company you have

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,160
organizations they have some secrets of

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,760
their own but is is obviously

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,160
a very qualitative difference from

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,200
a bunch of external separately

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,640
incorporated

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,960
parties who are who are cooperating uh

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,160
for business reasons

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,960
uh assets that can't be reliably

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,840
digitized um and this kind

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,000
i think we can worry about this too much

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,360
i mean for instance in the supply chain

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,320
area which has been one of the early use

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,039
cases

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
where where blockchains have had some

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,360
success

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,039
um people ask well

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,600
what if um you have four

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,520
documents or you know what if the

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
inspection the customs official

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,559
said was done wasn't really done to get

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,640
slipped to bribe

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,840
and and those are absolutely legitimate

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,760
legitimate uh concerns to bring up

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,799
however i think sometimes we can get

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,520
into

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,000
the the perfect being the enemy of the

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,400
good

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
in these kind of discussions and even if

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
you kind of make it

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,280
harder to forge uh

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,799
you know four shipments that don't

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,840
actually exist

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,520
and that kind of thing if you making

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,520
even if you eliminate you know 75

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,000
of the fraudulent uh or unverified

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,200
transactions that may still be a win

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,440
even if you can't really get there uh

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
you know a hundred percent but this is

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
certainly something to think of

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,039
and uh and you know i think some of the

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,840
proposed use cases for blockchain

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,880
uh like some of the uh blind title

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,760
verification

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,000
and so forth when the problem is is that

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
you have very fragmentary

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,320
records that are scattered all over the

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,679
place in dusty county clerk

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,000
offices and situations like that

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
um yeah blockchain would be a good

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
answer

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,240
if you were maybe starting over from

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,559
scratch but it can be very hard

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:42,720
to deal with those legacy undigitized

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,559
systems this has been a big problem

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
early on i think some of the early

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,039
supply chain

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,159
work in particular struggled with this

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
that uh that you have come you often

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
have

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,520
competitors who are participating in

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,360
these business networks and they're

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,520
often not used to this level of

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,480
transparency

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,240
and cooperation they're not willing to

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,679
give up that control they're not

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,159
willing to change their existing

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,480
practices and fundamentally they just

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,919
don't want to cooperate with each other

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,400
at any level um and

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
under those circumstances it can be very

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,840
hard if

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
you know if you if only half your

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,960
suppliers

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,280
will sign up for the blockchain it's a

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,799
lot less useful if most of them do

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,919
so so i i think in the open source world

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,159
where where i do a lot of my work

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,240
we've we've kind of gotten used to

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,480
working together in open source

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,559
software in in this way where

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,600
competitors are working together

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,640
on an open source project however

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,080
um i think it's still very hard

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,600
for in many industries for organizations

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,720
to think about things

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
in that way and then finally then you

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,919
know this

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,880
um probably doesn't need much of an

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,240
introduction

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,600
or preamble uh but as with many other

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,919
things

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,440
if you're so if you're using blo

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,200
introducing blockchain

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,520
to solve a problem that really isn't

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,200
yeah it's kind of ugly in legacy and all

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,919
that kind of stuff but at the end of the

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,240
day

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,360
we have a working system it's not a big

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,280
deal

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:31,039
you know maybe just leave it

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,720
um these are some of the early use cases

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,840
that we've seen in blockchain

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,320
now if a few years ago you were some

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,600
presentation as general bain

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,520
you'd probably see slides filled with

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,480
hundreds of uh small print

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
types of places where blockchain could

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,720
have an

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,159
impact and we certainly see uh

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,360
pilot and even production projects in a

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,080
pretty wide range of areas um but

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,559
these are the ones that i would say we

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
see

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:10,240
most of the activity uh finance

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,360
is a big one um they're already used to

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,640
digitized electronic networks

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,360
some of the biggest opportunities

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,799
in in the near term that we've seen in

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,600
finance

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,320
are in various types of landing and

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,679
international transactions in areas

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,880
where

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,240
existing middlemen are missing

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,520
or they're they're very expensive so for

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,640
instance we've seen

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,039
a fair bit around international

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,559
transactions of various types

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:48,559
in areas of asia where there have been

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,679
fewer low-cost and well-established

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,279
middlemen of various sorts built up as

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,720
they tend to have been

00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:00,240
in the us and western europe um

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,039
public sector um i mentioned the

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,000
british columbia example of business

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,720
network

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
uh and various types and this is closely

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,360
related to that

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,600
of identity the british columbia example

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,720
was actually using hyperledger

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,760
indy and so governments are kind of

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,880
interested in that in terms of id cards

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,000
business records that kind of thing

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,520
supply chain and providence has been has

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,799
been talked about a lot

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,240
and is absolutely having some success uh

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:37,440
such as food trust network for example

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,919
there's a lot of concern about uh if

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
there

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,559
is an outbreak of um

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,000
bad food of some sort the desire to

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,400
really identify that

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,400
very quickly and not having to be

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,120
backtracking through records

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
that may be incomplete and it might take

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,559
you know months

00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,960
or more uh maybe months or more to

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,039
definitively spot the source of the

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
outbreak by which time it may very well

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,440
be too late to do much about it

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,320
um healthcare records this is

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,600
certainly a great hope particularly in

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,840
places where

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,200
electronic health care records have been

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,760
have a been a bit of a mixed bag

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,520
i think this also points out though to

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,120
some of the challenges with

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,840
with blockchain is to a degree that

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,520
entities can't agree in standards to a

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,640
degree that nts don't want to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,559
participate

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,679
in networks uh blockchain

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,919
can't really solve that political aspect

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,520
of things it can it can really help the

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,240
technical aspects

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
but if entities are not wanting to

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
cooperate

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,080
in that way and put their heads together

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,480
and agree on standards and processes

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,440
blockchain isn't going to magically

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
waltz in

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,559
and solve that problem um and i think

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,640
other types of identity i mentioned kind

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,440
of the public sector in particular but

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
there

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,840
there is a lot of interest in this idea

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,039
of people having self-sovereign

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,559
identities

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,880
and having more control over their

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,880
identity records then there's a real

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,960
mechanism to today

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,039
and then finally there is interest in

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,039
the telco space in here

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,880
you know again this this has to do with

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,559
there's a lot of transactions among a

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,440
lot of different entities

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,760
and doing the billing and reconciliation

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,720
for all that

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,360
um close and start talking very briefly

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,559
about what

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,400
red hat is doing here um

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,320
we're participating in select history

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,000
organizations and engaging with

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,799
customers and partners one of my

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,720
colleagues mark wagner is in both the

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,159
governing board and the technical

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,279
steering committee

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,960
for hyperledger specifically

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:06,480
um we're enabling red hat products uh

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,520
there were some security uh

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,360
things related to how hyperledger fabric

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,799
specifically was using

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,440
kubernetes openshift for example which

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,120
mark and

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,159
others uh have addressed uh so that

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,840
you you can run you you can run and rail

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,559
you can run on openshift uh and one of

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,640
the

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,000
and towards uh having hyperledger fabric

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,960
on openshift one of the projects that's

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,440
that's going on is development of an

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,360
operator for hyperledger fabric

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
uh for those of you not familiar with

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,960
operators

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,840
it's uh something that actually came out

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,600
of core os originally which red hat

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,159
acquired uh four kubernetes and four

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
opens

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,480
for openshift and the idea is that

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,360
with these increasingly complex pro pro

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
products

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,320
uh you really want to uh

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,600
codify some of the operational knowledge

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,200
in order to make uh you know to make

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,919
code uh to make code work and

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,080
therefore and the idea with an operator

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,320
is that we're you're essentially putting

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,279
the operational knowledge in order to

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,840
deploy and do the ongoing management

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,440
of that of the software that the

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,880
operator is for

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,640
uh and have it in a operator hub

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,640
that you can download and then use

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
finally before going to q a i'd just

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,760
like to clarify

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,200
that one of the things that we're not

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,559
doing is

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,760
a red hat blockchain products so we're

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,880
enabling red hat platforms

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,840
to run blockchain products starting with

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,039
hyperledger

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,559
fabric but we do have no plans to

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:02,000
sell our own product we are

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,640
we are really agnostic about technology

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,520
uh in terms of which particular

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,120
blockchain

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,200
platforms uh we work with but we've

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,880
today had the most customer interest

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,880
around hyperledger fabric

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,440
so with that uh we have a little time

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,440
for q a

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,600
and i am here

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,279
if um i've just jumped out of the little

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,320
box into the bigger box

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,320
uh if anybody has any questions for me

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,919
feel free to type them into the chat

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,919
um

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:55,120
going once going twice

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,799
going three times well

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,840
um thank you all for spending some time

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,120
and uh the as you can see the video

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,320
um the video is on youtube so

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,080
uh you know feel free to

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,600
share it with anybody who you think

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,120
might be interested

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,200
and the uh slide links are also going to

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,320
be posted in the schedule and

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,360
