Title: When I'm Remote, You're Remote
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Brandon Vulaj

In a world where the talent is everywhere, we need to be prepared to collaborate effectively with our co-workers wherever they may be. To be successful, we canâ€™t simply open up remote seats on our teams and hope for the best; we need to become remote-first in everything we do from hiring and infrastructure choices to communication and collaboration. The way we interact with our co-workers needs to fundamentally change. This has become even more apparent across the globe in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We will be going over some of the practices Iâ€™ve adapted and experimented with that help me work better as an individual and with a remote team. All of this will be presented with some historical context on the subject and how misunderstandings of the modern office can make or break your chances of cultivating a strong remote-first environment.

started with when i'm remote you're

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,759
rewarded by brandon fulash

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,600
brandon i believe we're going to be

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,600
showing the pre-recorded video right

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,920
enable your audio video once we get to

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
the q a part

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,600
hi i am brandon boulais i'm a software

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,960
engineer at red hat on openshift and

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
i've been remote for about

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
five years now a lot of us have been

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
shoved into remote work whether we

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
wanted to be or not because of the

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,160
global pandemic

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,600
so today we're going to go over a few

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,719
things that are going to help you both

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
as an individual

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,079
and as an organization we're going to

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
start with some history talk about some

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
pitfalls and how to even leverage those

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,239
pitfalls

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
and we're going to end with a few tips

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
so let's get started

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
one thing we need to understand before

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
we really go into anything else

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,640
is the bus length principle and this

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
states that communication between people

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,039
drops off radically

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
as soon as their distance from each

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
other exceeds the length of a school bus

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
it was initially coined by aleister

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,480
cockburn one of the founders of the

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
agile software movement

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,199
but we'll get back to him in a moment

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
because this goes back a little bit

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,920
further

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,119
to research conducted by professor

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
thomas allen

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,000
professor allen's research resulted in

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,840
what we know today as the allen curve

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
this shows there is a strong negative

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,040
correlation between physical distance

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,640
and frequency of communication now of

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
course this research was found to hold

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,520
true in the days before

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
more advanced collaboration tools were

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,479
available to us like slack

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,840
teams skype zoom every other thing

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
available today

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
but professor allen conducted this

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,759
research again in the early 2010s

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
and found almost exactly the same thing

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
to hold true

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,240
so the result of all this research over

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
the years

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
is that as a probability of in person

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,119
face to face increased

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
so did alternative means of

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,880
communications that's your chat email

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,560
phone and also vice versa as the

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
probability of face to face decreased

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,719
so did alternative means so this means

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
there was almost no substitution

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,920
of electronic communication for

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,680
face-to-face communication

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,960
therefore electronic communication was a

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,200
supplement and not a replacement

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,039
as you can imagine a lot of people read

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
and digested this research

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,040
so alan's work had really strong

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,040
influence in commercial architecture

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
project management and people management

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,520
now i'm sure this looks familiar to a

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
lot of you and i'm also sure

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
that probably none of you actually enjoy

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,040
working in an environment like this

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
but this happened because all of alan's

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,720
research

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
was taken at face value and his research

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
was used to rationalize these open floor

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
plans

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,040
and unfortunately high interrupt

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,120
environments because you know

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
closer is better because that's what

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,239
alan said

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,840
so we'll get into a little bit more

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,120
about why this is so bad

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,800
in a little bit but let's move on to

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
why this might actually be a good thing

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,640
so outside of the gut reaction that less

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
communication is bad

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
why is it really a problem what if we're

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,599
now all aware

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
of the lack of communication that can

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,599
happen and we work to more consciously

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
and actively communicate

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
well the problem really comes into

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,159
effect when we think about osmotic

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
communication

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,360
and how that affects our daily lives in

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,280
an office

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
osmotic communication is another term by

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,720
aleister cockburn

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
and it says information flows into the

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
background hearing of members of the

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
team

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,000
so that they pick up relevant

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,000
information as though by osmosis

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
so what this really means to you is

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
questions and answers flow naturally and

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,519
with surprisingly little disturbance

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
among the team

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
for example have you ever given an

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
incorrect answer to a co-worker and then

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
someone a row over comes over and

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
corrects you

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
that's asthmatic communication that

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
person wasn't sitting there actively

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,400
listening to your conversation

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,840
they just happened to process the

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
conversation in the back of their minds

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,319
while they were doing other things

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,319
the reason that electronic communication

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,000
doesn't replace osmotic communication

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,560
is because osmotic communication is

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
passive that is the people in the same

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
room don't necessarily have to

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
concentrate on each other to reap the

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
benefits

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,560
on things like slack and every other

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,480
form of electronic communication

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,760
that requires active attention you're

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
required to context switch from what

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,640
you're doing to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,720
participate or read a conversation

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
so while chat solutions help nothing

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,959
truly replaces osmotic communication

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
and because of this domain knowledge

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,960
does spread more slowly

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
on remote teams during his research

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
cockburn did admit that he had some luck

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,360
with teams utilizing

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,280
always on video cameras and microphones

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
but it ended up being really disruptive

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
and it didn't come close to really

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
replicating osmotic communication

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,240
so now you might be thinking all right

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,040
how do we solve this and unfortunately

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
we kind of don't all we can do is be

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
more conscious about the hurdles of

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
distributed teams

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,560
like the lack of osmotic communication

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,880
and move forward

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
build better repositories of information

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,040
keep conversations in

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,639
public channels not in dms and

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,280
take an active approach to keeping

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,039
everyone involved and informed

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
on the positive side once we start to

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
realize all these hurdles

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
we can actually start to leverage them

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
such as the case with osmotic

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,280
communication

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,880
because osmotic communication is noise

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
it is distracting even though it is

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
passive and when you're in an office

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,039
with a lot of people you're much more

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,360
likely to have someone come up and

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,800
bother you

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
so now we can start utilizing things

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
like the bus length principle as tools

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,759
being outside the bus zone creates an

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
effective cone of silence keeping you

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
and your team free from distractions

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,199
giving you time to really focus

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
distractions both passive and active are

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,320
one of the biggest unforeseen detriments

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,759
to projects

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,680
some of the best research for this topic

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,280
was done for the book peopleware

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,000
and if you haven't read it i really

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,680
can't recommend it enough

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,039
every year the authors put together a

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,759
coding challenge and they send this

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
around to

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
companies all over the world both large

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
and small

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
those taking part in the challenge were

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,600
asked to complete it in their normal

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,520
work environments

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
and year after year the authors found

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,759
that one thing affected overall quality

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
more than anything else

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,840
it wasn't the size of the company the

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,840
industry

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
is or even the experience level of the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,759
participants

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
in fact they found that those things had

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,160
almost no overall effect on how well

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
someone did on the challenge

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
instead what they found was that poor

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
performance on the challenge was usually

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,319
an indicator of a noisy office

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
environment

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
these poor performers often had to deal

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,120
with open floor plans

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,960
managers and co-workers constantly

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
bothering them or they were just set in

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
an awkward place like a call center

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,400
so for those of us that are going back

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
to an office this is something to keep

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,199
in mind

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
and by knowing where communication

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
begins to break down you can arm

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,880
yourself

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
allow you or your teammates more head

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
down time without being bothered and

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,280
decide when that increased rate at which

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
people interact and interrupt is

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
necessary

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
so now we can talk about what it really

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
means to be remote and why you should be

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,039
promoting remote first principles even

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
if everyone on your team is sitting in

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
an office

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,560
do you find yourself working with

00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,840
different people in regional offices

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,599
well congratulations

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,120
you're remote if you have co-workers in

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,919
different buildings across town

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,520
yep you're also remote is your qa team

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,000
further away than a school bus

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
still remote if you even have a single

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
teammate that works from home now and

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
then you better believe you're a remote

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
team

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,639
if you don't start thinking this way

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,919
it'll only serve to hurt performance and

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
your ability to scale your team into the

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,840
future

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
keep the research we've talked about

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,919
today in mind after we've wrapped up

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
so now that we've gotten some of the

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,360
more philosophical stuff out of the way

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
let's take a look at some more concrete

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
things that you can leave here with and

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,520
start implementing right away

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
these are all things that i try to do

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,319
myself that i've found have really

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,319
helped over my career as a remote worker

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
so this one is pretty straightforward as

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,840
we mentioned earlier you can't truly

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,120
replicate osmotic communication but that

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
doesn't mean we shouldn't do our best to

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
counter that

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
keep conversations public now first i

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
don't literally mean public

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
i mean as public as is appropriate

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,520
typically it makes sense to have

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
conversational rooms set up around teams

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,199
projects and organizations

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,879
you probably already do this right maybe

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
you have truly public channels for open

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
source projects or as a general public

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,440
forum

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,479
but usually i found that those team and

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
project channels are where you want to

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,639
keep most of your conversations

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
this way you're not creating noise in

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,240
higher level organizational channels but

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
you're also not limiting visibility for

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,440
those that would benefit from it

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
and then this way your teammates can

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,160
catch up on their own time and make

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,240
themselves aware of things that would

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
have been left in the dark on otherwise

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
important information can easily be lost

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,800
to history and dms

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,240
and this even touches back on what i

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
said earlier about building better

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
repositories of information

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,200
those repositories don't have to be a

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,039
wiki or anything like that

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
they can easily be pinned or searchable

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,760
messages in a team channel

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,039
i can't really tell you how many times

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
my team has ended up with pinned

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
messages that we reference

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,680
almost daily that simply came from

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
conversations

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,959
collaborating asynchronously is usually

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,399
one of the biggest issues people and

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,760
teams have when implementing remote

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,360
first practices

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,880
people talk over each other in meetings

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,640
they schedule meetings with half of the

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
attendees sitting in office while the

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
other half try and listen in

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,440
out of sight out of mind and also

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
remember that remote employees might

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,160
work a different schedule

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,519
and you don't want someone scheduling a

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,320
meeting when that remote person should

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,519
be spending time with their family

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,600
having been on the wrong end of those

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
meetings multiple times i have to tell

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
you it really sucks

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
people lose motivation and feel

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
uninvolved there is really no quicker

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,160
way to trash your remote first efforts

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
than by ignoring the fact that you need

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,519
to collaborate differently now

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
nobody is saying to get rid of meetings

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
i think we all know that they're a

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
necessary evil in most industries

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,920
but you do have to approach them

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,080
differently so

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,160
one if you want to pull the band-aid off

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399
stop reserving offices for meetings

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,519
trust me you really don't need them when

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
one person is remote

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,080
everyone's remote let people call from

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
their desks at home or in the office

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,640
and this way everyone is involved at the

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,880
same level and nobody feels left out

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,920
two as we hinted at above be aware of

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
time zones

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,600
i don't schedule 4 pm meetings not only

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,440
because nobody likes those but

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,120
also because it's 11 at night for my

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,320
teammates in tel aviv

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
everyone who's working remote on a

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,360
global scale knows that schedules need

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to flex a little bit later earlier

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,040
sometimes

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,040
but just keep it reasonable and three

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
use collaborative documents i'm sure

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,680
you've had to deal with people talking

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
over each other in virtual meetings even

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
though they don't mean to

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
that's just the nature of virtual

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
meetings what you can do is make sure

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,880
every meeting that's scheduled has a way

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
for everyone to collaborate

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
my favorite way and the easiest way i've

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,560
found is just use live

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
documents these are things like drive or

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
whatever else your organization may

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
be utilizing already not only does this

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
let people get their thoughts out

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,079
without interrupting

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,839
it also makes it easier for the less

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,440
extroverted people to contribute

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,640
and as a bonus you end up with a

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
naturally occurring set of meeting

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,079
minutes

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
so this might sound similar to our

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,440
previous slide but now we're going to

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
focus on your day-to-day communication

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,320
rather than meetings

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,480
the biggest habit you have to break is

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
the naked ping the naked ping is any

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
message that conveys zero information

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
all the naked ping does is force

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,720
attention it makes that person stop what

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,959
they're doing

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
context switch and respond simply to see

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
what you need in the first place

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,399
it's disruptive and as we talked about

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
earlier unnecessary disruptions are a

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
huge detriment to organizations

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,920
even with something small like this when

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
multiplied over and over

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
the other reason you should avoid the

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,880
naked ping is due to how easily contacts

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640
can just be lost or forgotten

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
if a person decides to ignore that naked

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
ping as they very well may because

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,399
they're busy

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
the sender may forget why they even sent

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,160
it in the first place that person may

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
not even be busy they may be asleep or

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
it may be their weekend

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
meaning they won't see that message for

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,480
a day or more our brains often forget

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,200
what we wanted to ask someone seconds

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,959
after just chatting them up

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,959
fixing this is really as simple as just

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,000
providing the smallest bit of context

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,760
so instead of hey are you around or ping

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
just say hey can you help me with ticket

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
number one two three or

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,440
hey when you have a minute let's meet

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
about xyz

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
for those familiar with red hat's

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,920
company-wide mailing list memolist

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
this was brought up as an industry

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,440
problem as far back as 2009.

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,959
the original email has been published in

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,040
a few places on the web since then if

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,959
you care to track it down

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
this practice holds true for anyone in

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
office or otherwise

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
but we're talking about what being

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
remote first means the fact that you're

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
probably remote and don't realize it

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
and so much of this just makes in-office

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,399
life smoother as well

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
ah this one people are either going to

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,440
love or hate but it's important or it

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,959
wouldn't be here

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,639
meet like you would in person is my

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,760
fancy way of saying just keep your

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
cameras on

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,200
one of the biggest obvious differences

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
between remote and non-remote work is

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
the frequency that you interact with

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,079
people face to face

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
we talked about this a lot earlier so

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
you should try to increase that face

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,160
time whenever possible

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
too much is lost in translation when we

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
can't read each other and the team will

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
just naturally feel more engaged

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
even if your teammates don't do it just

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,120
start doing it people often catch on

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,880
and if they don't well maybe you suggest

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,160
that they watch this talk if you just

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
have to book a conference room for

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,959
something

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,320
it must have an audio video system don't

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,600
force people out of sight and out of

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,279
mind

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
we all have lives outside of work and

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
those often collide when we're in a home

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,760
office

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
so don't worry if your kids walk in or

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
if you have dogs running around in the

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,160
background which if i had my video on

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,519
right now that's what you'd be seeing

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,480
nobody cares it's humanizing and on a

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,399
similar note

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
keep meeting like you would in person

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,399
outside of our work face to face time we

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,160
also miss out on social events and just

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,680
things like grabbing a coffee or running

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
into a friend in the hallway

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
these otherwise natural touch points are

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,160
completely non-existent in fully

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,440
distributed teams

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
we may not even realize that we're

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,240
missing out on these really important

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
aspects of relationship building with

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
our co-workers

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,519
the easiest thing to do and it really

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,399
does help is schedule some social time

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,320
with your team

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,000
personally i like one-on-ones these

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
aren't your typical manager report style

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,079
101s these are just with your peers

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
i like to keep these strictly social

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,440
either grab a coffee or even grab a beer

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
and ask your teammate what they're doing

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
this weekend

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,240
you can even complain about work and of

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
course you can schedule team social

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
hours too

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,279
i feel like these have become somewhat

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,199
popular with everyone in quarantine

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,959
on the note of the quarantine i do want

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,720
to tell everyone new to remote work that

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,519
this is not what remote work is usually

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,360
like

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,639
even if your company was really focused

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,440
on remote first principles during the

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,279
pandemic

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
a lot of us are now missing out on our

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
out-of-work social activities whether

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
it's just

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,720
meeting up at a friend's house going to

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,760
sporting events or whatever it is you

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
and your friends like to do in your free

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
time

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
the pandemic has severely limited these

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,160
activities for most of us and it really

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,600
does take its toll

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,600
i know your transition to remote work

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
may have been a trial by fire

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,040
a lot of us didn't expect to be remote

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
this entire year or even into next year

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
and on if we weren't already

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,880
and i'm sure we've all had both good and

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,680
not so good experiences with it along

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,000
the way

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
i truly believe that remote is the

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
future

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
more organizations around the world are

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,120
realizing that it's possible to keep an

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
effective workforce

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,160
without having to maintain office space

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
among other things

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
so if you're not promoting a remote

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
first culture right now somebody else is

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
and they're going to be ahead of the

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,000
curve when it comes to retention

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,199
and hiring every candidate from here on

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
out is going to be asking is this

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,399
position remote

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
so get ready for that hopefully this

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,040
session has given you some tools to

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
start that transition or even help it

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
along the way

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
if you want to chat about remote work or

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
anything else please get in touch at any

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,839
links below

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,839
and thanks for coming to my session

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,639
awesome thank you for that great talk

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,240
brendan

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,680
so if there any questions from brandon

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,199
hey guys hello

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
thank you for the claps

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,240
if you want you can also enable your

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
audio video if you just want to have a

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
discussion as well

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,360
we have a lot of time oh you guys can

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,560
see me right

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
yeah yeah okay great

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,199
uh yeah there is a youtube link for this

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,320
which i think will be provided

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,880
correct or the reporting will be

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,759
provided yeah we did not bend that out

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,759
but then chat right now

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,680
i think there were some questions

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,680
earlier on

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,639
mostly about misinterpreting allen's

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,000
research and cost cutting

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,560
i'm i can't pretend to know if that's

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,160
exactly what was happening um but it

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,600
sounds kind of obvious right i'm not a

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
commercial architect and i design

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,759
offices

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
but i'm sure the whole osmotic

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,959
communication

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:23,839
studies had a lot to do with the excuses

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:23,839
that were made for cost cutting measures

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
do i notice the quality of my work and

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,480
my team's work have improved since being

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,880
remote

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,639
um i don't know if this is a great

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
question for me personally because my

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,160
teams have always been remote we didn't

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,000
have a big switch

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,160
at the beginning of the pandemic to make

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
everyone remote

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,120
but i've talked to a lot of friends and

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
colleagues that weren't remote before

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,800
this and

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
i've mostly found that work has either

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,639
stayed steady or improved

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,519
i haven't really heard anyone that found

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,720
remote work

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,279
you know was a detriment to their

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,360
day-to-day work

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,199
here's a question by till math have you

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,799
tried other competition styles than

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:08,480
sitting in front of the screen uh yep

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,079
um i can't say i've really taken note of

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
how those

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,439
have changed the conversation for better

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
or worse but

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,679
i'll often you know take my laptop down

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
to my couch and

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,000
you know especially when i'm doing

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
one-on-ones with my co-workers like the

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,280
social one-on-ones

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,559
i'll almost always try and not sit at my

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
desk um

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,240
i'll go down to my kitchen or my living

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,720
room or even outside

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
and sit on my laptop usually yeah i have

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,799
tried that i prefer that

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,200
it makes things a little a little more

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,200
casual

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,120
i for one have sat on my couch multiple

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
times

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,120
how do i set up the camera on the couch

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,480
so uh usually

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,760
it's at an awkward angle on the couch um

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,039
i have um like a little couch table that

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
kind of like pulls over your couch a

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,919
little bit

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,280
that kind of sits my laptop at a normal

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,160
level instead of

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,480
just on my lap so that kind of brings

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,880
your

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
your laptop's camera to a more natural

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,559
level than

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:28,080
you know shining up into your face which

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,440
no one really wants to see right

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,799
also i've experimented with you know

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,600
external webcams too i'm using an

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,440
external one right now

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,039
because they're usually higher quality

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,240
um you can always take those around and

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,320
position them wherever you want

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,320
but i usually don't usually don't do

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,240
that sorry i'm trying to type and then i

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
realize that i'm

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,520
just gonna run out of time and then go

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600
like well let's go sure

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,039
i'm just gonna quickly ask i've been

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
remote for a long time and i'm in danger

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,360
of being one of those people who makes a

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
comment instead of a question so i'm

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,200
gonna not

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,880
do that and what i'm curious about is

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
what you think about the

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
the things you're talking about now you

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,440
know and also the pets going in the

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,360
background and things that are all

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,720
where you know when i started i kept it

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,640
secret so no one knew how to

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,080
vote so you know what do you think about

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,960
the cultural shifts that are happening

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
and how the acceptances is um going on

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
in television because some of the chat

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
that's going on is people talking about

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
how they want to share this with people

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
who are just not into it they're not

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,400
quite getting it they're resisting

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,559
so that's my question um so

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
my your question is the experience with

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
people who who weren't quite

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,280
ready for this right like they they just

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
didn't understand remote work and now

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,720
we're kind of forced into it right

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
yeah the cultural shift and how that

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
feels yeah

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
yeah i mean i can only really comment on

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,880
like the people i've talked to um

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,360
you know family members co-workers um

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
friends

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,280
who have had this drastic shift to

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
remote work that

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,520
um where they had no plans of doing so

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,240
before and i've heard varying stories of

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,000
um you know there's a success stories of

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,440
people that like were not super

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
for remote work and um they saw that oh

00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
it was

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,200
actually nicer to not have to commute

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
into the office every day and

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
um you know their work didn't really

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
degrade too much

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,320
um if at all right work may have

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,360
improved which is usually the case i've

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
found

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,440
but unfortunately there's i think

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
there's still cases of

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,720
people trying to treat remote work a

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,240
little too much like in office work

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,159
like they're expecting people to um

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,280
you know they're expecting their literal

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
work environments to

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,360
you know be clean and professional and

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
that's fine right if

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,480
um you can have whatever you want in

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,919
your background um

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,520
but but i've heard some stories where

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,320
people just

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,280
probably won't get it um but hey maybe

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:49,840
you can send them this talk

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:49,840
they'll know i'm talking about them

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,520
one more question any ideas on how to

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,760
get a traditional manufacturer on board

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,400
with some of these remote work ideas

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,919
we rely heavily on osmotic communication

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
and meeting rooms the point of having

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,120
co-workers in different buildings in

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,480
different countries really hits home

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,120
since our physical footprint is

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,120
worldwide

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,559
i mean i don't have experience working

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,080
in traditional manufacturing um

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,679
but i think you are driving the point

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,760
home yourself right you are

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,120
already working in a global environment

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,880
and i assume you are already

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,159
communicating and working

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,840
you know across the world with all these

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,480
different teams when you can right

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,840
would start expanding that and maybe

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,080
just taking that point to your

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,919
managers bosses whoever needs to you

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,760
know know those things and say look we

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
we're already a remote workforce we we

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,640
know we are um

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,039
because we have people over the world

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,000
that aren't sitting here in an office

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,280
and however you're interacting with

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
those teams you should probably try

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
implementing that with even your local

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
teams

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:13,840
i wonder what the other half of that

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:15,200
question is

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,760
django is my dog they're wondering where

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,760
my dog is

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,080
not in the room right now yeah

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
yeah i said it was okay to have dogs

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,240
running around right so now they're

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,240
outside

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:41,840
good questions though

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,280
okay alex's question

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,640
despite having an incredibly

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
successfully forced remote work

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
experiment are still hesitant to fully

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,360
allow remote long term

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,120
what would you suggest to help get some

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
of these managers over the barrier

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,600
well what i would suggest is just

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,120
presenting

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,960
your experience co-workers experience

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
during this time right

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
present data right they're hopefully

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
making these decisions

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
based on data and if you're showing

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,039
someone that

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,039
work has stayed the same or improved

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,480
while you're remote um

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,919
i think it would be relatively hard for

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,080
someone to say oh but we still have to

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,520
get you know butts back in seats

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,799
i can't promise you that they're not

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,080
going to say no we still have to all

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,080
come back into the office

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,440
you know in the middle of 2021 but um

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
but i think the longer we stick with

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
this and i don't think i think a lot of

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,640
people are probably not going to

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,840
back to the office anytime soon i think

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
people are going to become more

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,880
comfortable with it

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,400
i already know a lot of people that even

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,360
after the few months they've spent

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,720
remote

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,120
don't ever want to go back into an

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:51,840
office ever again and you know i i don't

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,840
either right i don't blame them

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
yeah and we can open this up and if

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
anyone wants to share audio video just

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
request and i'll give you access

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,559
we can make this an open floor the next

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,279
talk is not till 4 20 pm eastern so we

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,279
have a lot of time

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
or even if anyone just wants to talk

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,080
about their experiences

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,840
no there we go another question

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,039
what are your favorite tools to make up

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,720
for the lack of osmotic communication

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,400
so my favorite tool isn't necessarily a

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
technical tool it's more of a practice

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
right and that was kind of what i hinted

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,840
back

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,919
at um in a couple of my slides in that

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,039
just keep those conversations public

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,320
um stop dming people stuff gets lost in

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,520
dms

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
all the time right you'll never find

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,240
that stuff you'll you'll forget who you

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,960
asked the question about or who

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,080
you're talking um about with this topic

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,360
um

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,679
and it gets even worse when you can have

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
dms with multiple people at once right

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,039
so i would just recommend every single

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,480
conversation you can just have it in

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,279
your team's channels

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,440
i i don't know if you have um you know

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,679
proper

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,640
chat tools and stuff at you know at your

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,440
office

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,320
we we use slack and i like that it's

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,720
just fine

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,840
but i would say the best tool is just

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
keeping that conversation public

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,279
we've had really good luck with like i

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,640
mentioned in the talk too

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,240
with pinning messages again that's up to

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,559
the implementation never chat tool

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,559
but we have a ton of information just

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,279
stashed in different pins in our team

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,760
room

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,559
from you know common urls and practices

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,559
to all sorts of stuff

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,880
so hopefully that answered that question

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,880
that's your question is there one thing

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
though that you met about being in an

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,000
office environment

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,279
i do so before the pandemic i

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,039
actually had rented some co-working

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,039
space and i know a lot of remote workers

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,720
co-working space especially in larger

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,440
cities where not everyone has a home

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,640
office to work out of

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,360
and i found myself collaborating with

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,720
people i

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,840
don't work with for my day job right

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,360
there was a lot of other developers

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,320
there if i had a technical issue or

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
something i might

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,840
you know go talk to someone who i knew

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,960
was using the same tech stack and

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,039
even though he didn't work for my

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,559
company but i could walk over and chat

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,480
with him about problems and

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,600
i think that's one of the things i miss

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,039
is you know

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,360
talking with someone about solving a

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,679
problem um that's what developers like

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,760
doing right we like solving problems and

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,159
doing that with someone is can even feel

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,520
better right

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,000
and just the camaraderie of the office

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,279
is real really what i miss right

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,279
and that's one of the reasons i think

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,720
it's important to continue talking with

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,600
your co-workers even if your state's

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,640
away or how

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,919
however far away you are um just video

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,080
call one-on-one just like this

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
right you just get more of that social

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,400
aspect back in your life and i think

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,000
that's

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,080
really what an office is providing a lot

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,640
of right it's forcing those

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
you know those social touch points that

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,120
you don't really have when you're

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,120
sitting at home in an office

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,400
the one thing that i do miss is we would

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,720
have happy hours

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,840
so that's when you get people in the

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
office even though you don't directly

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,720
work with them

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,559
um you get to talk with them and just

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,159
you know it's a different environment so

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,039
that's one thing i definitely miss and i

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,480
guess for

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,480
teams that are important worldwide

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
that's what conferences sort of do

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,159
um when at first then you get to meet

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,440
these people that you've been talking to

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,279
by a screen for so much

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,240
for so many like years or months or

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,679
however long you've been working with

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,480
them and you get to have that face to

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,960
face

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,919
yeah in a while definitely is really

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,480
nice

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,520
my current team at red hat i've never

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,279
met any of them

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,720
first in person right i've been working

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,480
with them for over a year now

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,320
um and because of the pandemic which

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,640
canceled the trip for us we

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,600
i i've never met them right i talk to

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,039
them and work with them every day but

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,559
i've never actually met them

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,919
um and you know i was looking forward to

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,039
physically going to this conference too

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,600
but you know this is also nice

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,720
that's better than no confidence i guess

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,720
right definitely better than no

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
conference

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,799
next question do you find audio video

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,799
prompts to be superior detect face comps

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,200
for your team

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,200
so i think they're different um the

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
problem with audio and video comms is i

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
think

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,960
you personally get a lot more out of

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,520
audio and video

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,960
but you're now losing that documentation

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,279
that that conversation happened

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,039
is if you're not writing notes right if

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,520
you're not taking minutes

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,960
the nice part about the text base comms

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,039
is what we just talked about is

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,559
you have this naturally occurring set of

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,679
discussions in a team channel that you

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,279
can always reference back

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,559
hopefully but it's it's very common that

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,480
you know

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,240
if we can't work through a problem over

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,679
text chat we'll say let's hop on a video

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,159
call

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,760
and work through it so i think they're

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,440
different not necessarily

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,399
one is better than the other

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,799
okay i'm not seeing any more questions

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
pop

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,640
up um if you want you can hang out here

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,360
or you can also

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,080
step out it's up to you the next step in

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,320
the track is at 4 20 p.m eastern i will

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,919
send the name of the talk in the chat

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,600
great all right i'll hang out here and

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,799
text chat but i'm going to hop off audio

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,320
video thanks everyone

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,320
