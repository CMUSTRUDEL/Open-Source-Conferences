Title: User Onboarding – Get the User on Board!
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Sangeeta Raghu-Punnadi

User onboarding is guiding users to use your product and find value in it. Users understand how to use your product to meet their goals. You may have the best product, but if the users cannot figure out how to get started, they will never use your product. This is where User Onboarding helps!
The session covers:
• What is user onboarding
• User onboarding strategies
• Onboarding based on user personas and journeys
• User onboarding artifacts:
◦ In the app:
• Welcome messages
• Guided product tours
• Task lists & progress bars
• Tooltips, in-app messaging
◦ External:
▪ Marketing emails
▪ Product release emails
▪ Help topics
• Examples of companies that use good onboarding to guide their users
• Examples of onboarding tools to get started
• Retiring an onboarding artifact
The session will help the audience to think about onboarding strategies and which artifacts to include in their products!

thank you so much um hi everybody thank

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,279
you so much for attending this session

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,279
uh let's get started

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
so um what what sense your product also

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
looking at

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,680
when they actually choose your product

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,520
product value how does the product help

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
uh how is the product going to help the

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,840
user is it going to help them achieve

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,559
their business

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,920
goals um how is the user experience i

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,680
mean how easy or difficult

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
would it be for their employees to sort

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,960
of adopt your product

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,879
and do you have user onboarding or tips

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
and tricks to help that users get

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,920
started

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
so in this session we shall be looking

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
at the what how

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,080
why of user onboarding

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,720
as always let's begin with the textbook

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,080
definition so wikipedia says

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,159
uh user onboarding is the process of

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
improving a person's success with a

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,320
product

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,880
so um what it means

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,840
it's it means helping the users use your

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,000
product without

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,920
too much of effort um it means uh they

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
don't have to go around looking for

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
help when they're using your product

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,759
rather your product is intuitive enough

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,280
or has enough help inside

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,119
to keep that moving uh it also means

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,159
talks about the users reaching their aha

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
moment

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
so what's uh what's an aha moment um

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,320
it's a moment of sudden insight or

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,360
discovery uh the point at which your

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
user is gonna

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
understand the value your product brings

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
in

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
so if i want to convert a doc file into

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
a pdf the moment i convert it into a pdf

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
i have my aha moment

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,000
i know exactly how your product is going

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
to help me

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
so let's break this up a bit so when a

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
user comes to your product they come

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
with a lot of apprehensions

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
is this application going to help me how

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
do i get started

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,760
am i going to achieve my goal so every

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
time we try something new

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,800
we have a lot of questions we have a lot

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
of fear

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
so an answer would be to make the

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,840
journey more

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
easier for the user right so the answer

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,720
to

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,560
all these questions is providing good

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
user onboarding

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
so what does user onboarding actually do

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
it sort of provides

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,800
a starting point for your users to use

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,400
your software or your product

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,640
it helps the user get started

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
imagine that a user is trying to use a

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,680
trial version of the

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,519
of the application and they just can't

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
get started so they will leave the

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
product and go to some other product

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,720
so it's very important that we have good

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
guidance of pointers to help the users

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,239
get started how do you get the user

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
started

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,760
you could do your mess you could use

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,920
messages tool tips

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
you could use a combination of animated

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,840
gifs regular gifs

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,560
product doors to help the user get

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,319
started

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
so before we get into the details of

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
user onboarding let's look at an example

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
so that we all are on the

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
same page so this is

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,799
uh this is the home page of an

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,920
application called as ganbar

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,239
which is used to create graphics now

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
imagine i'm a first time user and i come

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,000
to the screen

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,840
i would be intimidated i would be scared

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,200
and i just don't know where to start

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
so what does kanwa do the screen that

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,400
actually comes up once you log

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
in for the first time in kanba is this

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
screen

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,640
so if you see here they have categorized

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,000
uh according to uh the user personas

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,799
or the user requirement so if you're a

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
teacher

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
what sort of graphics you can create if

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
you're a student what kind of graphics

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,760
you can create

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
so based on the persona they have

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,799
various

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
templates available so as a first time

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
user

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,120
it's easier for me to choose right so

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,239
say

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,639
i choose personal

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,240
so the next screen that comes up is this

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,919
so what is the onboarding statement that

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
kanwa is trying to tell us that

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
we are going to help you create your

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
first design we are going to handhold

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
you

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
so that you understand how to use our

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,560
application and by the end of this

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,440
you have your first graphics or uh or

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,800
order design

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,840
created now if i click presentation here

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,440
i come into this presentation space

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,600
and uh what kanwa has done is uh to

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,040
to help the user understand their

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,440
application better

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,880
they have created a product door so

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
product door is

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
is actually a tour of your product so on

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
the click of

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,960
next button i'm going to go from one

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
bubble to the next

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,160
and that's going to help me understand

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,520
or navigate the

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,759
ui so by the end of this end of this

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,720
hand holding i would have created my

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,400
presentation so now i know how how to

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
work with kanwa i know how the

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,320
application

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,160
uh looks like and the next time i log in

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
i go back to the home screen

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
the first screen that i showed with with

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
all the graphic images

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,880
but now i'm not scared i understand the

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,680
product better

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,680
and it i can create my designs on my own

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
so where can you uh how can you onboard

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,440
the user

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
so you can onboard them in the

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,720
application

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,919
and you can onboard them out of the

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
application

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,720
so within the application uh you could

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,160
use your welcome screens

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,479
your tooltips um product doors

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
some indicators on the ui to onboard the

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,080
user

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
and out of the application it's going to

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
be more text

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
it's going to be a help topics your

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
promotional emails

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
so together the in-app and the external

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
onboarding artifacts

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
should have a common goal of helping the

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
user use

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,919
understand your application better use

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,600
your product in a

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:26,080
better way

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,639
so in short you have artifacts in your

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,479
application you have some amazing

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
functionality in your application so

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
you're going to link

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,440
these functionalities to the artifacts

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,000
and have interaction with the you with

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,039
the users

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,960
at regular intervals for example kanba

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,560
so what did they do they already had

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,360
templates created

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,520
which is and categories created in the

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,800
starting they just added a new

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,800
uh dialog with these categories

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
so that it's easier for the user to

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
choose

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,440
they could have left the user on the

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
home page but they you know

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,400
they thought it would be a better way

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,199
easier for the users if if they have

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,880
a window that sort of uh shows off all

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
the categories

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
so that's what we need to think how we

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,680
can link our application

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,400
to our existing artifacts

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,599
so if you have web-based application uh

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,160
these are a list of

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,560
uh some onboarding platforms uh they're

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
a combination of proprietary and open

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
source

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,960
um they have some really really good uh

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
onboarding you can create really good

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,680
onboarding artifacts

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,240
so all the artifacts that i'm going to

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,759
be talking about today can be created by

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
using these applications

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
um the proprietary applications are

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
available

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,319
as uh browser extensions and

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,400
the open source ones would require a

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,120
little bit more of uh programming

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,680
knowledge

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,639
so even if you don't want to like invest

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
maybe in these

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
applications do check out their trial

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,280
versions because they give you a very

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
good idea about

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,919
what sort of onboarding artifacts you

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
can create

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,599
so let's begin by understanding how do

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
we create

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
an onboarding strategy

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
so everything is going to be begin with

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,680
a business goal so

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
what business school do you want to

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
achieve with a particular onboarding

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
strategy

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
for example kanwa their onboarding

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,800
strategy was to help the user

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,639
create their first graphic

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
so how do you analyze so once you've

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,640
decided the user goals

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
you're going to see for that goal what

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
are the user personas

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,279
so what are your user personas what are

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
what are your user

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,959
what is the user journey for those

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,320
personas what is the technical level of

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,640
your users

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,399
so once you have this data you're going

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,880
to sit together and think

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,680
which user persona and which user

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
journey

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,480
is going to require onboarding so for

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
example say you have admin tasks and you

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
have end user tasks

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,680
so for for an administrator which

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
tasks do you think are going to require

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,560
onboarding strategy

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,200
what functionality or what use case

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
would uh would a user require help with

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,000
so you're going to sit back

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,839
think about it if you have analytics you

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
could use analytics

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
to decide the functionalities where you

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,880
want to create onboarding strategy

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
say your your users are churning out at

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,480
upper

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
in at a particular functionality um you

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
create a

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,640
strategy around that so once you have

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,440
your onboarding strategies in place

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,440
um discussions with your stakeholders

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,720
you create the strategy

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,240
publish it but uh

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,760
you keep reviewing your onboarding

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
strategy because every time you have a

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,720
new feature or a new

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
uh release out you may have to change it

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,920
so we will be talking about the shelf

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
life of onboarding

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,880
artifacts as well

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,200
so let's look at the type of uses that

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,200
you can address

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
so typically in an application you're

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,760
going to have three three users three

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,839
types of users

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,920
first time users are the users who come

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,880
into your application for the first time

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,279
so an onboarding strategy here would be

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
to

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,839
help them get started

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,399
basic users the onboarding strategy here

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,120
would be to make them into power users

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,240
and of course applications might have

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,079
power users

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
and here the onboarding strategy would

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,640
be to help them discover

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,440
more complex features and help them use

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
the product

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
even better

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
so once a user decides to use a

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
particular

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,640
application they are always in a hurry

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
to get started

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,440
uh so since uh if we continue with the

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,399
example of wanting to create a pdf from

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
a doc file

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,399
i go to the internet i search for an

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
application i download it and now i want

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
to

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,839
uh the next thing i want to do is just

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
create my pdf

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
i don't want to waste too much of time

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,560
filling in forms

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,760
or trying to configure it so

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,000
most applications these days uh

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,920
use single sign-on so you can use your

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,040
google account or your facebook account

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,920
to sort of get get into any application

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,440
so the strategy here would be to give

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,959
access to your product

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,519
as soon as possible so once the user has

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,640
access to your product the first screen

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,279
that they're going to see

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,079
is the welcome screen and a lot of times

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,320
you know we

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,480
can sort of ignore the welcome screen or

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
the welcome dialog box it's just like

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
welcome to product

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,560
uh abc version one two three no you

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,920
could probably do a little more

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,600
with your welcome screen let's see how

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
so as i said this is the first

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,959
interaction user is going to have

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
with your application a lot of emphasis

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,760
these days

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,519
is on personalization so you could

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,560
welcome the users with their name um

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,079
show reiterate the product value

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,399
because that sort of uh helps the user

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,000
makes the user more sure of you know

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,040
what this product does

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,760
so uh give a line that that actually

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,839
tells you

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
what is it is that what is the business

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
goal you can achieve with this

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
particular

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,880
product or the usp of your product list

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
a couple of more functionalities of your

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
product

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,079
so apart from so say i have come to your

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,880
product to do a particular task

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,680
and if you list say i can do b and c as

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
well

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,160
as a user it sort of helps me realize

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:39,839
that okay i can use this product

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,839
for doing these other tasks as well

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,040
you could use a combination of image and

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,959
text really good micro copy

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
use the voice and tone of your

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,240
organization

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
so everything in the welcome screen

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,920
should talk uh

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,399
talk about your product as your product

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,959
would speak to the user

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,600
and in the welcome screen you can

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,440
actually

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
split um the users the onboarding based

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
on user

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
persona or user journey for example

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
admin tasks

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,639
versus uh end user task so this split

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,760
the same was converted

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,320
you could do it in your welcome screen

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,399
so let's look at some examples so this

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,079
is the welcome screen from dropbox

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,800
so what they have done is they have used

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,079
floating windows or scrolling windows

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,279
and they also have added an animated gif

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,639
inside to sort of

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,519
show how the application works so they

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
have a pro

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
they have the functionality listed up

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,920
there

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,959
they have good graphics and they also

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
have given a link

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
to the intro video so you don't have to

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
actually go

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,399
and create a video if you have an

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
existing marketing video that would work

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,440
as well because

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,880
the user here just wants to know how to

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,320
get started

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,560
and just uh understand uh what is it

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,760
that your product brings

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,240
in their organization

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,440
so once you once you click the get

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,000
started button

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
you're going to get into the uh dropbox

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
application

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,079
so what does dropbox do to help you

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,959
further they have

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,199
a new for you window here and this

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,440
window slides out only on the click of

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,920
an

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
arrow so it's not going to interfere in

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,480
their actual

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,519
application and here they have listed

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,920
whatever is new in the release

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,399
they don't stop there they also have

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,519
used animated gif to actually

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,480
show how you're going to achieve that

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
and they have a call to action buttons

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,240
that actually

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,279
start um that actually start that

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,720
functionality

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,160
so you can actually download dropbox

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,880
from here

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,760
or you can actually create a shared

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
folder

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,320
from this window as well so they don't

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,519
expect you to sort of

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,880
go and search for share a folder uh

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,600
button or

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,199
command in the application rather you

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,240
can get started just

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,680
right here so that's a very good example

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
of onboarding the user

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,880
just in time in the place where they are

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,880
right now

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,120
uh this is a screen from red hat so when

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,519
you get into the insights

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,279
dashboard you can see that you have a

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,160
couple of lines that tell you

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,759
what does insight actually do and it

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,839
also helps the user

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,360
get started so they tell you if you want

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,040
to begin

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,800
these are the commands that you need to

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,360
use and if you need

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,880
some more information here is a link to

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,759
our getting started

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
documentation

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,959
so this this pattern that i have used in

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,040
my uh in my

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
presentation shows what you can do after

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,519
you go back

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,360
uh sort of a takeaway slide so for if if

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,639
welcome screens what can you do better

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,160
in your welcome screens

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,279
add what value your product brings in

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,839
uh use some good text and images

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
um good micro copy to create the

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,600
function

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,680
uh the value that your product brings uh

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,240
list a couple of functionalities

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,959
as i said you could use uh give a link

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
to your

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
video so that it's easier for the users

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,839
who don't want to sort of go and read

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,519
through all the text you could give a

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,240
link to the product or

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,360
you're going to see that next and

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,880
wherever possible

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,480
always give a link documentation or your

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
learning management system

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,839
because that's that's where the users

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
are going to get more information

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,360
so let's look at a demo of a product or

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
first and then we'll talk about it so

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,320
product doors

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:54,000
are actually guide the users

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,079
in your application and you can actually

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,920
ask the users to interact with your

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,839
application in a product or

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,120
so that by the end of it they have

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,680
achieved a goal

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,640
so in this video we're going to see how

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,480
to create

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
a task in gmail

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,439
so if you see here the user is actually

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
expected to

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,280
click the icon so the instructions that

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,959
are given to the user

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,400
are click the task icon so once the user

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,079
clicks the task icon the application is

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
of course invoked in gmail because

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,840
that's what it does

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,919
and then the user is asked to click the

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,480
add uh add a task button

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,760
after that actually write the task that

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,760
you want to

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,760
want to add to the list and after that

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,080
we have further gone and shown them how

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,679
to complete a task as well

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,640
so um and and at the end of this

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,160
you can also ask feedback if the store

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
was good or bad

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,440
so i created this tool using what fix

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
which is the

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,720
proprietary software but in short

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,320
you can you can actually use product

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,600
tools to

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,080
help the users interact with your

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,080
software

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,080
so with product tools you can provide

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,280
guidance on how to use your

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
you use your application they are action

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
oriented

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,240
because at the end of it you would have

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,720
achieved a user goal

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,960
so in in the example that we saw we

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,240
actually created a task

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,080
so that way if you have any any um

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
any functionality that you want the user

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
to complete a business use case

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,520
you could actually create a product tool

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,840
to help the users

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,840
achieve that particular goal

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,679
and you could create it for your first

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
time users basic users different

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,880
personas

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
so if you use the onboarding platforms

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,799
you can actually

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
list all the product doors in a window

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,520
and and sort of display

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
it in your application

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,640
a common use of product doors is to

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,559
highlight new features because it's new

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,720
the users haven't seen it before and

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,960
having a product door where you actually

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,960
guide them the clicks and the

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
configurations on your ui

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,919
would help them understand the

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,919
functionality better

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,200
and uh with product rules don't try to

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,679
make it too complicated

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
achieve you know stick to that one user

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,520
goal that you want to achieve because

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,440
sometimes you can do two three things

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,840
and that's only going to confuse your

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
user

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,760
so what do you do after you go back so

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,600
if you decide to invest

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,240
in um in the platforms or you decide to

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,120
um use some coding knowledge to create

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,440
product tours

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
uh definitely have a getting started

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
toward

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
uh product or so getting started product

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
tour

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
is a tool that's automatically invoked

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,240
uh the first time the user

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,919
uh comes into your application so it's

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,799
going to take the user around your

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,880
application

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,000
and and sort of show the different

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,840
features that are

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,080
available if you don't want to invest in

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,799
product doors you could use animated

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,080
gifs the same way as dropbox did

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,320
so you record a small animated gif and

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,600
when the user invokes a particular

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
functionality

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
uh you could you could open up this

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,080
window

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,720
so that the animated gifs keeps playing

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,440
and the users can use that as a

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,640
reference

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,520
to sort of navigate in your ui

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,200
you could keep that optional as well uh

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,440
you know you could ask the user

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
that do you want to see an animated gif

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,400
so you know it's

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
it's totally up to you how you would

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,760
want to do it but you could use animated

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,039
gifs to sort of guide your users as well

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,440
tool tips you know you have any

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,679
on-boarding artifact toolbit tooltips

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
are a must-have because they

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,679
are the best guidance that you can

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,240
provide for the users

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,679
and if you use product tools if you use

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
the applications listed

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,960
uh you could link videos documentation

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,080
everything

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,080
in that product or

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,919
so the third artifact that we're gonna

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,039
look at

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,159
is task list so nowadays if you see

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,360
every time you login login to a new

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
application

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,559
they have a getting started short list

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,600
so these are list of tasks which

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,000
which you are expected to complete so

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,039
that

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,679
you better understand the product

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,640
and as you complete that you can see you

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,080
you get a check

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,240
mark and you get a percentage so this is

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,799
nothing but a list of tasks

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
which at the back end is actually linked

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,640
to your

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:58,400
existing functionality so let's look at

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,919
how we can use task lists

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
so these are tasks that you list

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
sequentially the hope is that the user

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,280
would

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,679
follow those tasks in a particular

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,679
sequence but not necessary

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
so you keep them in a sequence but they

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,039
should not be like

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,640
interdependent on each other the user

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,159
should have the flexibility of beginning

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,159
with whichever task they want

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,559
so what we are trying to do by creating

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,600
a task list is sort of

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,440
giving the users a direction as to how

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,840
to use the product

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,640
you're trying to show them the best way

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,039
of using your product

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:40,559
since these um you are expected to

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,760
since you are expected to um

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,200
you you expect the users to use these

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,679
two to run these tasks run through these

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
tasks

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,120
as soon as they uh log into your

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
software

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,919
don't keep them very complex keep them

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,159
simple

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
and show completion status because you

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,400
know as

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,760
as humans we we love to see a tick mark

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
and a hundred percent

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,080
so use that as a motivation for the

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,039
users to complete the tasks

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,240
um give them small rewards you know for

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,840
completion of tasks

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,600
need not be something big you know an

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,799
applause or a balloon or a clap also

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,440
makes us happy

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,039
so just keep them motivated so that they

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,120
they complete that task list

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,400
because then it will help them

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,760
understand the product

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,120
better and as with all

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,360
onboarding artifacts you know

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,760
you should be able to just cross and not

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,919
not not worry about the task list

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,360
so onboarding artifacts you got to take

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,279
it with a pinch of salt

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,760
sometimes the user may or may not use it

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,720
but when they need help you have to be

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
around

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,039
so so that's that's like your health

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
documentation as well so they might not

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,600
go and

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,960
read it every day but when they need

00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,200
help they go to your documentation

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,320
so what can you do after you go back um

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,279
you could use uh counters in your

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,679
installers

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,919
and login screens um

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,840
because then it gives an idea as to how

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,640
much how much time more

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,240
you know do i need to invest to actually

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,760
finish the installation so if i want to

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,200
go for lunch do i wait for the

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,039
installation to get over

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,240
or i come back and do it so it kind of

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,600
helps the user

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,200
make their mind task list

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,640
good to have because it's going to give

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
the users a direction

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,919
and it's easy to create because you

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
already have your existing functionality

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,320
you just need to figure out

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,520
what needs to go into the task list um

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,360
progress bars

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,080
you could use to either track the

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,360
completion rate of your task list

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,240
or if you have um if you want the users

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,559
to give them

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
to give you more information about uh

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,960
themselves their profile

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,400
you could you could use those uh you

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,960
could use the attract

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
trackpads to track those details as

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,640
linkedin does it says

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,240
your profile is 50 complete so you know

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,559
sort of motivate the users

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,159
so numbers always motivate us so you use

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,159
it to an advantage

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,000
and as always videos and documentation

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,159
is something you can always add

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,360
so in short what can a simple onboarding

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,440
example look like

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
so you have a welcome screen you split

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,240
them by personal say

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,360
admin and end user and say i click admin

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,720
task

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,720
admin um so for an admin you have a

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,559
task list ready wherein you have four or

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,679
five tasks which you expect them to

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,880
complete

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,880
and uh and you can link uh

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,400
actually you can actually you create

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,320
product tours

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,360
and list them as tasks or you could use

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,440
tooltips to guide the user so if that's

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,440
too confusing just create a task list

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
let's look at some other onboarding

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
artifacts that are available

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,919
so you can you if you don't have

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,320
anything else

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,799
you could use overlays so i'm sure all

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,960
of us have seen this sort of an overlay

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,559
so it's like a transparent screen on top

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,880
of your application

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,480
and the overlay is going to just point

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,400
arrows to the various

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,000
uh commands or functionality that's

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,520
available uh

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
in your user interface tool tips

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,520
as i said your best friends so always

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,559
always have them

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,120
uh hot spots are these this

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,840
spot that keeps flashing so wherever you

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
want to get

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,120
user attention you could use this um

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,039
you could also use this to indicate a

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,480
new feature in your ui because

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,840
that sort of gets lost and uh

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,840
you you write it in your health

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,919
documentation but you know

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,919
the user needs to see the icon match it

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,760
in the ui and then understand hey

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
this is something new so instead of that

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,760
you could use a hotspot

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,880
to indicate new features or new

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,240
functionality

00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,120
in your application and

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,960
in the app in the app messaging is

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,000
something that we already see

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,080
a lot of upgrade related information or

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
updates are pushed by various

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,520
organizations with this

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
with these with the pop-up windows that

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,520
you see coming up uh

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
in your application saying that hey the

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,760
product has been upgraded

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
we don't support this java so those sort

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,240
of

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:27,200
messages could be sent by uh

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,200
in-app messaging

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,039
so we have been looking at um

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,080
how to onboard the user within the

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,399
application

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,360
let's see how we can do it outside the

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,279
application

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,760
so as i said this is going to be more

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,919
text based

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,760
so you could use your promotional and

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,399
triggered emails to

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,679
um to help your users understand your

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,120
product better

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
so what are triggered emails so

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,440
triggered emails are emails that are

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,039
triggered because of a user action

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,640
so say i have subscribed to your

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,640
newsletter um

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,320
so the triggered email would be and

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,480
welcome email that comes to my mailbox

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,840
so in your promotional and triggered

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,279
emails have your

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,880
customer testimonials some use cases

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,480
so that it it helps your could be users

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,799
or your prospective users

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
understand how your product is going to

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,720
help solve

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,159
their business problems all

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,600
organizations send out

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,960
uh product release emails so uh

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,240
list what's new in the release um

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,320
give information um be elaborate

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,240
don't expect them to go back and see

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
your help documentation because

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,120
sometimes

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,240
users make a decision based on you know

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,480
based on one artifact sometimes um

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
and if you have link if you have created

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,200
videos or tutorials

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
for those new help features try to add

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,520
them

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,840
in your in your product release emails

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,799
because then every all the information

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,760
related to that

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,080
release is available at one place uh say

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,799
for the sales manager or the cto to sort

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,159
of see

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:12,559
see everything in one place

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,440
help topics help help documentation is

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,799
used as

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,039
pre-sales for pre-sales research so if

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,760
an

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,720
organization is trying to decide which

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,120
product to use

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,919
or which product to invest in they're

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,279
going to look at

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,760
everything that's available in the

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,240
market so then say there are 10 products

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,480
so it's humanly impossible to download

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,279
10 products and see what features are

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,440
available

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,799
right so which is the easiest place

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,640
where you're going to see a list of all

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,799
the features that are available

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
of course the health documentation so

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,799
ensure that you put in

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,720
a little bit of thought and effort in

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,880
your head documentation because that's

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,840
also something that's going to help you

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
sell your product

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,919
and and a pointer is from

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
from all of these uh external onboarding

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,640
artifacts

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,559
have a call to action button to your

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,240
download page because

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,000
you know maybe the user would be

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,840
motivated to at least look at

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,840
your trial version

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,880
and this is my last slide so um as from

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,679
this we're going to look at

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
the shelf life of onboarding artifacts

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,200
so

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,320
um they're going to be some permanent

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
artifacts like

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,360
your tooltips are not going to change um

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,640
if you have a getting started tour

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,320
unless you have added

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,320
something really important or

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,440
something that you want to showcase your

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,799
getting started

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,320
tour is more or less set um your basic

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,399
task list

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,240
more or less is not going to change so

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,440
these could be some of your

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,960
uh permanent deliverables

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,080
now based on your product adoption rate

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,880
based on your support analytics

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,919
you may you can change uh certain

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,039
existing uh

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,519
onboarding artifacts say for example

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,640
productors so if you have if your

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,039
product adoption

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,360
rate is pretty quick so release on

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,640
release you can create product doors

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,919
for new features and remove the uh

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,399
product doors of the previous releases

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,679
um but say your product adoption rate is

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,799
a little slower

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,799
so you cannot remove all the product

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,600
doors from the previous releases

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,360
you may want to retain some important

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,000
ones

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,000
so it's your product um you know your

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,120
end users

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,480
based on that decide where

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,440
what artifacts fits best what content

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,519
fits best so if you think that you can

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,240
onboard or guide your users with

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,399
tooltips

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,399
then just do it with tooltips if you

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,360
think that an additional window with an

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,840
animated gif

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,240
is going to help the user think if that

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,480
you know you could add in there

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,000
can you categorize or make it easier for

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,760
the users to choose between

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
different categories can you create a

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,840
window with

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,320
with different category options makes it

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,000
easier for the users to choose

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,600
so give it a thought i'm sure by now you

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,440
would have realized that

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,840
user onboarding cannot be an

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,919
afterthought so you will have to start

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,080
thinking about user onboarding

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,600
uh when you start doing your product

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,960
documentation

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,679
so i hope that you know you

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,200
you have some ideas about what you can

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,880
do after you go back

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,640
um these are some of the references um

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,080

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,039
