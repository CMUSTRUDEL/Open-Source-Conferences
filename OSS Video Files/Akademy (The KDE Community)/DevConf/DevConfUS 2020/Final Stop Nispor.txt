To simplify network configuration of Linux hosts, Nmstate provides a declarative method to manage network interfaces, routes and DNS configuration. By also reporting the current network state in the same format used for configuration, the configuration of one host can easily be transferred to another. Additionally, it allows to check the compliance of a host with the intended configuration. For this, it is important to gather the actual runtime/kernel networking configuration instead of the on-disk configuration that might not be applied properly.

On our journey to query the interface runtime status with Nmstate,
NetworkManager and Nispor we faced multiple problems. From on-disk profiles to sysfs to netlink. How is Nispor trying to solve this and how can other projects benefit from this solution using varlink?
