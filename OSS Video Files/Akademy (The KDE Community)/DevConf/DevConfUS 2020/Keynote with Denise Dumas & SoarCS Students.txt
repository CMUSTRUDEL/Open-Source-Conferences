00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,160
hello everyone welcome to the last day

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,079
of deathconfus

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,600
we have another set of amazing talks

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
lined up for you today

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,600
but first let's start off the day with a

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
fantastic e-note by denise dumas

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
denise started her career in the field

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
and role completely unrelated to tech

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
but quickly found herself pivoting

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
towards the industry

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,360
after a number of years as an engineer

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
denise ended up leading royal

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
engineering at red hat

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,320
and did so with resounding success

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,239
denise has won

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,479
three cv awards in addition to a

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
lifetime achievement award

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,320
not satisfied with just leading

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,000
engineering denise has recently

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
transitioned to vp for engineering

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
diversity

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,759
to spearhead efforts for improving

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,320
inclusion in the open source world

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,640
and let me tell you this no one is more

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,960
perfect than her for this role

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,920
i remember my first week as an intern at

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,880
red hat where i got to meet denise

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,799
my mind was blown by the fact that a vp

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
who was responsible for leading the

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,320
engineering efforts of the entire rail

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
organization

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
which is at least 500 engineers if not

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
more

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
was meeting an intern who was just in

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,399
her first week at red hat

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,799
moreover she was super kind and the

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,520
calming aura that emanated from her

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,000
helped me settle in she truly made me

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,079
believe that i belonged in technology

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
and i know for a fact that she's had

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,000
similar inspiring effects

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
for many other engineers throughout her

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,520
career

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
so without further ado let's put our

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
hands together for denise dumas

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,360
take it away denise thank you

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,920
so much for that wonderful introduction

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,520
and yes you truly do belong in

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
technology

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
blows my mind that you could even doubt

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,239
it for a moment

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
um so i wanted to talk with you all

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
today

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
about

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:37,840
what i've been doing for the last year

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
and it's it's really um

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,400
it's really a topic that's dear to my

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,040
heart

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,160
open source communities have relied on

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,239
talented people

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,400
to volunteer their time and their energy

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
as well as people sponsored by companies

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,160
like red hat

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,000
but look look at all of you you

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,239
certainly have other things that you

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,519
could be doing with your time

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,120
but here you are and if we want open

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,000
source communities to grow

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
and thrive we need them to attract

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
members from the whole

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,080
big messy diverse human pool of

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,200
available talent

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,480
not just one segment of it but

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,920
how to do that my job

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,920
at red hat today is to be a champion for

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,200
diversity in engineering

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,920
and it's a dream job for me after

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,959
a long career as a software engineer and

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,000
an engineering manager

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,720
but along the way i've received a lot of

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,920
lessons

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,040
about bubbles and developing

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,519
empathy and diversity

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,640
and i wanted to share my continuing

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,599
education with you

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
putting this talk together made me

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
realize how

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,959
fortunate i was that technology

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,560
the jobs that i've had that introduced

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,920
me to people who i would

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,319
never have encountered otherwise

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,519
from the very start of my career they

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,280
pushed me

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,799
way outside my original insular bubble

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,079
at an impressionable age i was just

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,040
lucky

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
but if this talk goes well i'm going to

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,479
inspire you all

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,960
to be more deliberate about expanding

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,280
your bubbles

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,120
first let's take a look at the problem

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
space

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
here are some figures around just

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,000
women's open source participation

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,880
i use women as the example here because

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
we have the most

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
data about the participation of women

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,800
globally in open

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
source a lot of women who want to

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
participate

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,639
decide not to because of unwelcoming

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
behavior

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,840
how sad is that right and we have even

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,759
less black and latin

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,800
representation especially in the us than

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,479
we have in women's

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,240
women's representation many women who

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
want to participate decide that it's

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,840
just too much hassle

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,240
they even adopt names to hide their

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,000
identity

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,919
these numbers are particularly

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
interesting to me because

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,039
according to the u.s bureau of labor

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
statistics

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,800
22.6 of professional programmers

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,720
are female but clearly

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
if that number is three percent four

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
percent for open source

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,720
open source is missing a lot of

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,280
opportunity

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,000
imagine the talent and the ideas that

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,639
we're not tapping into

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
so there are five characteristics that

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,600
are generally agreed upon

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,160
to define genius

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,600
curiosity intelligence

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,720
perseverance productivity

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,120
and most interesting to me

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,919
good luck how can open source be

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
the lucky break that some undiscovered

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,880
genius needs

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,479
because genius may not look exactly like

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,840
what our knee-jerk reaction

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,960
says real talent has never been

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,960
in big supply and it can be easily

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,039
overlooked if it doesn't fit popular

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
stereotypes

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,400
how can we get beyond the barriers to

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,199
entry

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,840
beyond the idea that open source is not

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,280
welcoming to diversity

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,680
and find the hidden talent all over the

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
world

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,360
let's think about humans in groups

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,960
anthropological studies suggest that

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
human social networks

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,479
are limited in size probably because

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
of our neocortical volume our brains

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,680
just aren't

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,240
big enough to hold all that many

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,199
connections

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
you've probably seen figures like this

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,400
um

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,599
this is showing what are called dunbar

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,319
numbers and

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,880
a lot of the social networks um a lot of

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,440
the work behind things like facebook

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,039
it's all based on on this kind of

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,840
sociological study

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,400
the number numbers try to explain the

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,680
limits

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,639
of our ability to connect closely

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,960
and how that expands up as connections

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,919
get weaker

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,840
in your closest circle you're probably

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,639
pretty uniform

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,080
our strongest ties are in worlds where

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,800
that we already know

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,520
to people very much like ourselves who

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
probably

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,280
know many of the same people that we

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,479
know

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,599
weak ties to acquaintances

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,039
to friends of a friend they connect us

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,520
outside of our core network they're less

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,840
like us but there are more of them

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,879
and they act as our bridges into other

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
networks where

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,360
the world view might look totally

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,840
different

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,160
within our bubbles we have a circle of

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,120
trust

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,720
we assume good intent right we we

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,080
believe that the intentions

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,560
of the people closest to us are not to

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,560
hurt us

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
to live in a bubble can mean to be

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,000
immersed

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,720
in an environment that gets isolated

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,680
from external reality

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,159
we each have our own experiences which

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,959
form

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,000
our own reality but we tend to be more

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,680
intimate

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
with people who've had similar

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,640
experiences

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,440
we just understand each other faster

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
and more easily because of all that we

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
have in common

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,240
they're in the same bubble and you know

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
bubble it's

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,279
an overworked but a useful metaphor

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,279
and especially in these days of covid

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
it becomes easier to see the bubbles

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
around us right the bubbles are the

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,279
people that you tend to meet with

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
face to face

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
looking outside of our bubble beyond our

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
bubble

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,080
can allow us to see things from a

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,040
previously unknown perspective

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,800
our weak ties help us create connections

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,080
outside our bubbles

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,040
to other bubbles that make us aware of

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,560
and open up to alternative points of

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,200
view

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,360
the people that we meet as acquaintances

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,680
are weak ties

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
they're vouched for by our stronger ties

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
but they

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,440
also connect us into other worlds if we

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
let them

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,440
our worlds are independent and yet

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,360
connected

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,680
and when we meet others who might be

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
very different from us

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
someone in a different bubble a

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
connection into another world

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,080
if we're open and we're curious

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,080
we can develop empathy

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,079
so why do our social circles our bubbles

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,079
matter

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,200
travel with me now to the 1980s

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,640
going for a run take your music along on

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
this handy walkman

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,079
you can mix your own playlist on

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,360
cassette tapes

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,120
so much better than eight track mobile

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,000
phone

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,920
for some values of mobile except that

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
what this picture doesn't show is the

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,800
backpack sized bag of batteries that

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,440
went along with this baby

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
nice wired mouse on the mac that slot on

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
the front that's a floppy drive

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,880
basic programming was just becoming

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,160
available for the masses

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,240
technology was strictly proprietary

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,079
open source did not exist it was not a

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,600
thing

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,760
linux didn't exist probably most of you

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,760
didn't exist

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,880
i was a very junior software engineer

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,360
living in a cube farm inside a huge

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
company

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,800
this picture is scary i bet you're all

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
looking at this picture in horror

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,120
with visions of being trapped and

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,519
bored to death and slowly morphing into

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,360
a cube zombie

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,959
but appearances to the contrary

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,640
office life only looked bland

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:37,680
in those early days the technology field

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,079
it was booming and a growing field

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,000
needs everybody that it can attract

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,880
right it needs talent

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,880
and it can't afford to be too picky

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
about the way in which the brains are

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,760
packaged

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,320
especially in these early days

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,680
stereotypes had not set in

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:02,000
and people decided um people hadn't

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,639
decided that engineering was a man's job

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,480
i worked with lots of women um some of

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,639
them were very senior

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,839
one of them in fact was in charge of the

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
whole operating system

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,959
a lot of women just like to code

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,200
we were the norm we were hired because

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,360
we displayed the aptitude

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
and the intelligence and skills that

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
were needed

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,959
diversity wasn't a thing either it was

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,639
a surprisingly welcoming environment

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
and we told our friends about it and

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,360
invited them in

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,440
in 1987 37

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,720
of the college grads with computer

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,560
science majors

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,680
were female 30 years later

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,279
in the us that number had dropped to

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,000
like maybe 15 percent

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,279
but that's just the u.s number in other

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,639
parts of the world

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
like india or romania the numbers are

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,560
much higher

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,519
even now doesn't that make you wonder

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,959
about the ways that cultural stereotypes

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,519
our biases

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,240
affect our decisions about what are or

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
are not

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,399
good jobs for me and about how different

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,800
cultures have different stereotypes

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
i hate it when people confuse previous

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,320
experience

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,320
with aptitude

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,560
so although this was the 80s

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,120
the diversity mix wasn't limited to just

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
females

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
i was young i was a little slow i worked

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
with don

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,639
a transgender colleague for quite a

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,839
while before i realized just how much

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,880
physical change

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,440
she had undergone and that our office

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,639
mates

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,240
once knew her as donald

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,639
seeing others day after day as they went

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
through

00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:02,880
transitions believe me

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,920
in the 1980s that was radical

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,279
and they were brave and

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,959
sometimes a little rowdy because

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,680
imagine how gutsy you need to be

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
the first time you put on your pretty

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
new

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,199
pair of high heels and wear them into

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
work

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,480
in this office

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:32,079
i shared a cube for a while with tom

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,720
thomas a big scary dude

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,480
he was older he was a more senior

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,040
engineer

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,120
he always wore these black leather pants

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,839
with silver studs down the side

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,959
he was definitely intimidating

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,560
and his heart was broken because his

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,720
partner had died of aids

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,440
tears started coming down his face one

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,199
day as he was sitting there next to me

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,480
in the cube we were just debugging

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:06,800
something and

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:11,199
for all the tough exterior

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,560
suddenly he looked very different to me

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,320
and in fact ever since that time

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
everybody in black leather pants with

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
silver studs downsides looks different

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,839
to me

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,360
so thank you don and tom dave

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,079
and hollis and all of you who opened my

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
eyes to

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,320
another reality who shared your world

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
views when

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,600
i was a junior engineer because you

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,880
changed me for the better

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:45,600
i learned to be able to see you all as

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:49,360
individuals the technology industry

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,079
is not perfect it was not perfect but

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,839
it's still a whole lot more accepting

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
than anything else that i've seen

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,600
open source has been international from

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,839
the very beginning

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,079
but it was mostly the us and western

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,079
europe

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
english has always been the language of

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,519
the internet

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,839
but even among these u.s and western

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,639
european nationalities

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,680
which have a lot more in common than say

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,600
i don't know u.s and congo

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,959
there are style differences that can

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,160
lead to misunderstandings

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,079
my husband who is an american

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
has been studying german for more than

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,920
five years

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,680
but even with his enormous collection of

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,000
books with titles like

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,959
understanding german culture and the

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
german people

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,240
and how to do business with germans you

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,519
know there's probably like a stack of

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,720
them behind me

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
he still relies on his german friends to

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
help

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,560
interpret subtleties areas like

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
how do you give somebody a sincere

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,759
compliment

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
what's acceptable behavior how do you

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,280
not

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,600
offend it's complicated

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,120
and most people try to give you credit

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,880
for good intentions

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,640
even if you don't get the details quite

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,559
right

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,559
but it really helps to just ask

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,880
over 30 years of managing multinational

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,360
teams

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,120
i've learned that standards differ for

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,720
formality

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,280
for humor for directness

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
for the amount of eye contact that feels

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,679
comfortable for

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,080
people for handshaking standards

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,320
even for smiling you know americans we

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,360
always smile too much right

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,000
um especially for hugging and that's

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,360
that's very different but what's funny

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,559
to me

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,039
is that idioms often translate across

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,039
cultures

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,960
actions speak louder than words

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,000
 doesn't cook rice mucho riro

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,919
e puccas noises which literally

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
translates as all talk and no walnuts

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,160
different cultures have some of the same

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,880
at least fundamental ideas

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,520
human nature is the same that you know

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
that some

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,480
ideas underpin many cultures but open

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
source communities are seeing

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,400
more and more participation from all

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,600
around the world

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,880
south america especially brazil

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:35,360
from china from eastern europe

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,240
from africa india and pakistan

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,160
the middle east and israel how do we

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,039
manage to understand each other

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,799
enough to work together across cultural

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,880
differences that can be so profound

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,760
here's a place where open source

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,799
projects are already hitting diversity

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,679
head on and if our software

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,400
is going to work around the world we

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,720
have to

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,679
understand and respect local conditions

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,840
just like my husband needs local help to

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,600
understand german idiom

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,240
we all need to act as each other's

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,640
trusted advisors our windows into other

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,880
cultures

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:22,000
here's a sad story a technical recruiter

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,360
once confessed that he was so

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,840
ashamed and afraid and embarrassed

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,480
about pronouncing a job candidate's name

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,559
incorrectly

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,919
he just stopped bringing in people with

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,000
unfamiliar names

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,120
for interviews so he'd never be in that

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,120
spot again

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,559
what if we had a culture where it was

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,840
just the norm

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,960
to begin a relationship by asking how do

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,480
you say your name correctly

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,000
even if the name is bob

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,000
we set a cultural standard

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,400
you probably have some ideas by now

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,520
about what my bubble was like back in

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,880
the day

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,880
but here's a little more because

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,760
i don't think i'm all that unusual for

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,320
my demographic

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,400
i worked my way through a state college

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,400
while living at home

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,280
which tells you what my family's

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,720
economic situation was like

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,559
and at this state college the biggest

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,039
problem was finding parking

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,559
it was mostly a commuter school and

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,159
everybody who attended was

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,880
pretty much the same trying to be

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,960
a poorly mobile many of us were the

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,720
first in our families to ever attend

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,280
college

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,960
we had very little by way of economic

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,159
safety net

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,640
and i knew that i had to work smarter

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,919
unless i wanted to be a waitress on my

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,440
life

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
and i was tired of being a waitress

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
i ended up in programming because it

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
looked like

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,720
a great economic opportunity

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
i hated my first job out of college and

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,320
i left it for

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,120
a year-long intensive program that

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,039
taught me how to code

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,320
aptitude right not previous experience

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,240
fortunately for me i also fell in love

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,440
with the technology

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,760
my career has been a joy not a grind

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,840
i discovered something that absolutely

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,520
suited me

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,880
so that was my reality but what's your

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,600
reality like

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,840
because we're all living in bubbles that

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
shape our world view

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
you've met some of the people that

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,559
enlarged my bubble

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,360
and how lucky i was right to land in a

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,280
place where people outside my circle

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
gave me a chance to get to know them as

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,000
individuals

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,919
and showed me that after all we're all

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,600
just people

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,000
our bubbles overlapped because of our

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
jobs and we had a chance to see each

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,080
other as

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,600
individuals instead of stereotypes

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,360
it was a lesson i've never forgotten and

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,799
i'm sure that there was discrimination

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,520
and i saw some people

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,039
torment themselves trying to fit into a

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
mold

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
but generally technology was a welcoming

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,640
place

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,559
in the 80s for different people

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,159
but where are you going to meet someone

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,440
different from you

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,240
who can bridge you into another world

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,000
maybe for you it's an older person like

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
me

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,919
by now i've shared enough that you

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,280
probably understand a little more about

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,320
where i come from maybe it's a black

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
person

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,320
or someone from a different country or a

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,960
different religion

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,320
or any religion at all or different

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,200
social economic circumstances right

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,360
can you step out of your own shoes and

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,159
try to experience the world from someone

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,159
else's shoes

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,120
first you have to develop empathy

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,760
and then you get to decide what you're

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,159
going to do with it

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,760
my joy in technology and along with that

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,159
the ability to support yourself

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,600
that's what i want to share today with

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,080
disadvantaged kids

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,960
with poor smart kids from whatever

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,919
background

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,000
every background who are motivated to

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,880
improve their lives

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,080
but what about you how are you going to

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
develop empathy

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,600
and then what are you going to do with

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
it

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,000
what can you do in your everyday life

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,080
to make the world of open source a

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,679
better place

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,000
remember top cooks no rice

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,640
it's not about what you say it's about

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
what you do

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,240
understand your biases and your bubble

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,760
catch yourself in that split second

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,600
between what you think and what you do

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,520
or what you say and ask yourself

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,799
what stereotype is driving that

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,840
response maybe our

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
reaction is knee-jerk but we get a

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,159
choice

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,159
about what we do with it

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,279
choose well

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,400
go be a mentor for outreachy or similar

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
internships that

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,000
are aimed at bringing a little more

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,120
diversity into the world of open source

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,279
into great open source projects

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,799
it's a great way to meet people who are

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
not like you

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,400
and who knows you might find that you

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,559
have a lot more in common than you think

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,559
i've met some great outreachy interns

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,720
help people feel comfortable that

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,480
they're not

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,679
the only one in the project

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,080
most of us are introverts who don't want

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,159
to stand out in the crowd

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,559
it's a little scary to be the only one

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,559
maybe show group pictures on your

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,720
website for your project

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,559
that includes community representatives

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,840
who might be from different cultures or

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,159
ages or genders

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,320
or races if they're comfortable having

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:32,159
their picture up

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:36,240
is there somebody here who looks like me

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,240
do i have a bridge into this world

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,360
befriend new contributors you never know

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,559
who you might meet

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,559
and what you might learn from them

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,679
provide on-ramp tasks that are suitable

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,840
for newbies

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,760
help people find them let them

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,520
contribute and coach them

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,799
on how to do it gently

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,080
and then remember to praise somebody

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,480
who contributes something useful a lot

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,840
of us

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:09,039
aren't very confident and encouragement

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,279
is valuable and really reinforcing

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,840
if you say thank you to somebody they're

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,440
more likely to come back

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
remember the last time that somebody

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,799
told you that they appreciated something

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,440
that you had done

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,440
that your work was valuable it just

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,039
feels good

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,760
review patches from the perspective of

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,120
does it work and not from the

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,880
perspective of

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,679
is it the way i would have written it

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,679
this insight comes from a session at the

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,960
last devconf in brno

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,480
face-to-face i missed that when several

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
guys were discussing

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,559
what patches from people with names they

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,360
were discussing the fact that patches

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,440
from people with names that sound female

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,640
generate a lot more trivial comments

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,880
than those

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:04,080
from people with names that sound male

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
and they ask themselves why would i do

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,919
that why

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,840
am i doing that and they realized that

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,440
what they were really commenting on is

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
that's not the way i would have written

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,880
it

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,000
but it still works so thank you niels

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
and company

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,600
for bringing that perspective to the

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
issue i think you nailed it

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,080
lastly call out bad behavior when you

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,080
see it

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,200
we don't do that here

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:43,120
that establishes a really powerful

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,120
cultural norm we don't do that here

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,559
the open source community that i know

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,360
best is fedora

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,720
and i've always loved that part of the

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,760
fedora motto

00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,760
is friends freedom

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,760
friends features first

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,480
inclusive and innovative go together

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,760
and i want open source projects and the

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,880
open source ethic

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,760
to grow and thrive in short

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,399
i want open source to be a place where a

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,279
diverse

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,360
mix of people all backgrounds all

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,279
cultures all races all genders

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,760
all ages want to come and stay

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
and bring their best ideas do their best

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,919
work

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,240
in open source and if we do it right

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,600
they're gonna show up we're gonna find

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,799
them

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,360
and they're gonna bring their friends

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,840
so thank you for listening to me and

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,320
enjoy

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,120
devconf i hope you make a lot of new

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
friends here today

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
thank you so much

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,799
thank you so much denise for that that

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,240
was a playing

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,919
talk i never thought about my bubble

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,200
versus your bubble

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,880
um but that was those great uh i would

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,799
like to point out that

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,799
i was very lucky to be surrounded by

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,399
amazing people here who invited me to

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,399
their bubble that helped me get out of

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,039
my shell because i was that introvert

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,679
anxious intern and now i'm here being a

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,640
co-chair

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,039
of a conference so thank you so much for

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
that

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,399
inspiring talk and i know look at the

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,799
potential that we found in you

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,760
yeah yes and i know you're going to

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,240
continue inspiring

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,480
many more engineers in the future thank

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,919
you so much

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,840
thank you everyone yeah um

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:55,840
i'm going to pass it on to langdon now

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:55,840
for our next segment

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,600
or you're going to try because

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,000
technology decided to fail at the best

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
possible

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,480
time uh so i'm going to

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,600
share some slides again thank you so

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,039
much for that talk

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,080
um and avashi's great intro

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,520
um so

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,760
there's always the hunt for the uh

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,000
the correct uh link to uh share

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,600
and here we go so one of the things we

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,520
like to do at devconfus

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,880
every year is we like to highlight uh

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,039
some of the

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,520
students uh you know so in the us if

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,919
you're not an american

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,200
internships are almost always in the

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,279
summer time

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,520
with some exceptions for some

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,880
universities and even some high schools

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
um but for the most part they're almost

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
always in the summer time as devconfus

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,840
is always kind of right after the summer

00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,000
time uh we like to try to highlight uh

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,360
you know some of the work that was done

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,640
um that we

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,799
generally speaking we're involved in

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,919
that's red hat um

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,679
and so that's what this uh bit is about

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:15,360
um and so what we have

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:19,039
today is uh you know we have

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,080
um you know a really large like kind of

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,240
internship program

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,600
globally we also try to be really

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
involved in in uh

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,640
universities and schools and stuff in

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,159
general um

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,399
you know and just uh just kind of off

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,679
the top of our head what we are aware of

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,640
is that we teach actual classes at umass

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,159
lowell

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,039
which is a state school in massachusetts

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,679
and boston university which is a school

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,279
in

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,880
boston and then northeastern another

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,720
school in boston um

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
and we probably actually teach at a

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,880
whole bunch of other universities

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,640
um but it's uh it can be a little

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,720
challenging to keep track of it because

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,240
as a rule right red headers tend to be

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,279
uh

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,360
really like to give back uh and so

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,799
you know if uh if they don't see a

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,240
program that they can do that with

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,279
uh internally they just run with it um

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,480
so this year we had uh kind of just

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,360
in in the kind of the boston area uh 142

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,080
interns

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,159
um and what we are most proud of is even

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,320
with the kind of kovitz scenario

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,760
we we didn't we weren't forced to cancel

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,679
a lot of internships

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,679
and that was really tough and you know

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,000
props to all of the mentors

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,279
and all of the like kind of recruiting

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
folks and you know all the people

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,159
involved in you know typical hr

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,080
uh for supporting that function uh

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,240
because being able to do that remotely

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,519
is really challenging and also you know

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,240
props to the students too

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,880
because like doing an internship

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,880
remotely

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,919
like i i can't even imagine that's just

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,159
kind of crazy

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,000
um we also do uh some other programs

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,000
that are like the engineering residence

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,559
that we have over at boston university

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,240
uh which is something i did um and is

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,240
something we try to support

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,000
so that basically we have uh you know

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,360
kind of someone who has been in the

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,360
software development world

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,200
is available to students uh so that they

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,519
can kind of come and ask about what it

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,679
might

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,840
be like to work in software development

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,840
so and kind of moving on sorry we also

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,320
oh and then sorry i forgot uh one which

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,720
is we

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,640
tend to also teach a lot of workshops at

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,720
various levels

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,720
both high school and the university

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,440
specifically i'm aware of a lot of ones

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,640
by

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,720
the user experience folks they do design

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,480
and ideation and then even refinement

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,120
workshops for students who are thinking

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,240
about projects

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,399
they want to do and

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,519
we also try to support students at dev

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,399
conf itself so

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,200
like we had a number of students um

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,760
speaking

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,360
uh yesterday and a number speaking today

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,760
uh so one of the things we do

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,039
is we actually have an intern intern

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,039
competition

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,480
so whoever gives the best lightning talk

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,519
uh actually gets a spot

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,200
at devconf us to to give a talk um

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,960
and so you can look for them on the

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,000
schedule um you know they're

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,840
they're just as uh real

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
as any other talks there's not really a

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,879
signifier

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320
but uh you know definitely go check them

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,480
out and hear some names of some of those

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,960
speakers

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,560
and then a couple of other programs that

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,359
we are involved in

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,480
um sorry i wanted to kind of see where i

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,520
am in the slides here

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,599
um is uh so going

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,679
kind of back a slide is the red hat

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,639
laboratory bu spark this is actually the

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,720
program i'm a lot

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,919
involved in uh we're kind of supporting

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,440
students trying to do

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,599
um things in the software world

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,119
uh rather than kind of things that are

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,960
uh you know academic

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
uh although we do a lot of academic

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,399
research as well um

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,639
you know the parts spark for example

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,679
tries to look for ways for students to

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
get more involved in software

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,960
engineering

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,879
another big program that we're involved

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,399
in and specifically actually denise was

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,879
pretty heavily involved in

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,359
is the leadership academy at another

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,200
massachusetts state school umass amherst

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,800
they're all intelligently named by the

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,640
city they're in so that's obviously an

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,160
amherst

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,839
and then another program that we

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,520
supported

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,960
is the ramp program and a lot of these

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,880
you can kind of read for yourself so i

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,320
wasn't going to go into too much detail

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,839
but i know denise actually mentored

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,240
at least one or two students in this

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,880
program uh herself directly

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,800
uh but another you know and then ramp

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,400
and source all these programs right are

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,880
trying to get

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,640
um students who are underrepresented

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,079
underrepresented in the uh you know

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,760
software development world

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,040
uh you know kind of a a safer pathway

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,640
because one of the things that we see

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,079
right is that there's a lot of fall off

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,720
of students they enter in computer

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,119
science

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,760
you know as an underrepresented group um

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,880
and then they

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,960
they tend to drop it after a while so

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,040
something we can do to help with that is

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,839
is to try to support them

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
as software engineers uh and try to help

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,800
them

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,720
understand what that that world is like

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,720
uh without having to just wing it

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,920
um you know compared to uh somebody

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,839
who's you know

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,280
maybe gotten lucky and had a computer

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,640
their whole life and been programming

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
you know since they were six

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,400
uh like a good friend of mine for

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,640
example

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,440
so all these programs and then uh you

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,280
know unfortunately

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,359
because of covid normally we try to

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,359
feature a lot of students at this

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,720
um but in this particular case we are

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,640
going to feature one program

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,400
where we were able to negotiate with

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,240
class times and that kind of stuff and

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,720
actually get the students here for it

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,079
which is the source cs program and now

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,400
we're going to have

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
fred martin who is the associate dean at

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
university of

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
lowell or university of massachusetts

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,520
lowell often referred to as uml

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,599
so if you hear that that's why and it is

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,480
not a drawing language

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,680
um and so fred do you want to uh come on

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,160
and tell us a little bit about the

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,119
program

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,880
sure thanks langton um and i'm just

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,280
blown away by denise by

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,960
your talk um it was really inspiring to

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,440
me and to hear your personal story i

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,839
mean

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,000
made a big impact on me um i'm really

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,800
happy to be able to be here with you

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
today and

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,400
and linkedin you're going to introduce

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,359
our students from umass lowell

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,640
um so two years ago uh we created this

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,440
source cs program

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,440
and and red hat was one of our founding

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,680
sponsor is our fat is our founding

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,760
sponsor and you support us again

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,880
this year um this year of course we did

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,280
it virtually

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
um and just building on what denise and

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
lincoln eubal said

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
um to me this program is about giving

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,280
opportunities to students

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,680
um to to advance them in computer

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
science

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,440
support and advance them and

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,079
particularly diverse students

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,599
um so yeah so it's a summer program it's

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,119
it's called the bridge program that's

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,400
the university of parliament for a

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,640
bridge between high school and

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,640
university to really give

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,079
students a jump start on their

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,839
university careers and

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,440
um thanks for having us here linkedin

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,200
and um yeah and

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,880
and welcome to our students who are here

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,280
thank you

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,079
yeah no it's uh we're really happy to

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,800
have you it's i

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,480
i i think this is a lot of fun uh so and

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,520
i hope the audience does as well

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,640
uh so to start off with we

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,320
are going to uh this might

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,240
to be honest this might be my personal

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
favorite of the projects

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,760
um because it's near and dear to my

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
height near and dear to my heart as a

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,920
public transit user

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,880
when there's no covet um so this is uh

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,760
jaylen jones

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,880
uh and uh the project that she worked on

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,400
over the summer she's gonna tell us a

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
little bit about

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,960
hello everybody my name is jalen and uh

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,400
over the summer i got the opportunity

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,599
through sourcius to learn

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,240
a lot more about web apis and

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,240
so i worked on a project called

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,640
predicting trains using python

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,760
and web apis essentially so in

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,240
massachusetts

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,599
we have the mbta that runs communal

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,599
commuter rail lines

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,520
throughout all the neighboring cities

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,839
and i live near one of the commuter rail

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,240
lines so i'm always hearing the trains

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,359
but um i wanted to be able to actually

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,839
like predict

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,760
when i would hear a train instead of

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,160
having to like refer to the schedule and

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
flip

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,079
and look at the inbound trains and the

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,880
outbound trains it's a lot of effort

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,240
it's a lot of

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:14,880
you know flipping between tabs

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,880
so i essentially use the mbta api

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,400
to pull that information from the

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,359
schedule and then

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
have it uh predict when i would be able

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,640
to hear

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,839
a trade based on my geographic location

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,680
to the

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,200
uh to the line to the train line

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,720
and uh depending on whether it's an

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,359
inbound or an outbound train

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,200
it also like adjusts the time given on

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,839
the schedule to when i would be able to

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,839
actually hear it

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,160
um as uh you know as we've talked about

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,680
a little bit before

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,119
what i want to know is when we're going

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,720
to be able to predict when the train is

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,200
not going to come because that's really

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,800
my

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,359
pet peeve so thanks so much for that and

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
i really appreciate your time um and uh

00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,160
we'll move on

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,160
to the next uh project

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,280
and uh so this is uh brian mata

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,400
montalvan

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,119
sorry um and arthur rosa and

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,079
they worked on a project to share a bit

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,520
about lowell

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,800
itself um and uh so arthur do you want

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,640
to go ahead and

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,839
tell us a little bit about the pro of

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,000
course so

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,280
my name is arte de rosa and during the

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,119
summer we worked on a

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,200
project for um sources in this project

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,680
we wanted to learn more about low as

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,920
upcoming freshman at the time we wanted

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,400
to learn about the area and how it is

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,960
because

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,079
i live pretty far and low is a pretty

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,240
big place

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,520
compared to where i'm from so i wanted

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,319
to learn more about it

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,280
so and um in our project here we made a

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,240
website

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,520
we used some apis for our our map our

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,680
interactive map

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,960
that we learned in source us which

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,359
proved quite useful

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,119
and also we have some outside knowledge

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,920
that we didn't learn in source cs which

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,599
is

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,240
some web development like stuff like css

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,720
and html which i did not know anything

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,319
about

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,040
but brian here helped me a lot and we

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,119
were able to get through it so we added

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,640
some fun facts

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,040
uh low is like the fourth biggest city

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,319
in massachusetts which is like 14.5

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,680
miles which is

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,560
gigantic compared to my 3.5 miles from

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,680
where i am

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,960
area so and also we added some beautiful

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,160
pictures of low

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,599
and i hope i'll be able to go there

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,000
someday

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,440
even though we're all virtual i hope we

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,760
can go soon

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,680
and um it was just a great experience

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,560
overall learning and

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,240
i appreciate it all right so because it

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,280
wouldn't be a conference without some

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,440
technical difficulties

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,480
uh brian uh is unable to get his video

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,040
working but

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,720
he is going to speak to us i hope if

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,440
assuming we can get sound yes

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,000
i am i'm here all right hello everybody

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,599
my name is brian montalvan uh

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,359
so going back to what arthur really

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,880
started with we really started this

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,359
project to kind of show

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,240
our fellow source cs members a bit more

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,160
about low

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,079
because some of them aren't from low or

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,960
from around the area so we really wanted

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,599
to show them

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,880
uh what law was really about um and a

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,359
quick fact for myself

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,040
i mean a quick fact from law is that did

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,240
you know that phone numbers were first

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,599
invented in law

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,520
that is something that i didn't really

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,800
know and hopefully

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,000
something new that you guys found out

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,280
today um so the website essentially has

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,240
quick fun facts about lol um it has

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,920
we use google apis recently i added in a

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,560
carousel showing pictures of

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,920
different areas of lowell just nice

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,400
scenery around lowell

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,440
um and most of all it was just a fun and

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
enjoyable project

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
where i was able to help arthur learn

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,960
more about uh web development

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,400
at least in the front end and i think it

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,520
was very helpful for the both of us and

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,839
we're able to

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
help our cs members learn a bit more

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,760
about low

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,119
so yeah that's great that's great uh i

00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,839
have a fun fact about lowell that you

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,599
may not know

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,200
which is uh as a parent of kids with

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,839
food allergies um

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,319
the uh minor league baseball team in

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,680
lowell

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,960
has regular occurrence of uh food safe

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,920
uh or allergy friendly uh baseball games

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,280
uh obviously not so much right now being

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,319
not very pandemic safe

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,960
but uh in general and uh so uh that's

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
basically

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,640
most of the times my kids have actually

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,079
seen baseball and being an american

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,079
uh you know baseball is kind of

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,119
important um at least

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,160
you know to old people like us um so

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,520
thanks again so much

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,960
uh and uh we'll move on to our next

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,200
project thank you so uh

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,800
this project uh i think is really cool

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,440
uh but super scary

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,079
um so isabelle paban and uh minhaus

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,640
chattery

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,000
uh put this project together and i think

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,040
is bella you're gonna you're gonna go

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,040
first all right so

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,720
watch tell us a little bit about the pro

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,640
hi i'm isabella pabon

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,400
and for this project we worked with a

00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
program called meyer which was actually

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,440
created by

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
umass lowell and in meijer you use

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,400
javascript

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,079
to basically create anything you want in

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,839
vr there's tons of different functions

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,440
and shapes you can play around with

00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,880
which was really cool for men and i

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,000
because we had

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,680
never worked with javascript or vr

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,079
or anything along those lines before and

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,960
i was very new to coding source cs was

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,960
my first

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,079
really good time working with coding so

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
i had a really fun time

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,000
working with meyer we both did so we

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,640
that's pretty much why we decided to

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,880
finally go with it for our final project

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,839
and i think min is going to talk about

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,599
who did what and

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,200
why we actually decided to do nightmare

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,359
before christmas i can hear me

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,800
thank you bella so we worked on the

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,640
nightmare before christmas because we

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,240
both shared a love for the movie so we

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,359
decided to recreate one of our favorite

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,960
scenes

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,160
and this turned out to be more

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,079
interesting than i thought it would

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,000
because how we allocated the work was

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,599
while bella worked mostly on the the

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,240
scenery and the snow and the houses and

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,880
everything

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,640
i focused on the main character jack and

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,240
something we found was that while she

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,480
was really confused at how i created

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,240
jack i had no idea how she was making

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,839
these sceneries look so well

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,680
so we realized that our different skill

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,640
sets applied very differently to how we

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,599
worked in meijer

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,200
which is really cool we i think our next

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,560
step would have been to add the music

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,000
from the movie because that's honestly

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,359
the best part of the scene but we were

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,839
still learning how to do that as we went

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,839
along

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,040
thanks so much um yeah so uh one thing i

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,800
wanted to point out is

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,440
i i got to say your full names but i

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,040
noticed that uh both

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,359
each of you called the other by short

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,800
names so you know with bella and min

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,319
uh which i thought was particularly

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,599
amusing when i was stumbling over your

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,319
names yesterday

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,040
uh so thanks so much again for uh coming

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,280
on with us

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,240
uh and uh we're going to just kind of

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,000
move to the thank you

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,880
uh and uh so a little shout out to um

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,240
