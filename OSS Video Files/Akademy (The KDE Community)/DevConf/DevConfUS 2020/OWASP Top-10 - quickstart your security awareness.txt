Title: OWASP Top-10 - quickstart your security awareness
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Allon Mureinik

Not everyone is a security expert. Of course, not everyone needs to be a security expert, but in today’s world of rapid development and deployment, developers cannot afford to ignore security considerations completely, and “just leave it up to the security team to review”.

In this talk, I’ll present the OWASP Top-10 project, an (incomplete) list of the top security vulnerabilities (web) developers face. I will then talk about how developer-awareness from the ground up is a key to shifting left the way we think about security, which is the first step in creating better-secured applications.
