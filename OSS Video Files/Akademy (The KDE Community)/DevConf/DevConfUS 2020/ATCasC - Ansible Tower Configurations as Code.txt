	Speaker: Kedar Kulkarni

Everyone has heard of Red Hat Ansible, but how about Ansible Tower(or AWX- its open source counterpart)? If you donâ€™t know what it is, then this talk is for you. Tower will help you add sophistication to your Ansible usage and have visibility & control over how your team uses Ansible. While doing so, one of the things that you need to worry about is how reliable your Ansible Tower setup is? How would you maintain all the objects like Projects, Users, Settings, Credentials, Job Templates and Workflow Templates created in the ansible tower are reproducible, you can redeploy it in case you lose it. In this talk, you will see how we achieved this reproducibility in our environment.

You will walk away with knowledge of:
What is Ansible Tower and why do I need it?
Ansible Modules to interact with tower
Ansible tower Meta backup vs full backup and restore
CI Workflow for Ansible Playbook/Ansible Tower Git Repos to enable contribution from others
Use cases that can be automated via Ansible
