hello and welcome to KDAB news the monthly update for professionals working

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,120
with Qt, C++ and 3d technologies. I'm Robert Brock and today we have the

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,619
following topics. first there is an interview with KDAB CEO Kalle Dalheimer

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,210
on the recent discussion about Qt commercial and open source licenses.

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:35,880
The release of KDE plasma bigscreen an open source UI for Smart TVs, Qt for

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:45,410
MCU 1.1 release, how crowd sourced 3d printing helps support local healthcare

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,710
then finally some announcements and resources.

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,140
As you may have noticed recently there have been some rumors about Qt

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,509
company plans for commercial licenses and how that could affect the open

00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:14,520
source licenses. In order to give you some background information on this

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:23,190
process I'll be talking to Kalle Dalheimer the founder and CEO of KDAB. Hello

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,800
Kalle, thank you for being with us. There has recently been some discussion around

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,140
possible changes to Qt's licensing and development model. Can you give our

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,500
viewers some background please? Of course, Robert. So Qt was originally developed

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,679
by first Trolltech, then Nokia, then Digia and then the the Qt Company and it's being

00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:52,940
a collaborative effort almost from day one together with the community. And

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,069
KDAB have always been the most significant external contributor and the

00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,709
KD project was one of the first users of Qt at all and it's still by far the

00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:10,679
largest user of Qt. So open governance and the open source model has been a

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,030
huge success factor for Qt. Many, many hands to help many, many eyeballs to find

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:25,709
bugs, to find security holes just make for a faster evolution. And the founders

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,879
of Trolltech the original developers of Qt realized this and they had the

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,250
foresight to protect the availability of Qt for open source software by way of

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,780
the KDE free Qt foundation. So recently there have been negotiations between the

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,810
KDE free Qt foundation and the Qt Company about some changes or updates to

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,019
their mutual agreements. And these negotiations seem to have stalled and

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:03,060
gone sour. There seems to be a lot of contention between the parties. According

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,519
to a representative or two representatives from the KDE project the

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,170
Qt Company threatens to restrict the OSS versions, the open

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,750
source versions to releases that are one year delayed after the commercial

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,629
releases. I have to say so far for us this is only secondhand information but

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,010
if this is true it would mean an end to open governance which would be very

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,780
unfortunate for us as KDAB, for the Qt ecosystem and for Qt the tool and

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,980
the product itself. Yes, yeah of course. So what does this mean for the Qt

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:53,250
ecosystem and how are people impacted? Well projects like KDE, QGis a Qt based

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,870
geo information system and VLC the video lan video player all rely on prompt

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,190
updates from releases in particular of course when it comes to security fixes

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,269
but also in general. These projects are crucial for the continued growth of

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:18,209
Qt. They developers learn often Qt on while working on some open

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,550
source project and then when they later go get a a paid a time job they will

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,289
introduce Qt there so this is these projects are not just excellent test

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:34,830
beds but also a great way of disseminating knowledge about Qt into

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,080
the world. And I should also say that for us at KDAB the KDE project in

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,590
particular has always been a very important recruiting pool because we

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,849
knew there would be qualified people who knew Qt already and then there are

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:56,280
numerous contributors to Qt who provide fixes and even develop all new

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,560
features, sometimes whole new modules for Qt who are not on Qt company's payroll.

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,699
So they don't get to pay to contribute they do it for the love of

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,530
the technology and obviously because they are enthusiastic software

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:19,800
developers but of course their pay is getting their code made available to

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,670
millions of Qt users. And if this ceases

00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,690
by way of open government's not being available anymore if it takes a year for

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,830
their fixes to be made available to the general public then obviously these

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:39,720
people would have no motivation anymore to develop the Qt product for free. Yes

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,760
and other than being a key part of the recruitment process what does it mean

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,000
specifically for KDAB? Well we have to say that KDAB's loyalty

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,470
of course is with its staff and with its customers. We have a lot of Qt

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,930
contributors ourselves so the open governance process is very important for

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:11,430
our guys, for our developers. But also for our customers even though the

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:18,150
majority of our customers certainly uses the commercial version which is by at

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,180
large feature equivalent with the open-source version. They rely on Qt

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:31,590
being available on a very wide possible base. Again the more people who develop

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,990
on a tool or an environment the more the more features kept develop the more

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,120
bugs get fee fixed, the more security holes get plugged. So that's simply faster

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,400
evolution and the ecosystem itself is what many of our customers what has

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,810
attracted many of our customers to Qt in the first place. Because they see it's

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,500
not just dependent on one single legal entity that could get acquired or

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,950
disappear for other reasons, that there's this large base of developers worldwide

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,410
that moves the project ahead. And if that were to disappear then it just becomes

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,640
less attractive. and people would be looking at alternatives. Yeah and

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,990
where do you think this is going? Our business success here at KDAB of

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,140
course is very tightly coupled to Qt's business success and Qt's success in

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,700
turn is very tightly coupled to the open governance process. So we will

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,010
do whatever we can to support the

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:47,110
continued existence and livelihood of the open governance process. We're very

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,130
happy to see that the Qt company recently stated in a blog post that they

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,120
remain committed to open source software. But there is very both at KDAB and in

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,800
other communities that we are in very close contact with that things might

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,660
change for the worse. This is partly fueled by a decision made

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,410
a couple of months ago by the Qt company to make the long term service

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,380
releases not available to open source users anymore and also to make Qt

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:27,010
accounts mandatory. So that blog post in itself has not entirely removed all the

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,140
worry that there is about the future of Qt. So we can see why there are still

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,900
some seeds of doubt. What are your final thoughts? So we're confident though that

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,950
an agreement can be reached eventually between the Qt company and

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,160
the KDE free Qt foundation and that the Qt company continues to embrace

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,880
the benefits from a living ecosystem. And I should also say that as of now this

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,440
ecosystem is very much alive. Thank you very much for your time Kalle. Thank you

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:14,080
Robert. You ever wondered if your Smart TV could be spying on you and would have

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,800
liked to do something about it a few weeks ago

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,430
KDE released the base version of their KDE plasma big screen an open source UI

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:31,570
for Smart TVs it's built on top of KDE and cue technologies sharing a lot of

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:37,120
code with the plasma desktop experience yet presenting the user with a radically

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,330
different interface and input system it provides an easy-to-use interface

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,220
optimized for remote controlled usage as well as voice interaction thanks to an

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,020
optional integration with the open-source mycroft voice

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:59,520
assistant you'll find more information on plasma - big screen org which will be

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:09,090
in the description section below last week cute released a new version of cute

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,790
for MCU apart from extended documentation it brings support for five

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:22,830
new development boards from n XP and STM also it introduces a new resource system

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,920
for greater flexibility on how assets are included in your application and it

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,990
comes with tech previews of free rtos and cue charts for MC use support learn

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:44,940
more in the release linked below now for a little bit about how we can be more

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,860
helpful to the frontline medics and scientists I'm sure you've already been

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,240
reading in the news about people helping with regards to personal protection

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,700
equipment or PPE for short everyone using 3d printers to either

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,890
print face shields or mask holders I won't bore you further with news about

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,270
those events but will reiterate the importance of getting into organized

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:15,210
groups or even joining an existing group simply printing these at home and then

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,400
walking to your nearest hospital care or doctor's office will only be putting

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,760
yourself and the workers at risk as an example I joined the National 3d

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,010
printing Society what they do is make sure the STL or printing file is a

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,230
version that will be accepted further down the line there have been people

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,720
that's jumped in too quickly without looking and invest of time and money to

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,420
print thousands of face shields that couldn't be accepted so this is the

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,990
first issue you won't have to worry about

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,740
next they have organized logistics to first control the sterilization of the

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,750
printed items remember the path where I said simply dropping them off could put

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,790
to you and others at risk this gets rid of that risk by making sure it meets

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,450
proper medical requirements lastly a stuff that is also all through often

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,610
ignored they distribute them this is important because this organized handing

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:28,530
out of resources means they know who needs what and who got what so find an

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,200
organized 3d printing group near you and get printing just take the STL file and

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:42,120
print then get a nice warm fuzzy feeling inside what's that you don't have a 3d

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,070
printer and want to feel warm and fuzzy or you have one but want to feel more

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,020
warm and fuzzy right so if there is something else you can do you can fold

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,030
at home no no no not the clean clothes that have been sitting on the side for

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,460
two days so folding at home as quoted from their site is a distributed

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,670
computing project for simulating protein dynamics why is this important now well

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,740
they're using all the extra computing power we can provide to help fight

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,320
Kovach 19 you can have a look for yourself on the link below then

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,580
hopefully a quick search will also show you that a few heavy hitters have

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:32,460
already joined in the fight they're all warm and fuzzy next in our announcements

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,650
this month as we know many events have been canceled postponed or shifted to

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:45,990
virtual formats after cute world summits 2020 had been postponed to October 2020

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,330
now it's been announced that a cute virtual tech con will take place on the

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:58,850
12th and 13th of May there will be 36 live talks for designers developers and

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,959
technology managers from beginners all the way up to professionals and

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:11,089
registration is free also this year's KDE Academy will happen

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:17,420
completely virtually from September 4th to 11th participants will showcase

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,029
discuss and plan the future of the community and its technology academy

00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,430
2020 will begin with virtual training sessions on Friday 4th of September this

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,569
will be followed by a number of torque sessions held on Saturday 5th of

00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:38,750
September and Sunday 6th of September the remaining 5 days will be filled with

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:49,490
workshops and breakout sessions due to their respective evolution cute often

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,130
followed and still follows some design idioms that feel unnatural to the usual

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,630
C++ developer qdubs even footage describes some ways to work with it in

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,680
his recent article cute ranged based for loops and structured bindings check it

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,930
out below thanks again for watching stay safe and feel free to share any feedback

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:26,329
