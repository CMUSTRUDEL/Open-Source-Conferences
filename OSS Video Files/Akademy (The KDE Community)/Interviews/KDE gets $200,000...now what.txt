hello welcome to the next episode of a

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,929
TFR community if you are keeping an eye

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,010
on Linux word you might be aware of the

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,519
two hundred thousand dollar donation

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,789
temples made by the pineapple phone -

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,750
Doug Katie community no that's a decent

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,430
amount of money so do you wonder that

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,220
how is the Katie community planning to

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,880
use that money and and the bigger

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,239
question is who men is all these funds

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,590
that come to the titty committee there

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,440
is an organization behind the KD

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,570
committee is called KDB and today we are

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,820
going to talk to two amazing people from

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,540
the Katie community I have known them

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,879
forever

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,430
but interestingly I have never met them

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,950
in person and I have met a lot of kidney

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,500
people but not these two so today we are

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,770
going to talk to Lydia who is the

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,949
president of the KDE board and former

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,770
vice president Sebastian so let's make

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,390
Lydia and Sebastian so here we are we

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,650
are talking to the Katie community we

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,460
have Lydia with us and we have Sebastian

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,520
with us

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,010
before we kind of deep dive into this

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,530
interview Lydia can you please tell us a

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,390
bit about what is Katie Evie and what is

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,369
e V stands for I have lived in Germany

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:23,400
so I do know but just for our you know

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:25,799
viewers so is the organization that

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,670
supports the Katie community for example

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,270
in legal matters in financial matters

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:36,180
organizations of events and similar

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,150
things and you really sense for ainÃ­t

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:44,610
are gonna find which is shown roughly

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,640
for registered nonprofit and when you

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,740
said that you know to support the Katie

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,220
community what kind of support are we

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,460
talking about mm-hmm so for example we

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,969
are paying for the service that the code

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,960
is being developed on hosted online we

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:07,049
are helping to organize Academy or

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,440
annual event and developments friends

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,810
other contributors prints those are

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,480
among the things said DV does

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,209
and and before we talk about this you

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,590
know mysterious and magical $200,000

00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,200
donation

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,940
what kind of funding any sponsorship is

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,770
already there what kind of model do you

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,060
have to sponsor in front of the whole

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,010
project and the operation that you're

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,350
running there because KD is one of the I

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,060
think one of the oldest and also one of

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,790
the most mature and one of the biggest

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,350
you know open-source projects out there

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,640
mm-hmm

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:45,160
so KD Ivy gets its funding from a number

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,709
of different sources the one that's

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:52,930
closest to my heart is individual people

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:55,120
can be being five hero 10 euro a hundred

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,810
euro because they like our software and

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,569
they want to advance our course and make

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,640
that software available to more people

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:08,560
and another way that KD v is financed is

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,850
through the membership fees of our

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,220
patrons so those are companies that

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,480
value our cold and the work we do and

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,690
and want to support that financially and

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,500
a third thing is sponsorship of academy

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,750
our annual event so there are it's

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,239
mostly companies who want to support the

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,070
event and and the meeting of our

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,840
contributors and and allow them to work

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:41,620
together is there any kind of

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,500
participation or funding from any public

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,700
bodies like governments or local

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,470
administrations or something like that

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,980
or is all everything is totally

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:55,959
privately funded we were part of e

00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,420
research projects in the past but right

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,420
now we're not okay

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,820
that's another angle to that story

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,500
because there is hardly any direct

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,820
financial contributions by governor

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,370
governments or or nonprofits but they do

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:19,829
contribute in kind so for example if we

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,480
have the Limoges project which is the

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,090
Linux operating system grew

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,550
in the city of Munich which has switched

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,200
to open-source fully back in

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,450
contributing for I think five yes

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:40,310
actively stream by providing feedback

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:46,190
but also by by fixing things by actively

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:49,070
participating and they've also directly

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,250
or indirectly been contributing code by

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,770
fixed I paying contractors to how to do

00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:00,800
so another really good example for that

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:03,920
is the German government there's a group

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,650
under the ministry all this there's a

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,190
digital security group and they've been

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,710
funding work on email on the email

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:16,670
client on security infrastructure on

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:19,580
strong cryptography so there there's

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,410
actual participation by governmental

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:27,920
organizations but it's not in hard cash

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:30,230
okay and I don't want to kind of discuss

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,570
but the Linux Linux project we heard

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,850
that because the mayor's chained and he

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:39,140
is true Microsoft person and they are

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,730
planning to go back to so how does that

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,030
affect that project and their

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:46,880
involvement with the carry committee I'm

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,720
so far it's well there's a political

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,940
process and it's going rather slowly so

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,630
the news has reached us but the

00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:00,710
consequence in seventh so there's still

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:05,540
active contribution to upstream plasma

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:07,130
we still receive bug fixes so while on

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,210
the one hand we are actually very sad

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:17,930
for for all the politics involved which

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:20,780
well to be fishy we are still working

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,380
with them actively to actually achieve

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,020
their goals

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:28,210
so the new the rollout of the new client

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:31,999
is waiting they switching to plasma five

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,519
over the past years and

00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:36,469
this is what's actually going on behind

00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,569
the scenes when you ignore politics for

00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:44,799
a while so that's a very fruitful

00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:47,360
healthy relationship to what's ever said

00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:50,539
like the politics behind this is a shame

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,819
right well the nice thing about this is

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,249
this is not the end of all work right

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:58,039
can you spread out over so many people

00:06:55,249 --> 00:07:00,349
so many organizations that one

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,419
organization pulling out is the end of

00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:07,009
Kitty and we will continue to provide

00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,989
great support everyone right yeah yeah

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,639
that's that's a nice thing not to put

00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:14,689
all the eggs in the same basket

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,439
whatever you say well and of course

00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:20,809
another really interesting angle is the

00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,059
work that has been done as part of as

00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:27,349
part of the project isn't lost it's

00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:30,849
actually benefiting the the general

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:33,679
public because it doesn't end up in some

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:37,459
proprietary code base that's never going

00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:40,069
to be used again it is available for for

00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,509
all users and in fact that's one of five

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,039
point twelve which has just been

00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,779
released contains a whole number of

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,569
improvements that have been directly

00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:54,129
sponsored by the Emacs projects folks

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:57,050
what is been a support for all of you

00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:59,569
right yeah the way I see that you know

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,249
you there are two ways to contribute to

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,529
any open source project either cash or

00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:04,909
code so either you are contributing

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,279
through code or you are going to cash

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,189
and that's what mostly happens that is

00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:15,229
Anthony or I think that's a way to limit

00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:18,169
review because there's a whole lot more

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,909
work that we do yes yes III agree I

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:23,509
totally agree there is a lot of other

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:29,299
work yeah totally it's not in the larger

00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:32,029
scale of some kind yeah yes yes now then

00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:34,879
I mean look and you talked about the

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,589
latest version of plasma there was a

00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,319
time when there was used to be confusion

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,120
around the naming and the versioning but

00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:43,519
everything has settled down or people

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,020
still talk about hey I'm a KD user no

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,830
you are a plasma user kid

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:52,700
in community but when we look at the new

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,500
version of Tasha plasma okay this is

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,130
some I'll jump too much on too many

00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,290
Farfan because I'm a fiction writer jump

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,960
around a lot of things because I cover a

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,940
lot of enterprises space and then I go

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,550
to all these conferences OpenStack or

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,080
darker I see you know where the word is

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:15,140
moving and sadly what I see on a stage a

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,840
lesson takes a red hat submit or Susak

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,210
on whether it's docker con or open Stax

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,970
a meter no matter coop corn all I see is

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,740
Mac OS s or even on the know there was

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,900
no Mac OS on Linux Foundation so that

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,860
whole and garbage was nonsense there was

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,420
not even comes ambling no he was not no

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,850
he may be using it privately everybody

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,460
uses you know Mac OS privately even I am

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,680
recording right now on Mac OS but what I

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,050
mean to say is that all the developers

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,080
they use Mac OS s that I have talked a

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,540
lot of people so my question to you is

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,100
that when you look at the the desktop

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,420
what is your target audience and then

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,020
you look at all these events that they

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,000
are using Mac so how do you what do you

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,490
feel about it how and how do you plan to

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,670
actually understand their problems and

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,590
then try to solve them so that when I

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,470
see them using Mac OS I actually don't

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,150
see their failure I see failure of the

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,940
desktop that is not capable to handle

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,730
their workload so so my question to you

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,250
is that how do you plan to change the

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,370
landscape so that more and more such

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,710
open-source people are use you know KDE

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:30,590
or Linux desktop on their systems and

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:33,380
not Mac OS s so this actually killed two

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,060
really important though fairly general

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,900
things that we're that we're

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,420
concentrating on one is somewhat the

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:48,740
conservative angle that we're trying to

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:51,440
make the software more solid so we're

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,720
we're polishing a lot and I think in

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,260
that regard we've been actually doing

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,900
really well and

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:02,190
our public perception shall set as well

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,500
so we've been really getting good

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,370
reviews there's lots of positive vibes

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,620
brand around plasma and are our users

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:16,260
and future users really seem to

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:19,050
appreciate the D strategy of polishing

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,000
the current code base making it faster

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:25,800
making it slicker fixing bugs and then

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,770
starting this process over and fixing

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,180
more that in effect I think this really

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:36,210
speaks to one of the core values in KT

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,270
which we actually haven't been doing so

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:44,340
well in maybe in the past year sports

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:46,470
now we have overhauled our platform for

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,340
a few years with the introduction of KD

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:56,760
frameworks and so the plasma v

00:11:49,340 --> 00:12:00,720
architecture um we are having a series

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,760
of years become what we can polishing

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,950
without large architectural changes

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,560
because we actually invested a lot of

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:13,890
time and effort in future proofing the

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:17,790
underlying code base so my positive

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:20,520
takeaway from that is that with the

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,900
hardship we especially when we

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:28,680
introduced the first version of plasma

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,350
we now have a long streak of what really

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,140
matters to to use us and what's what

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,890
gets us a positive feedback we're fixing

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:41,370
fixing fixing improving and and

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,680
polishing and by the feedback we're

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,270
getting now especially about the fact

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,510
went well for Elise which is really

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,790
about stability and performance this is

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,510
exactly what what users expect from us

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,670
and it's also a message that they can

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,870
really appreciate while it's much harder

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,730
to communicate to them that the

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,850
underlying work could be done because

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,350
before we can actually reach this this

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,700
stage where we can build up on a modern

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,580
snack for

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:16,770
for a few years that is the the

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,770
retrospective the conservative angle on

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:23,610
that but we're also looking looking

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:26,310
forward and this one aspect which is

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,740
really close to to my heart and my

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:34,770
belief system actually that's the

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:39,450
privacy angle I think that what this

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:45,420
world really needs is the tools to to

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:48,870
protect yourself the tools to give you

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:52,560
the possibility of leading a private

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:54,600
life because complete openness and

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,940
exposure of private data has become the

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,010
default and while this situation isn't

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:05,550
that bad right now I think things like

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:08,460
identity theft are going to become a

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:11,030
really huge problem we already saw in

00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:15,150
the past free in the past year that

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:18,240
large governmental organizations have

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:21,060
have their computers kidnapped and there

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,950
were hospitals which had been pretty

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:28,730
much remotely shut down and this is the

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:31,860
the cyber war which most people actually

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,960
did not fully understand right now but

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,130
which is going to be a really big

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:40,530
problem and that's here and anticipating

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,440
angle where buildings it was right now

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:47,790
and rallying the community behind

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,920
ourselves to build strong software that

00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:54,000
can help you fight you against these

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,770
things I totally agree with you on the

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,660
on the privacy of things are going on

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:03,420
but the the bigger challenge in the big

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,330
question is that no matter how good the

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:10,050
tool is if nobody is using it what is

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:13,410
the point you know so as as much as you

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,450
know your focus is on I mean for example

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,470
if everybody's using Facebook it doesn't

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,510
really matter you know whether you're

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,459
running on Katie or gnomes you know or

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,529
your login to a gmail account so it

00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:27,439
defies the whole

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:32,749
purpose so but Desktop Linux has always

00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:34,459
been you know kind of not that much a

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:38,870
success Linux is successful everywhere

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:40,670
else so so how do you plan to put carry

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,220
desktop in more people's hand because

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,620
people want the they used on Peter to

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,240
get the work done that is their primary

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,709
goal you know everything else comes

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,870
secondary so so so so when you look at

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,600
all these users how do you really plan

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:59,059
to make it easier for them to get their

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,339
work done so that they can once they use

00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:03,439
the platform and the the mind share of

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,899
that platform increases then you can

00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:07,699
actually help people with their privacy

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,829
things because otherwise everybody will

00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:12,499
be running Windows and Mac OS maybe one

00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:14,329
percent people are using the Linux

00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:17,329
desktop but that defies the whole

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:21,499
purpose right um so a ways where we see

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:26,149
this going assess that the class of

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:29,269
desktop computers and and full scale

00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:34,360
laptops is actually decreasing and the

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:37,730
use cases are becoming more limited but

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,889
so where are people moving they're

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,769
moving to smartphones but they're also

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:45,589
moving to more purpose in embedded

00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:48,470
hardware and this is actually where one

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:51,259
of the focus areas especially of but

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:54,459
also the underlying libraries its line

00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:59,209
so we've been doing a lot of work on

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:02,329
creating the plasma mobile platform not

00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:04,880
much of that is visible right now but to

00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:07,549
make our software run really well on an

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,880
on smaller and embedded devices there's

00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:14,600
not just a different UI needed software

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,630
needs to be a lot leaner so spending a

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,399
lot of time on optimizing plasma on

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,130
optimizing startup time on optimizing

00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:26,209
memory usage especially in the in the

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:28,640
last month to make it easier to run

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:32,810
plasma on these on these smaller systems

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,570
and that is very much

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,880
work that will benefit us in the future

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:42,760
but the good news is it also improves

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,590
the software today so for example a

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,470
small group of us of about 10 people had

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,920
a meeting in December we sit down in a

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:56,020
very nice castle someone in somewhere in

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:59,120
snowy Germany and spend a week on

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,680
optimizing the hell out of out of plasma

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,500
who made it made it start up a lot

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:09,410
faster and optimize memory usage this is

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,420
the kind of kind of boring work to the

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:15,050
general public but it's actually really

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,600
important for people that have high

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,250
expectations of their software um and

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,710
that may want to run it on smaller and

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,340
and embedded devices that said I agree

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,210
with you

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:29,590
we're not really good enough at getting

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,910
the word out right now we are

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,800
professionalizing our marketing

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,320
department a lot more but in the end

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,930
it's just so much we can do how much

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,480
effort do we went do we want to spend on

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,010
marketing and how much effort do want to

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,370
spend on actually improving the software

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,130
and then in my opinion and that's I

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,950
think the right thing to do improving

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,020
the software should always win because

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:57,920
once you have a really good product it

00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,200
will spread itself right yeah I mean I

00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,600
think it's it's a tricky situation that

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,090
there are too much money towards

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,910
marketing but not but at the same time

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,820
if sometimes what happens is if if

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:13,460
marketing Wolves works and like look at

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,980
Alan Musk from you know from SpaceX and

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,620
you know Tesla he is great at marketing

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,150
he I mean I don't know what he thinks or

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,250
what he really believes in but I think

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,900
moving to Mars I mean when there is a

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,340
drought in California you cannot fix

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,530
that and you think about moving a baby

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,030
to Mars but I think what he's trying to

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,550
do is he's just getting everybody

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,670
excited about his SpaceX company that's

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,440
what he's doing I'm sorry Ellen musk for

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,880
the SpaceX who sells the Rockets in the

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,380
space Ellen musk yeah so he's talking

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
about moving everybody to Mars but I

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,980
think he's just getting us excited about

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,440
science one more heat

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,530
doesn't plan to go to Mars same thing he

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,360
is doing with with the with his boring

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,910
company which is taking actually they

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,010
are starting in the DC also so from DC

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,559
to New York it will be just 29 minutes

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,230
you know it takes hours and then he sold

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,330
that frame flamethrower you know and he

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,700
made like 10 million dollars in like two

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,860
days the whole idea is to getting people

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,660
excited when people get so when you do

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,910
put money in marketing it should not

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,730
it's not that money but when you get

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,010
people excited about something then you

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,840
also get mind here when you get mind

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,520
share then you get users when you get

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,200
users you get developers when you get

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,059
developers then they work on the

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,830
ecosystem and then you get the ecosystem

00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,570
that's what do you want in the end so I

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,549
think it's yeah if you do need you know

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,460
a smart people like him or Steve Jobs

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,110
who can get people excited about

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,299
technology without actually making any

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,380
compromises with the technology in

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,760
general so I don't think you know

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,830
marketing but you have to be smart

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,799
enough to do that otherwise you might

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,880
end up making a lot of mistakes that

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,100
unfortunately canonical made in past

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,290
with their foolish project will be

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,860
created too much hype but they fail to

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:56,299
deliver it anyways know why we're

00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:01,280
spending our European Friday afternoon

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:03,380
talking to you and second thing by

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,270
talking about castles yeah because we I

00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,070
live in Germany Garmisch and it's like

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,049
every time we open a car there would be

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,720
a castle next door let's get back to the

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,480
money part so now you guys just got an

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,280
in a huge a pile of money I don't know

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,080
where it came from so can you talk about

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,080
that what's going on there

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:32,600
so the pineapple fund is a guy who made

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,690
a lot of bitcoins in the early days of

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:41,330
bitcoins and now is giving it away to

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:43,280
nonprofits that he cares about and he is

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,970
one of the organizations that applied

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:52,850
and were selected for for for donation

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:55,850
and we got $200,000 from from him and

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,630
that is the biggest donation KETV has

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:03,440
ever gotten and that is pretty

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:06,170
we're excited about that and put it to

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,550
good use for the community so should I

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,960
should I set up my organization as a

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:13,310
nonprofit subject and base for him so

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,900
how are you okay

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,430
I don't know whether you can you can

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,950
talk about it or not but I do think it

00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:21,170
is sheer stuff so what is your annual

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,330
you know other was traditionally how

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:28,550
much you know funding that you get every

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:31,040
year I would have to look at the exact

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:35,770
numbers I don't have them here but this

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:38,510
this is about doubling our current money

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,010
okay and from what Sebastian told me

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,930
earlier that most of this money goes to

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,430
our actual development work and not too

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,510
much diverse marketing and all that

00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:49,490
stuff so when you say development work

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,320
from cadiz perspective the way I look at

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,810
it it's mostly you know volunteers are

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,180
there so where do you use this money how

00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,040
how does I mean for the I mean you talk

00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,080
about events are there but do you also

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,980
have like full-time developers or

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:08,660
graphic designers or you know you know

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:12,830
can you talk about that KD is current

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:16,400
money does not go towards development we

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:19,040
have one person paid part time to assist

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,000
the board and the community with

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:26,230
organizational matters and two people

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,760
contracted to support our marketing team

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:33,610
beyond that there's no people who are

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:37,190
paid by camy to work on ke topics now

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:41,360
versus money we are having the

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:46,120
discussions now how to use this money in

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,230
the most impactful way for for ke a

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,570
among the things that are being

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,540
discussed is hiring two people to do

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:58,730
specific things or contracting people to

00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:02,620
do specific things so example doing

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:05,420
documentation cleanups or doing

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:09,050
usability tests or helping us with

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:12,320
marketing research and things like that

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:14,450
when you say documentation I

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,950
because I have actually not much into

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,759
documentation because I don't need any

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,230
kind of documentation it's kind of is it

00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,610
just in one language of multiple

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:28,159
languages as well and we do have some of

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,250
the user documentation translated in

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,320
many languages yes developer

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,600
documentation I believe is mostly in

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,139
English yeah because that's kind of

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,000
universal language so in addition to

00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:42,679
that as we were like talking to

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,929
Sebastian earlier and there are some

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,399
core areas which do need to be addressed

00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,220
you know to make you know the next

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:52,879
desktop more appealing and since now you

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,909
do have a big chunk of money so why do

00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:59,899
you think documentation is data but

00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:02,240
instead of let's say getting a developer

00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:04,399
who can you know really do a lot of

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,470
dedicated work on either mobile platform

00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,750
or maybe a graphics guy who can you know

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,830
improve the overall stack because I

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,779
don't really know how many people

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,240
actually I mean I never read any manual

00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:15,649
to be honest I buy camera they did send

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,169
a big thick manual but I never read it

00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:20,480
so how do you really prioritize that

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:24,769
okay this is more important than this

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:29,139
and that what we're trying to do is

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:33,169
invest in multipliers if you've got

00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:35,000
$200,000 and you invested into C++

00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:40,789
software development you won't get very

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,730
far what we are trying to do is make it

00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:48,070
easy and appealing for volunteer

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:51,679
developers to to chip in and then

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,409
$200,000 can get you very far so that's

00:25:51,679 --> 00:26:00,549
true we look at these these areas that

00:25:54,409 --> 00:26:05,000
are that are we that can be boost from

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:09,080
from a one-time or perhaps longer term

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,220
but rather low key amount of money and

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:16,509
we try to use these as multipliers to

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,679
get the word out to people and

00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:21,260
documentation happens to be one of these

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,950
areas that is under represented under

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,039
represented and

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:30,480
that really eats the developer time it

00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,669
also needs a different skill set so if

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,159
you ask a software developer to write

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:37,980
user documentation you get

00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,799
incomprehensible documentation also I

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,279
know yeah you are wasting the time of

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,139
someone with the difference he'll set

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,960
something which person really doesn't

00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:54,389
like so much are you making on the one

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,070
and you're going for a less than optimal

00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:59,580
result and on the other hand you're

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:03,059
boring a volunteer developer leading to

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,740
a quicker burnout so we want the people

00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,440
that are developing to be able to

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:11,279
concentrate on development as much as

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,039
possible so the money will typically go

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,279
into organizing meetings for these

00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:19,409
people on running a smooth organization

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:24,269
on running infrastructure that can make

00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:27,299
these people productive because the

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:30,450
funny thing is that there are actually

00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:32,610
enough people around that really like to

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,610
do software development it just needs to

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:39,960
be appealing it doesn't it must not be

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:42,090
something that you could be your area

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,149
lacking documentation where are you but

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,820
you're working with really slow under

00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:49,200
maintain infrastructure away you're

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,029
running into political issues all the

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,990
time so we're trying to smooth them out

00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:57,659
the organization not to make development

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,899
as much fun as possible and that allows

00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:04,260
us to get their really talented people

00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:09,480
in our community to be to be really

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:11,639
productive yeah yeah please do it so

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,840
exactly a service said right if we

00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:20,549
enable what if we pay one person to to

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,679
write code for example then that only

00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,139
gets us so far but if we pay someone to

00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:29,010
make it easier for a hundred developers

00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:31,769
to join us and and write code right that

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:33,299
gets us much much further so we are

00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:36,450
looking exactly into those things that

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,580
have much more long-term and I'm going

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,399
to

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,230
social impact yeah and then it has

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,450
always been a committed evil project so

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,429
you really not want you know Katie

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,169
employees you know developing software

00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,360
it will also be I think it may also

00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:50,769
discourage a lot of people that

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,080
somebody's getting paid to do the same

00:28:50,769 --> 00:29:06,399
code that I'm writing in my free time

00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:07,520
yeah okay so now you have tested this

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,100
much money

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:14,559
[Laughter]

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,929
what other efforts are there because

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,159
Katie is still I think mostly Europe

00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:23,440
centric how do you plan to kind of grow

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,139
beyond Europe so that people you know

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,720
from North America or Australia or other

00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:31,059
you know rich countries can also kind of

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,519
participate and give more money which

00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:36,130
can help it so the gist of the question

00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,980
is how do you plan to grow beyond your

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:45,370
traditional you know strong castle which

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:48,159
is in Europe actually already a pretty

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,649
strong community in your example that is

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,929
regularly organizing conferences that

00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:59,169
are yeah and really successful and get a

00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:02,500
lot of new people in there is presenting

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:05,909
community for example there's doing

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:10,899
conferences local meetups and and so on

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:12,190
so there is that already and we one of

00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:14,730
the things we're trying to do is make

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,039
that much more visible right and

00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,970
encourage more people to to do that and

00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,240
to join in

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:24,460
I mean North America is has always been

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,750
a big market for a company you know so

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,850
how do you really play I mean look at

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,559
Red Hat they are so big because you know

00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,860
they are king of the north if I can use

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:34,510
the analogy from Game of Thrones so how

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,620
do you really I mean do you have any

00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:42,570
plans for moving kind of increasing the

00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:45,470
US market has been very much a

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,750
problematic thing for us all the time

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,140
[Music]

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:53,680
I I agree with Lydia I wouldn't say that

00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:57,580
Katie suddenly Europe has a strong

00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,500
community in Europe but just looking at

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,640
it this Europe and this says the u.s. is

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:08,100
missing a very large part of the world

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:11,680
so yeah we've got a unity in India in

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:15,700
Latin America actually Latin America

00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:18,550
tends to we also see that in Spain this

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,850
tends to me it's on ecosystem because

00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:23,310
there's actually a critical mass of

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:26,620
Spanish or Brazilian Portuguese speech

00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:30,570
people so it doesn't need to be very

00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:34,270
outward looking it can be very very much

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:40,210
contained Brazil is huge both in terms

00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:43,080
of actual geographical size but also in

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:47,350
terms of suffer and having been to

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,480
Brazil for a few times is huge there

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,960
that's it you're completely right

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:57,220
and we really haven't been able to get a

00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:01,650
foot in the door in the US and a lot of

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:05,500
that has to do with a critical mass I

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:10,390
have a number of projects that I know

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:14,590
about that we're trying to actually get

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:18,630
a critical mass going in the US or or

00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:24,090
North America none of that has really

00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:26,320
has really been successful so far I

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:32,040
honestly don't really know at this point

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:36,450
how how we can approach that that market

00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:40,750
because then it's also very hard for us

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:44,200
for us to grasp it seems very close by

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,450
culturally but then especially in terms

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,760
of community involvement

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,820
the differences are are huge and

00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:55,720
something that works really well in

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:59,300
Europe for example presence at events um

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,430
is completely different in the US and

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,530
I guess that we are really at the strong

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,590
cultural divide which doesn't help us a

00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,240
lot so yeah we need some really cool

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,910
people in the US that really understand

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,970
these community dynamics and that can

00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:17,170
help us get going yeah I mean then I

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,170
look at all the commercial open source

00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,300
there are you know all they are mostly

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,820
us-based they are growing a lot in Asia

00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,860
but I think with the US is that even a

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,660
Brazilian market is big it's not an

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,210
influential market for the rest of the

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,490
world you know but us kind of becomes an

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,890
influential market I mean Alan musk is

00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,690
the South American when he moved to us

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,340
and now everybody around the world talks

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,830
about a SpaceX you know because it's

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,690
India does Israel European have a rose

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,300
but nobody talks about that so somehow

00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,190
us also becomes an influential you know

00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,760
kind of you know and big influence over

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:55,010
everybody else so so being active in the

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,840
US yes it can help a lot in the growth

00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,120
of the project as well but it's a hard

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,430
nut to crack but the thing is US is a is

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,010
a place I mean not in the current

00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:07,160
political situation because yesterday

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,720
just the the they removed that u.s. is a

00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,520
land of immigrants from their you know

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,350
the partner I think the homeland

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,820
security of whatever it is they removed

00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,860
it from their official statement so

00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,060
things are changing here it's funny

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,010
because Souza Khan is moving to

00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,409
Vancouver Linux Khan is moving to

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,510
Vancouver and then OpenStack summit is

00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,970
moving to Vancouver so nobody wants to

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:29,050
come to us anymore because of this

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:31,370
current so there is a lot of but yeah

00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,230
but I think North America because of the

00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:36,679
English English language it can be

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:40,550
helpful honestly you know I can actually

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:43,429
appreciate the irony in that because I

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,679
was talking about the privacy and

00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:49,070
security angle earlier on and probably

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,860
the countries that would need software

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:57,130
that can solve these problems post is

00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:59,420
the u.s. exactly that also has this

00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:02,480
radiating effect on the rest of the

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,820
world because the weak standards about

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,060
privacy and data security on the US

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,710
easily bleed over into other countries

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,940
through trade agreements but also

00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:16,559
through just

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:21,809
cultural influence that is the that u.s.

00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:25,079
culture is seen as as an example of how

00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:27,230
it could be done or in the worst case

00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,950
what you can actually get away with

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:34,470
right I would just like when we do talk

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,920
about us in quiz I was at openness text

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,240
I mean in Australia the last year and of

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,920
course it's the Austin you know it

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,190
started from Austin Texas

00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,109
and I met the director variety of China

00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,509
railways they are using you know

00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,250
OpenStack they are a big big user of you

00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:52,920
you know an open source and OpenStack I

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,960
meant 10 cent which is not three major

00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,609
Chinese vendors that they are the one

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,039
who powered which at you know platform

00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:01,829
and they use OpenStack and open source

00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,150
so everybody is moving because as I said

00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:06,480
once again you know for some reason

00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:09,329
Americans somehow know how to tout the

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,549
language plays a big role they know how

00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,200
to market package and when I go to all

00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:14,609
this conference I get amazed that you

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,009
know add one and P have Desktop Linux

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,990
but nobody talks about and at the end

00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:20,880
everything else everybody using is

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,549
open-source I mean they don't even talk

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,579
about close source technologies at all

00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:28,859
they they won't consider anything which

00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,690
is not open source period China is

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,970
building their own public cloud to

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,640
compete with Amazon based on you know

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,099
open source private cloud so it's

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,079
amazing that's a huge success story

00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:43,079
because when I when I started getting

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,200
into open source it was it was basically

00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:50,130
open source against proprietary code and

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:53,940
and also free software is very much the

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,950
underdog and if anything we've clearly

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,430
won won this battle

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:03,450
um but instead of celebrating that um

00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:05,730
there is no way around development the

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,490
open development model and actually

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,410
reads in your your source code we need

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,500
to look at the next challenge

00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:16,049
and that my opinion is data security and

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:20,220
privacy or we can make a real impact on

00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:22,920
people and when we when the free

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,119
software movement started out nobody was

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,369
aware of the challenges that

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,759
it's often right now everybody has moved

00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:34,720
to it's become the undersea industry

00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:36,640
standard.i miss in order to to win the

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,799
next battle and in that case it doesn't

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,230
matter if it's or yeah he's a free

00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:45,819
software that solves these things we

00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,470
need to make make an impact there's to

00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:50,140
solve real problems because in the end

00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:52,660
I'm not doing this to advance plasma

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,059
logic ad community I write because I

00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:58,599
have a strong belief and that there are

00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:02,589
real problems to solve while you do talk

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,990
about you know the next state when we

00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:08,109
look at from the from the perspective of

00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,970
platforms we are moving towards the V

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:11,650
word which is moving towards VR virtual

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,420
reality I have a Playstation and

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,999
everything which is VR I watch we are a

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,529
lot we are moving towards an IOT driven

00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:21,730
world which because we are more and more

00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:22,779
devices are becoming smarter so when we

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,849
look at the future very though

00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:26,230
everything will the Tesla if the cards

00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,990
will be low the computers on veal you

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,430
know basically so so when we look at the

00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,769
future this is the future we are going

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:37,569
to live in so how prepared are you as a

00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:41,619
KD KD community one to either be running

00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:44,950
in the devices number two to become a

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:47,650
platform for developers which they can

00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,200
use to create either services or

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:53,470
software or content for this platform so

00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,150
these are two so so from your point of

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:59,259
view where do you stand for in that

00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:01,450
future yeah so there's a few there's a

00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:04,720
few interesting projects projects going

00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,009
on which one of which we actually have

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,619
talked about a lot already which is

00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:12,099
plasma mobile and the general effort on

00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:14,680
making the KD frameworks and plasma

00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:17,710
technology more friendly to embedded

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,999
systems but and we haven't actually

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:24,239
talked about that a lot we also started

00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:26,619
other discussions to partner with a

00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,509
company that is building smart speakers

00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:32,589
which is one of the hugest quickest

00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:37,540
exactly that yeah

00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:39,040
quickest growing markets right now so I

00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,880
can't actually talk about a lot about

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,880
that but probably within the next week

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,160
there will be within the next week's

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:52,060
news will be out that Katie is going to

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:56,440
connect with any company that that

00:39:52,060 --> 00:40:01,210
that's smart because on based on open

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:03,910
source technology and there are some

00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:06,490
efforts in this field going on but yeah

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:09,490
we're we're looking at these new markets

00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,410
that are that are popping up developing

00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,310
we're looking at how we how we can

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:17,740
contribute to the goals of the companies

00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,900
that we believe get it right that build

00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,359
on free software that respect privacy

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,810
and it'll security just trying to make

00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:27,640
an making impact there yeah I mean like

00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,890
I think even mobile phone is just a

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,170
placeholder before no like I'm getting

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,119
the airport's so I actually don't need

00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,130
my phone at all it just sits in a corner

00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,410
I just veered across the home and I via

00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,480
a watch and I don't need my phone

00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,150
yeah and one deist and then you have

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,119
this you know smarter speakers I have

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,830
never actually bothered to open the web

00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:52,210
to ask for something you know I just

00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:55,230
talk to it and I get my answers and but

00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:57,190
when you talk about these platforms

00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,750
machine learning and artificial

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,859
intelligence is going to play a big role

00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,330
in this space yeah I think what you're

00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:07,359
talking about is building the platform

00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,070
but you know like google has open source

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,080
tensorflow which is their machine

00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,540
learning deep learning platform they've

00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,420
also released cube flow which is to

00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:18,760
manage your but your talk maybe we can

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,130
talk next week because the platform

00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,150
itself is not good enough unless until

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,460
you have some machine learning

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,220
capabilities or data to actually you

00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:30,550
know feed back into the the smarter

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,260
speakers so that could be another area

00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,060
where we can talk about you know that is

00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,770
software stack is not as important as

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,710
that having data so if you don't have

00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:42,430
data that's actually different aspects

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:44,650
for us we we're happy to work with

00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:47,350
people who are directly contributing

00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:50,280
what's our long term goals of

00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:52,630
basically creating a better world for

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,480
right.you providing more freedom to

00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:59,800
people there's also for the matron

00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:02,710
benefits like if we can collaborate with

00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,710
companies that aren't building

00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:08,080
everything using our technologies but

00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,420
that just a library to solve a certain

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,140
problem for example to download a gala

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:17,290
and to pass the data out of it then

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,840
these companies could be interested in

00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,790
one of the literally hundreds of

00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,910
libraries where we're providing and

00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:27,730
contributing back to that and not that

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,950
also has huge benefit for us both in

00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:33,190
terms of contribution but also in terms

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:37,000
of in marketing terms because that

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,950
actually gets the word out if this

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,550
company is using it then this must be

00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:44,050
kind of useful so others will do so as

00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,270
well so we're actually growing our

00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:49,330
ecosystem with that and we're creating

00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:52,450
Network effects so um there's really a

00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:55,510
lot of different sometimes more subtle

00:42:52,450 --> 00:43:00,520
ways where we can benefit from the from

00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:03,130
collaborating with others right yeah

00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,510
that is a word that's why I don't a

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,950
platform got Tia fire which is the

00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,510
fourth Industrial Revolution which is

00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,730
all powered by software driven stuff

00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,130
inst so this is an area where I'm

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,750
keeping my eyes on you know the emerging

00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,920
technologies that are coming up so that

00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,180
will be an interesting and he can

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,260
certainly we should talk about it

00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,359
whenever you have something more

00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,190
concrete about it and Eddie has always

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,190
been kind of you know from the early

00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,660
days also a lot of in the desktop space

00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,010
you know you guys were doing a lot of

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,020
things which were like later on

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,180
implemented by Apple in Mac OS and

00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,130
Microsoft in Windows and everything else

00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,050
so you guys have always been ahead of

00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,030
the curve because you know it's a big

00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,230
diverse community from people from all

00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,850
around the globe you know they are

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,680
bringing you know their ideas to the

00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,840
community so no one can match that

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,060
either way you know that's your strength

00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,980
alone and it's open source so anybody

00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,980
can just come in and join in and through

00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,570
the idea and started writing the code

00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,250
interesting thing is that we are in some

00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:58,690
Harris were very much ahead of the curve

00:43:54,250 --> 00:44:01,599
but also our core business is being

00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:06,220
just behind the curve the

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:11,680
commoditization of technology so we see

00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:13,810
that that some innovations are at first

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,640
only available to very small group of

00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:20,349
people that that a freight or where the

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,920
software's huge restrictions on either

00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:28,030
geographic spread or the demographic

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,910
that it that it reaches and then people

00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:33,910
come along and implement a free software

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:36,700
solution that is just solving the same

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:41,800
problem and then regarded to be more

00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:46,690
flexible and a better solution so in

00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:49,589
that light we are making we are behind

00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:53,020
the curve in terms of technology but

00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:57,060
we're making this technology available

00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,060
to a much much larger group of people

00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,480
before anything else that you think we

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,069
should discuss about in terms of this

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,930
big funding or I think we have we have

00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:09,190
covered a lot of broad topics and they

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,109
should always leave a lot of things for

00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,990
the next one so that we can continue to

00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:15,849
have more conversations yeah

00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,000
first I'm sure we won't run out of

00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:21,339
topics any times yes oh my yeah then

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,700
with respect to the to the funding

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:27,670
topics we're very much looking into how

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:32,530
we how we can use it in the best

00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:35,680
possible way right now not just throwing

00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:38,560
money out of the window we're really

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,800
looking at work where can make the the

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,210
biggest impact and so this isn't the

00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,800
thing that just pays for for a week yeah

00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,240
and if you do plan to throw the money

00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,560
out of window just tell me where you are

00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,250
throwing it I'll be there behind I

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:58,510
understand I think he general concerns

00:45:54,250 --> 00:46:04,810
us is that that's gets her on the

00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:06,310
Ferrari and we'll be done with it yeah I

00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,760
think she has a private jet or something

00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,760
like that

00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:19,759
much bigger donation for that but okay

00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:23,119
so Libya any more closing words before

00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:26,150
we wrap up this interview thanks so much

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,109
we should definitely continue this at

00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:31,489
some point hopefully soon when we

00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:34,190
decided on the first things to arrest

00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:36,170
them and let's see what it brings for

00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,670
Katie okay awesome

00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,619
thank you so much for your time and I

00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,599
look forward to meeting you all in I

00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:44,479
have met a lot of committee members in

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,549
person but not you too so I am looking

00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:48,140
forward to coming to Academy and you

00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:50,829
know covering it and doing a lot of

00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:55,749
videos there and talking all the stories

00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:55,749
yeah thanks for your time and see you

00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:01,549
thanks for watching and that was a great

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,519
discussion of what Katie and I as we

00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:07,400
discussed in future will be talking a

00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,809
lot to the Katie committee members so

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,160
that we can continue to tell all the

00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:14,150
great stories all the great work that

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,969
the Katie committee is doing and so for

00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,069
