	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,950
so we're starting now with the Debian

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:13,720
derivatives both the both moratoria both

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,320
speaker proposer is a Paul Weiss okay so

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,640
[Music]

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
the way I thought we would structure

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,199
this is start off with some

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,529
introductions from people who are

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,840
involved in derivatives and Debian and

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,970
then some open discussion about issues

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,969
and stuff and finally we will talk about

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,300
some things that Debian is working on

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,760
within this context including the front

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,370
desk the decks which is a little bit

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,289
inactive at the moment the Census and

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:49,039
our derivatives guidelines which kind of

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,340
a how-to for running a derivative

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,489
okay so ganar can you pass the mic

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,489
around

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:05,430
I'm Paul Weiss I'm working on the

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:07,530
derivative census and a little bit of

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,770
the other things that Debian is doing I

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,290
came to Debian because of knoppix so

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,880
yeah derivatives are the reason why I'm

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,530
here in Devon

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,479
I get the reason why I'm here in Debian

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,189
about the fusing Debian is probably

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:30,240
because of states which is another

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:31,409
Debian derivative I'm Stephan Rivera I'm

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,240
a Debian developer and a bundle

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,430
developer I don't do too much in the

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,759
derivatives community but I sit in both

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,100
communities that's why I'm here I'm

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:47,100
Jonathan also from a green tea and also

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:50,840
edible tea I'm Jonathan - I am being

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,840
here by interesting

00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:12,840
a man's car and I'm just the art of

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,030
interest as well I just use Debian

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:23,790
mostly and well sometimes I actually use

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:29,100
a motor sir anyone else do something

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:32,280
where's I am Fernando I I'm here

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:37,440
Pixar interested in the alimentation

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:51,930
between Ubuntu and Debian called novo

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:54,660
now a part of the text okay so does

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,250
anyone have anything I want to issues

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:07,530
they want to bring up or things that

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:11,209
have worked well perhaps in trigger II

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,209
you can talk about some tiles things

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,140
well perhaps it a bit early to discuss

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,989
that because I have things I have in

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,840
mind are for wizzy plus one probably but

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:30,300
given that we when we'll meet again

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,880
we'll have been working a new easy plus

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:39,620
one for a while already so perhaps make

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:43,500
sense right now okay

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,470
I've been working a perm or integration

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,230
to Debian a perm or is a mandatory

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:54,090
access control framework that's kind of

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:57,360
security thing no and it happens that

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,000
we're going to has been using this a bit

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,470
for a while and using it more and more

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,520
and it's been out of three at the kernel

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,040
level it used to be but not anymore and

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,550
we will get a pramana belt kernel in

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,570
whizzie

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:25,380
and some very minimal promo supports and

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:29,520
the in userspace I really would like

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,669
this support be improved a lot in Debian

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:38,580
during the with the plus one lives

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:41,280
recycle but it's given how it works

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:45,780
since a few months it's pretty clear

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:52,200
that can't happen just by efforts done

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:56,280
by alone Debian developer so I think I

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,560
will go reach the open to people and say

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,590
eh you want to reduce your delta

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,870
presumably and we want that in Debian

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,030
let's make this or else go and come help

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:14,930
us and let's maintain these profiles

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:19,440
together I'm not sure how this

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:22,169
integrates with the existing Dex and

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,810
other pieces of infrastructure the

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:29,910
technical details probably can be left

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:32,340
for later it seems like a good project

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:37,320
for people doing the Dex Monty deck

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:40,970
stuff to work on Paul I have a question

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,860
here from a Kevin mark he asks whether

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:49,880
is there any derivatives having any

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:53,820
plans for I Lea Phi I guess I Bunter has

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:59,010
their plans for you if you are yeah you

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:01,979
you know too much about but I know our

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,140
CDs already supported and it works it's

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:08,090
been Debian installer as far as I know

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,090
so presumably the petrol sir in the BTS

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,990
I'm secure boots you can read all about

00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,990
son

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:40,430
we have one late arrival maybe you'd

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:47,140
like to introduce yourself my name is

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:52,700
Ruth my name is RIS I'm from Venezuela

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:57,470
me and one partner are here from Canaan

00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:03,050
my distribution we're looking forward to

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:08,410
share experiences things we should do

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:14,770
things we shouldn't do how we can

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:20,360
collaborate with each other in our work

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:22,160
so that's it for those people who don't

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,300
know they can I am a distribution could

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:32,890
you say something about it

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:38,680
of course well can I started around 2008

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:46,970
it was version wine one point point zero

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:58,220
was based on edge I think version 2.0

00:07:46,970 --> 00:08:05,360
was on Lenny then current version stable

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:11,120
version 3.0 was is on squeezy and as you

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:16,250
see were synchronized with stable Debian

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:23,020
distribution so version four will be on

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:27,440
with Z basically kanima is promoted by

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:32,660
Venezuelan government for several

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:37,729
projects one of its the derivatives that

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,680
is kind of famous in the country is they

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,849
can I may look at Evo

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:48,260
Karima for the children so the

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:55,100
government puts canaima in those laptops

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:58,880
for ya location and the children

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:03,830
basically there are almost 2 million of

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:08,870
those computers in the country so that's

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:11,300
what basically came at us with we have a

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,180
question from the IRC again from Kevin

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,640
mark he asked whether collaboration a

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,480
means to share the language translation

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:25,100
or to use a common server or if you have

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,920
a similar uses like those in telecentres

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,750
I mean what what's the collaboration and

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,070
they and I would add what they mean like

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:42,500
uniqueness the main difference they you

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:49,820
have with well basically we need well

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:52,070
connect goes to primarily the National

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,520
Public Administration of Venezuela

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,339
although there are others virtual

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:03,260
versions of Canada that again goes to

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:08,839
general public but basically we need

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:12,940
newer software in canaima and as we

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:19,000
based on stable daemon stable we need a

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:22,970
backwards so also we need special

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,350
specialized software that otherwise we

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:34,899
would have to wait 2 years or the main

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:40,720
David Debian cycle 2 for it to be in

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:42,829
Debian stable so we added locally I

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,970
didn't I didn't understand the

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,970
collaboration part

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:53,009
it will the the exact wording

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,649
he says collaboration equals share

00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:58,980
language translators or use a common

00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:01,589
server or you have similar uses well

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:08,689
they use as part is covered but your he

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:08,689
says can write so yeah we haven't

00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:18,089
addressed I mean we will starting now to

00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:20,879
retribute

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,959
our word to Devon actually that's why

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:28,429
we're here

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:32,369
so now we haven't done much of

00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:36,990
collaboration to the Our Fathers

00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:40,379
distribution so but we're starting to do

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:45,809
it now we're starting to get packages in

00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:53,249
shape so that they start being in Debian

00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:56,670
and retrofitting that work slightly

00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:59,870
bouncing again to the well the topic on

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:05,879
Ubuntu that was say already mentioned a

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:08,339
Kusanagi a asks is it too crazy to have

00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,800
some kind of PPA integration with Debian

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,589
actually wouldn't be nice to have some

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,610
kind of PPA in place for Debian to allow

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:19,399
work as a pre integration in the project

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,379
he was questioned whether the it's a

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,019
pertinent question for this talk he

00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,179
answers I feel there's a lot of

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,579
packaging potential out there that

00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,040
Debian is not taking advantage of maybe

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:34,049
Ubuntu PPA are not what Debian needs but

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,259
maybe would to packagers can have an

00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:40,639
easy transition packaging upstream so

00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:40,639
you know if you want to comment on this

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,879
again I'm not a canonical person but so

00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,499
Canonical's haven't been asked if we

00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,139
could have support Debian or other

00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:54,119
derivatives on open to PPA or launch pad

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,980
PPS and the answer has been no because

00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:58,620
it's a fairly expensive service to run

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,089
and they don't want it to cost any more

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,879
than it's already costing

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,709
there have been fairly frequent talks

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,110
about PPAs and debian which is probably

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,639
a far more appropriate answer to this

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,490
problem but the last I heard that was

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,399
going to be for Debian developers only

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,600
so by the time you get to that point

00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,559
you've probably already integrated a lot

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,559
of things back into Debian

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:42,790
okay just while Paul finishes writing

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,850
this a I you know that as far as I

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,610
follow the discussions having TPS in

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,460
Debian would be a as you say restricted

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,350
to Debian developers mainly because of

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,640
legal revision that we cannot just allow

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,070
service to be open to the general public

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,460
without reviewing the content and

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:07,660
redistributing k cannonical has decided

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:11,710
to run with the risks of that well so

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:15,730
far Debian has decided not to there are

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:17,980
also others providing PPS for all

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,850
architectures to the general public

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,450
because the well s build itself is not

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:29,890
very secure so actually you can break

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:32,650
out in various ways so you need to run

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,050
bills for PPS in a virtualized

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:40,090
environment and I think not all

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:42,880
architectures are capable of this but I

00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:47,680
think there have been discussions about

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:52,420
if it is legally possible to provide PPS

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:57,540
to the public in Debian but well nothing

00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:01,530
really happens so far and yes it is not

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,530
the priority I think

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:15,030
so are there any other topics someone

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:20,100
would like to bring up or should we move

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:30,690
on to the derivatives initiatives that

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:32,790
Debian has been working on would the

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,100
people that in Ubuntu like to say

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:40,050
anything about the collaboration between

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Debian and Ubuntu or any other

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:49,590
distribution yeah so me as I want to

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,880
develop her when I am working with you a

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,730
bunch of developers or actually any a

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,500
bunch of developers the first question

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,120
when reviewing an upload is has

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,890
everything that's a bunch of is

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,090
deviating from Debian here being pushed

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,160
to Debian if not why not

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:05,310
is there a way to get there in the

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,020
future I think that's a fairly common

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:12,150
view amongst Ubuntu developers these

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,800
days at least the community once in a

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,380
derivative it's a hell of a lot easier

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,510
to keep maintaining your distribution if

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,520
you push as much upstream as possible

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,260
when you're maintaining a patch set on

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,000
top of something else it's your work if

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,540
you push it upstream it becomes up

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,490
streams problems and it'll be far more

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,640
widely tested and probably work a lot

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,640
better

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,740
in Ubuntu we also have lots of people

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,720
who want to fix bugs and upload new

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,880
packages into printer and then we want

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,430
to say well you know it will actually be

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,459
easier to get it in Debian directly

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,949
otherwise either patch teaming we have a

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:01,259
package that only exists in Ubuntu and

00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:04,169
not in Debian and if you get it into

00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,760
Debian Wow other distributions and

00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:08,579
they've been users benefit from this as

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,669
well but it's sometimes difficult to

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,319
know where to send them within Debian we

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:16,079
can sometimes we try to send them to

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,319
debit mentis but it's not always the

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,500
best place because it's sometimes a bit

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,480
scary for some people and they're not

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,130
sure exactly for Debian community

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,419
necessarily yeah I'm not sure if it

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:32,820
might be useful to have some kind of

00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:34,380
system for that because I would like to

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,419
make it easier to send people who want

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,240
to actually contribute to a boon to to

00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:43,309
Debian and so that I can get their work

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,309
in the proper way

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:55,010
is there any other topics Daniel would

00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:06,210
you like to say something

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:08,130
no so in the audience apart from the

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,650
people in the circle is anyone else

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,650
involved in derivatives so hands

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:48,389
in canaima yet economic we have another

00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:52,859
thing like I think in Venezuela we have

00:18:48,389 --> 00:19:00,719
almost three and four million letters

00:18:52,859 --> 00:19:08,909
because we have a public industry form a

00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:14,729
computer and all computer our release

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:17,339
with canaima okay so it's a lot of

00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:25,349
computer and we have another project in

00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:29,729
this moment and I am the person from

00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:32,070
away promote promote promoting promoting

00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:36,649
this project okay

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:39,539
we have industry for mobile device and

00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:42,749
we have in Venezuela almost three

00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:47,909
industry for mobile device and we need

00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:50,399
and we are working trying to get or

00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:53,639
trying to cooler to collaborate with

00:19:50,399 --> 00:20:00,919
another project like gecko when I open

00:19:53,639 --> 00:20:06,029
word device and we are trying to work

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:10,139
Debian Lima in the mobile device

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:13,379
industry in this moment okay is a Greek

00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:17,940
project and we are working very hard in

00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:20,579
this in this moment okay regarding the

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,979
mobile devices thing lighter and

00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:26,179
aircraft there is a of about Debian

00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:26,179
mobile stuff

00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:32,749
Alex isn't here but yeah I will be at

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,749
that talk that both as well

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:41,030
and their pain cause she wanna coffee

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,280
there have been a couple of mobile

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,070
distributions I'm pretty sure everyone's

00:20:43,280 --> 00:21:03,530
heard of Maemo the n900 that was a

00:20:46,070 --> 00:21:05,150
Devine derivative yeah so have any of

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:09,320
the people involved with derivatives had

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:20,900
any issues trying to contribute back to

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:23,240
Devon and collaborate with Devon a prime

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,680
example if you want L sip support in

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,910
deep package the package maintainers

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:32,570
tell you that they don't want it in it

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,910
and transitioning to exit so they want

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,520
to get rid of a sediment unfortunately

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:40,550
or well the patch for having a sip

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,350
support in it it's like less than ten

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,510
lines or so so it doesn't really hurt

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,040
but for political reasons you can't have

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,510
it because the package maintainers say

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,590
they don't want it even though other

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:54,920
people want to use it and these sort of

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:59,030
things is understandable but it's

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:01,400
hurting progress on other stuff so it

00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:05,330
would be nice to have some sort of way

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,180
to get this stuff into them in even

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,330
though the maintainer doesn't like it

00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,750
but it's just something that doesn't

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,750
harm him

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,750
does that mean linking new libraries and

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,750
difficut

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,830
it's just it doesn't he asked if it

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:38,070
needs a new library no it doesn't it

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,070
just cost as if as it's done with accent

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,070
we do have the technical committee to

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,170
resolve those sort of issues but it's

00:22:48,070 --> 00:23:02,380
probably a bit of a heavyweight thing

00:22:50,170 --> 00:23:05,260
for that particular batch so Stefano you

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,820
mentioned before just record I'm not

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,800
blaming the package maintainers at all

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,040
it's totally understandable why they

00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,620
don't want it just from a point of view

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,760
outside of Debian it's very hard to deal

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,250
with that because that means you

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,240
basically are always working to package

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:25,020
forever and putting your patch forward

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,020
for every upload

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:44,830
one thing have have found slightly how

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:50,620
sometimes is to have released critical

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:54,880
box fix in stable it happened a few

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,759
times that were once the baggage is fix

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,340
it unstable the maintainer does not care

00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:04,480
anymore that there are packages does not

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:08,740
work on squeeze it's not that often but

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,820
I think we probably need more publicity

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:15,970
and awareness about the the various

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:20,080
efforts to to track and and fix our see

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,059
bags in stable so one of the new things

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,149
in Debian that we have is the Debian

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:29,080
maintainer dashboard it's kind of like a

00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:31,659
to-do list that tracks which releases

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,159
things are fixed in and if it's if

00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,460
there's a nasty bug and stable then it

00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,279
will put a to-do item also Rhonda has

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,139
been working on stable release but

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:53,100
critical bugs maybe you'd like to say

00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:56,320
something there's a lot of

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,070
misunderstanding with respect to version

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,169
tracking and how it's properly working

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:05,259
working and even Terrell announced mail

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:08,110
to explain it better because actually

00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:10,720
it's fairly easy but it's also fairly

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,029
easy to get some things wrong if you

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,940
don't know what's going on with text and

00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:22,029
things like that

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:25,240
and I think we still need to get people

00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:28,480
to better understand that stable

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:32,620
actually is a release that we are meant

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:36,639
to support properly and that it's not

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:39,320
that hard anymore to get fixes into

00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:42,059
stable I think

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,729
it's not like that since several years

00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:48,119
now but it's still stuck in the heads of

00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:51,359
some people that it's almost impossible

00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:57,929
to get any fixes into stable which just

00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:59,909
isn't true anymore yeah just world of

00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:02,399
experience from fixing bugs and savers

00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:05,820
so I do that sometimes for my own

00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:08,609
packages which works really well and for

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,609
some other packages with that other

00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:13,460
people are maintaining it helps

00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:18,269
preparing the patch of course and

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:21,029
sometimes people agree to prepare the

00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:23,249
upload if you handle talking to the

00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:32,419
release team because they don't have

00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:35,460
time or rapidly with other things so so

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:40,799
is there anything else on the RC bug

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:42,419
topic no maybe we can go back to the

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,239
issue you mentioned by the a bunch of

00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:52,080
guys before and Debian mentors being

00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:56,190
scary we did you attend the buff earlier

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,909
in the week yeah

00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:03,509
so in general we want that to not be the

00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,649
case so could you elaborate on what kind

00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:13,379
of things people are saying about the

00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:17,849
process well I didn't think it was

00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:20,639
necessarily scary but it is definitely

00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:22,830
very slow which is purely a manpower

00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:25,710
thing and I think that's not an easy

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,129
problem to solve but one thing that was

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,429
encouraging in the sponsoring session

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,539
was that a few deities actually said I

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,570
want to be a sponsor how do I get

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:39,629
involved so it it seemed like not

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:42,149
everyone is as aware of that doesn't

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:44,759
need 40 days to sponsor things like this

00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:49,649
like they should be and maybe if there's

00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:52,110
some campaign maybe even just an email

00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:54,269
every six months or year to

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,220
they've been divided on saying that I we

00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:58,260
kind of would like people to help of

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,860
sponsoring and would you like to get

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:06,419
involved please contact this address or

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:08,340
David so a reason I could think that

00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,289
Debian mentos appease considered pretty

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,309
scary of you and new contributor is if

00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,230
you're a new contributor you're normally

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:15,240
contributing a new package these get

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,370
reviewed very thoroughly by the sponsor

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
trying to help you upload them and they

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,360
will often get reams and reams of

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,830
feedback and that is daunting and it's

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,120
because the person is reviewing the

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,620
package is trying to help you and make

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,870
you the best maintainer of it that they

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,929
can but it's also a long painful process

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,149
I don't know if there is an easy

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,769
solution to that we don't want to accept

00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:36,659
horrible packages into the archive and

00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:40,080
we want to teach our new maintainence

00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:41,490
through the best job that we can so

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,130
there is going to be some difficulty and

00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,840
it's better it's best to be clear to the

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,610
people that are starting this process

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,169
that it going to have to do a bit of

00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:54,870
work and but once you get through it

00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:58,440
will help you do the best you can well

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:02,450
from from what I've seen I think the one

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,399
of the frequent complaints about

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:08,279
sponsoring being being a pain is that

00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,559
these don't check very often many duties

00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,600
don't don't check at all this list of

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,080
pending packages so for example I don't

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,690
do I don't do it because yeah I'm very

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,000
bad managing my own time and I have a

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,539
fee I mean if I have some free time I

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,399
prefer to make my packages a bit better

00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:31,769
which really needs some logging from

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:34,380
from me but part of this problem is

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,269
because I have I see all of the packages

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,429
from all of the fields that are waiting

00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:40,860
for somebody to upload I know this is

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:43,559
not the buff for this but since you're

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:47,820
taking notes maybe it could be a nice

00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:50,909
addition that a a prospective packages

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,220
to be included via mentors were to be

00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:56,580
categorized by something like the dev

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,919
tax system so there can be a matching if

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,179
somebody uploads a package a package to

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,440
be mentored a the the developers who are

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:09,010
maintaining similar packages can

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,190
we noticed a expressly there is some

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,630
work going on with the mentors there are

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,820
a bunch of google Summer of Code

00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:18,280
students and lots of other people who

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,250
are working on Deb Expo and doing that

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,690
sort of matching and stuff so yeah I'm a

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,360
genius yeah

00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:28,630
late genius I think there will be an

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:36,520
announcement about when the features are

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:39,190
fully implemented so it's 12:30 yeah

00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,620
here Laney mentions we should get less

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:45,820
mentors and more packaging teams that's

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,550
also I mean many of the teams have a

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,710
working on have become great doors to

00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,890
welcome new developers to get them

00:30:50,710 --> 00:31:02,100
involved and to avoid them having to

00:30:53,890 --> 00:31:04,420
wait for mentorship okay um so it's

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,910
12:30 now maybe we should move on to the

00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:11,640
stuff that demeans doing for derivatives

00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:15,600
yes unless anyone's got other issues or

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,600
positive things to bring up

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:30,000
you know I just want to ask about the

00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:32,299
now that there's this extra effort to

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,360
involve derivatives and the

00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:38,460
communication back to to upstream for

00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,890
many of the packages and and what

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,020
upstream needs to be aware of now that

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,450
these extra efforts are going on whether

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,370
this is relevant in any way for release

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,350
states like obviously different

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:54,360
derivatives are releasing on different

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:56,640
schedules that can impact when it should

00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,950
upstream be releasing and there are

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,440
probably other issues as well in things

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,360
are communicated you could have

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,669
different derivatives pulling upstream

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:11,460
in different directions in a worst-case

00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:15,080
scenario so I guess there isn't really

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,909
any sort of coordination with

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,640
communicating between debian derivatives

00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:23,760
in upstream it's more like individual

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,820
maintained as a involved in the upstream

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,900
project in their community and they

00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,809
informed people about their release

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,970
dates and whatnot so yeah there's

00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:35,659
nothing there's no coordination of that

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,429
sort of thing at the moment maybe that's

00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:43,700
something we could work on within the

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:43,700
context of the Debian derivatives stuff

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:10,600
yeah do you want to add something to the

00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Hobby about that library more about your

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:19,980
ideas and we'll move on to the next

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:23,049
stuff okay so for those who don't know

00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,299
this we Debian has a number of

00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:27,070
initiatives reaching out to our

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:30,130
derivatives and try and bring them back

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:32,679
closer to Debian and giving them space

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,470
to collaborate with each other the first

00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,910
one is the Debian derivatives front desk

00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:40,290
mailing list is a channel for

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:44,140
discussions about issues and

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,940
coordination and other things it's not

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,419
particularly active at the moment but

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,860
yeah it's a good place to get help if

00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:53,350
you need help

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:58,299
coordinating with Debian or discussing

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:59,890
issues and trying it and figuring out

00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:06,250
how to get involved with Debian that

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:09,270
sort of thing so there's if you're

00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:12,010
involved in Debian you can help us help

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:17,800
derivatives join the list and is a

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:25,330
channel so the next project that Debian

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:31,000
is working on is Dex this is had pretty

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:34,210
limited work so far the first the main

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,540
thing that happened was a review of a

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,490
bunch of Ubuntu old patches and all of

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,710
those were successfully merged or

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,389
rejected and reviewed and all that sort

00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:49,270
of thing that was all that worked pretty

00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:53,220
well but more recently more recently

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:56,020
there hasn't been much work on Dex and I

00:34:53,220 --> 00:35:00,750
think maybe we need some infrastructure

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:05,590
stuff set up to make that easier and

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:09,880
working the next thing is the derivative

00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:12,400
census this is my pet project hasn't

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,460
really been any contributions from other

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,080
people apart from

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,540
excellent people have registered in the

00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,830
census and maintain their census pages

00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:28,490
so the way it works is each derivative

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:30,580
has a representative and they come to

00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:35,570
the Debian wiki and create a wiki page

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:40,940
click that button up there and then they

00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:47,090
fill out a wiki page with some data

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:49,100
let's click on the abundant one so here

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,310
we have a whole bunch of data about

00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:56,660
Ubuntu that can be useful to Debian

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:57,380
developers and other derivatives as well

00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,930
of course

00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,960
so for Debian maintainer sees that

00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,770
there's a patch for some package in

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Ubuntu and they want to go and ask

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,720
someone about it they can look at this

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,270
information and find out different

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,930
things about a Bunter and all the stuff

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:20,720
and part of that is the sources the list

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:30,410
of the derivative and so from that

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:32,690
sources dot list we go to we we download

00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:35,930
all those source packages and we create

00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:40,640
patches so that the derivatives

00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:44,420
themselves don't have to do it Ubuntu

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,260
has done that for their packages already

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,420
but it makes sense to do it dirty wide

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,910
rather than every derivative having to

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,910
re-implement that system what

00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:13,710
gotta not do typos so dispatches and

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,269
[Music]

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:19,329
yeah these are this is generated on the

00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:20,950
snapshot Dino dog machine which has the

00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:25,000
whole history of the Devon project every

00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,589
source package every binder package and

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,319
there's a lot of this stuff is not

00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:31,450
really ready for consumption by Devon

00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:36,099
direct had developers yet there are some

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:40,950
limitations yeah and I'm slowly working

00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:43,150
on that to improve them so the next

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:50,170
project that we have is the derivative

00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:52,589
guidelines I should go back to the other

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,589
ones

00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:06,119
so the other thing about the census is

00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:07,559
the integration of the information

00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,990
that's gathered through these wiki pages

00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:14,670
into the Debian infrastructure the first

00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,559
thing that I did was planet Debian

00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,359
derivatives which just aggregates all

00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,660
the blogs of all the derivatives into

00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:24,059
one planet and I'm reading that and I'm

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,210
finding it really useful so I encourage

00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,500
people to just subscribe to it too and

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,500
then you can contact people who are

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,970
doing interesting things that was the

00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,569
first thing and then the second thing

00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:41,460
was the patches stuff we've also

00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:45,150
integrated the Debian into we've also

00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,309
integrated bug linkages into the wiki so

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,289
if you link to a bug you can tell

00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:52,470
whether it's closed or not just by

00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:57,150
looking at the wiki there are some other

00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:58,769
ideas for integrating stuff into the

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,259
Debian infrastructure like you DD

00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:04,710
packages not Damon no but I haven't

00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:07,079
worked in on any of that stuff yet so

00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:09,029
the next I should go on to the next

00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,940
project this is the derivatives

00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:15,109
guidelines it's basically a how-to for

00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:19,339
running a derivative and ways in which

00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:22,410
Debian would like derivatives to operate

00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:26,730
so it includes things like changing

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:31,640
branding repositories gearing's of

00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:34,619
course the Debian trademark branding and

00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:37,019
popcorn and all sorts of stuff so it's

00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:40,680
it's a good resource and if you have

00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:46,339
questions about it or suggestions please

00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:51,359
bring that up on the mailing list and

00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:54,990
here we have some links about derivative

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,259
stuff so if anyone has any more

00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:04,279
questions I think that's the end we've

00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:04,279
got five minutes four minutes

00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:24,230
so so one of the topics in your cabinet

00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:26,210
was branding and artwork so this the

00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,180
cycle I did some work on the desktop

00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,800
base package which includes all the

00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,820
usual artwork like the Plymouth theme

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,530
and gnome and KDE themes and it seems to

00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,480
contain pretty much all over Debian

00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,770
branding so if you want to know if

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,330
they've been branding it seems like all

00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,850
that you need to do is replace this with

00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:48,200
something else so I'm not really sure

00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:50,060
what the exact issue and that is desktop

00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,680
base is one of the packages there are

00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,940
other packages that include their own

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,290
Debian logo or something so this is one

00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,930
of the initiatives we should do for

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,030
Weezy plus one is look at what exactly

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,710
we need to do to get rid of all that

00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,330
stuff and separate it out into a

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,330
separate package yeah

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:44,750
anything else yes I have a question for

00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:47,150
can I'm a developers me currently Debian

00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:55,490
is not fully translated to to Spanish

00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:58,990
and and maybe for canaima they they did

00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:01,490
some work in translation to the

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,250
requirements of of the stopping

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:09,260
government schools and more

00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:12,290
is it possible to to contribute that

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:26,050
translations and that material to Debian

00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:26,050
is there a plan for that or we have

00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:36,410
strong because in this moment the

00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:41,570
Venezuela government have support for

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:47,000
free software movement ok and we are and

00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:51,680
we are working you get a lot of project

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:59,270
for try to get funds for work for free

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,869
for free software activity okay but we

00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:08,170
need

00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:12,760
okay we need work in infrastructure for

00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:19,480
make more easy this collaboration okay

00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,480
for example in canaima we have a lot

00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:29,920
production ok of a translation service

00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:35,930
translation for software for example

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:40,030
report report report book ng is a weak

00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:44,630
tool but the interface is in English ok

00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:49,690
the same little project for get this

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,690
tool in Spanish Fork and i'ma firstly

00:43:53,890 --> 00:44:08,680
okay so we need a get way for sure

00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,680
before between the Debian thing spanish

00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:16,280
debian thing spanish translation and

00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:23,980
canal this is a greek job this is a we

00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:27,349
project work okay I have a question

00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:33,770
we're starting to do the collaboration

00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:37,400
so the way that translations are given

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:43,010
to Devon is not not the same as packages

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:47,170
right there is a team so we'll just have

00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:51,320
to integrate to that team

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:53,540
so for Spanish this is the language for

00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,160
translation stuff right you can join the

00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:59,320
length they list and introduce

00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:03,050
yourselves and get involved of course no

00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:06,050
christian Perea is here he's the Debian

00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,730
installer coordinator for translation

00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:11,450
stuff you should probably talk to him

00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:14,540
why are you here so I think

00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:17,270
turns up if you want to talk to me about

00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:20,570
derivative stuff during deaf conf just

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,960
come and say hi and thanks for everyone

00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,960
for coming

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,819
