okay welcome this is the use pearl bath

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:12,990
for Def Con 12 and we're online

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:17,840
I believe the IRC online which we had up

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,910
earlier is Deb Kampf talk room too and

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:28,460
it's being the stuff is being met by

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,460
Herman and yeah welcome thank you

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,690
well it's kind of administrivia okay for

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,000
everybody across the world Gregor and I

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,730
are discussing which IRC channel we

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,129
should direct people to I think we

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:54,309
should use one of them and not both okay

00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:56,949
so I guess most people aren't even let

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,170
let's use Debian pearls so that random

00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:06,100
people wandering by might actually be

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:08,440
interested I will do that for those of

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:15,780
you and Gulen bots are this is me

00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:21,009
signing off good

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,770
bienvenidos Hey when we need us no there

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:28,229
are no women atleast in the room maybe

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:33,460
oh there's a one can tree women oh good

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:38,770
so I'm confused okay so this is the the

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:42,790
pearl buff more like annual real life

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:44,619
meeting after debian group for those

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,320
following at home the debian pearl group

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:52,829
is one of the oldest and one of the

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:55,450
largest teams in Debian large both in

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,570
membership although we're not sure about

00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:04,659
how many members are really active but

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:07,539
there are some 200 people some 200

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,850
people in the earliest project large

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,720
also a number of packages I think at the

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:18,070
moment we have something like 2,300

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,650
packages in git repositories that's

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,070
about I guess 200 more than last year

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,989
something like that yeah

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:31,780
they are just increasing yeah what we

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,290
should check in the beginning is who

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,260
cares about IRC you think that's David

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,500
already and it would be very great if

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,080
someone could take some notes and send

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,750
them as minutes to the list afterwards

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,520
thank you Tim

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,520
good and Oh

00:02:52,290 --> 00:03:04,060
is this about my volume about a

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:05,680
microphone volume oh sorry I guess I was

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:11,260
just relaying from my ear see that

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,840
people cannot hear you well okay I tried

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,740
to speak a bit louder which is not so

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:23,280
easy at 10 in the morning at the same

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:29,440
volume he's saying that it's your volume

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,940
okay okay yeah I'll be quiet now anyway

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,640
I think it would be nice for people

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,440
watching at home to know our names so

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,800
that they can relate the names or the

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,680
nicknames today to the faces so maybe we

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,360
could start with a very short

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,360
introduction round see

00:03:49,379 --> 00:04:16,829
yeah maybe if you want to start just say

00:03:52,689 --> 00:04:20,669
your name hi hi my name is Sarah Doran

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:24,970
I'm member of the per group since 2009

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:31,690
doing the regular work updating package

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:33,250
bug fixes I'm Daniel dkg I don't

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,610
remember what year it was that I

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,800
officially put my name in the alley auth

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,949
project and I haven't been particularly

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,810
active but I'm happy to do the little

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,250
bit that I do and very happy that

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,330
everybody it's part of this project

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,699
I am tincho Mallory my name I've been

00:04:49,330 --> 00:05:00,840
not working in the group since something

00:04:51,699 --> 00:05:00,840
like 2006 hi I'm Tim Gleason I see

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,090
I'm man scar and well recently I haven't

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,460
been that active in the pod roof because

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,449
well I've been doing other things in

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,630
Debian like running the FTP team and

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,310
yeah

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:26,639
I've also written the current version of

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:33,690
PT sir I'm David Bremner and I forget

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:36,900
also but I think 2008-9 I know none of

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:41,490
us so Kusanagi asks on IRC does anybody

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:44,820
do something in Perl and well gregor

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,750
does that that much is clear and and

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,699
actually a bunch of people make packages

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,820
for Gregor to upload which is really

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:58,650
great but not all of them are here

00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:02,009
unfortunately and I guess my main

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,460
contribution to the program is get

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:07,199
troubleshooter these days so any kind of

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,990
get problems people should feel free to

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:16,259
bug me about them well get problems in

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:19,050
the program anyway so I'll just comment

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,599
on that as well in terms of it's not

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,469
clear what the question was about doing

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,949
something in Perl

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,750
I know many of us are packagers but we

00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:30,150
also are users of Perl which is why

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,650
we're interested in packaging it so I

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,259
think a lot of people do actually write

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,060
stuff in Perl as well but this is more

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,650
about packaging and maintaining thrall

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:45,270
with in debian so I don't need to go

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:47,780
into much detail no just just let's

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,780
finish to

00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:58,339
yeah but you have not ah it is gone

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:03,809
right good

00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:08,009
it's terminal is he okay

00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:12,499
is he ready for the big thing I might be

00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,499
might be nice thing to finish

00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:32,009
I'm just asking Daniel on IRC if he's

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:36,199
ready to to delete SVN and he's welcome

00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,199
to interpret that as broadly as he likes

00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:45,869
so I I made a small joke because to

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,209
delete SVN could be interpreted quite

00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:55,680
broadly especially with ftp assistant

00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:58,559
sitting beside me but no response from

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,399
the seaside okay it might be a nice

00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:05,219
thing to finish off okay anyway we'll do

00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:10,110
it at the end of the Bob right okay it's

00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:13,619
a kind of celebration so what we have

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:18,709
here is this open tasks page which we

00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:24,749
have cleaned up before that conf and

00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:26,999
last week during an informal meeting we

00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:29,279
now have I think two sections we should

00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:33,209
look at when one is this policy

00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:38,939
discussion sections with three items we

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:42,599
should decide upon and well then there's

00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:48,449
lots of stuff about transitions packages

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:52,399
tools specific tools recurring tasks and

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:55,800
whatever and that you would be not to

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,259
maybe spend five minutes on each of them

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,769
because we don't have this time but to

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,190
find some priorities or to get to some

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:07,750
kind of road

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:10,150
what we want to do next year what are

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,970
the important ones that we want to

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:17,040
tackle next year and which other ones

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:22,210
are just nice if someone cares about it

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:26,860
so if we start at the top the policy and

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:28,630
discussion things well which one do we

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,590
take let's start with the last one

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:35,620
that's an easy one the the third one is

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,900
the question about adding a paragraph

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:42,340
about how we handle their being

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:45,400
copyright in our packages in fact we

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,670
were using corporate format 1.0 since

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,040
well we've used various iterations of

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,590
type 5 before but it's nowhere written

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,710
down so the idea came up to to write it

00:09:53,590 --> 00:10:01,120
down so laura has proposed wording for

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:05,380
it and sent it to the list yeah maybe

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,840
you could clarify the state yeah and I

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,840
got some feedback from Gabe Gregor and

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,970
there was a one open point if the last

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,660
sentence about the generic or where else

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,210
should be left out but I think if all

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,540
agree on the current X we can commit

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,690
this way and then adjust it later on if

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,570
needed mm-hmm since it's so short maybe

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:40,090
you can just read the current text so

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:43,360
that everyone yes it again so the

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:46,150
current text says each package should

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,640
have the copyright fight even copyright

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:53,760
following the copyright format one zero

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,890
or newer and copyright format one no

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,210
a310s released together with even policy

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:03,480
3 9 trees documented at the well

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:07,120
pointing

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,720
all release copyright specifications can

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,490
be found under than the generic which is

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,620
a directory listing yeah okay so from

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:22,810
the people here in the room are down any

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,940
further comments on this get such as

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:49,990
documentation of what we are actually

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:52,060
doing you mean

00:11:49,990 --> 00:12:00,670
maintain us that the corporate hold us

00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:02,980
for Debian slash that's not optional so

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,279
it should complete include the for

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,770
copyright information what I think was

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:16,810
made optional is listing the maintained

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:18,760
s who initially created the package you

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,380
mean this this sentence this package was

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,649
there be an iced which is not a word

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,570
anyway yes by someone in 1900 that

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:34,029
doesn't really matter for copyright

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:41,440
information rather I think it's not even

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:44,950
in the Indus if ocation anymore okay so

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,040
it's there anything on IRC related to

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:53,529
this question nothing so I guess we can

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:56,010
consider this decided and any what's the

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,779
word in English for everyone agrees

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,620
consensus no the other world consensus

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,620
the one with

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:11,470
no that that adjective for everyone

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:13,630
agrees and any Union immunity there

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,690
appears to be unanimity great room

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,120
we are unanimous right that's the word

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,540
thank you okay cool so Salvador I can't

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:28,750
just merge and push or whatever is

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:33,670
commit good the one before sounds also

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,950
not so really difficult the question

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:40,210
about which branch names to use in our

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:42,640
git repositories for I guess it was for

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:46,150
back ports of testing proposed updates

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,370
and well suffer non-standard

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,950
for everything else besides my sapristi

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,680
massive esteemed island and upstream it

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:57,940
would be nice to use the same branch

00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:05,560
names I'm not sure do we have a proposal

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:08,440
already what I have used so far for all

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,920
packages is just the release code name

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,660
sir usually squeeze HFC - which

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,470
interestingly has the branch name to

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:21,430
squeeze freeze which is more like an

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,070
arrow but we kept it and well for

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:28,000
backwaters would then just be squeezed -

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:31,270
backwards yes the only problematic thing

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,060
is I think using experimental problems -

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,360
experimental because it's more like a

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,970
temporarily branch so basically you

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,440
upload to experimental and do something

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,150
else maybe or drop the entire line and

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,750
then something else ends up saying

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:56,530
experimental later which is should not

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:59,140
be on the same branch probably so what

00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:02,320
would what would be a good way to handle

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,050
uploads to experimental not sure so for

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,880
actually see life was an experimental

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:12,490
for a while which is the 2.3 series and

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,680
I just used the master branch because I

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,230
intended to move it to unstable later

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,460
anyway

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,460
[Music]

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,100
I guess I don't see a problem with using

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,009
the word experimental as a branch name

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,009
even if a future experimental doesn't

00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:33,589
come off the same line you can always

00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:36,949
just put a tag on the version that was

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:42,139
uploaded and then move the branch to be

00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:44,269
some totally different branch the branch

00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,449
itself is non fast-forward yes that's

00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,449
right

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:59,300
for experimental I don't really care

00:15:52,519 --> 00:16:04,069
that it's not fast forward one thing is

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,139
that right now most our tools to some

00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:09,050
automatic tooth perhaps work on the

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,629
master branch as the place where the

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:17,899
most current version of the code and

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:20,480
packaging are so one requirement I don't

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:24,379
know how it effects the proposals we

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:28,279
have at hand at least we should make

00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:31,970
this clear we need to always need we

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:35,209
need to have motion stuff in in the

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,670
master branch at in time not differ from

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,920
it in the experimental branch that would

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:47,509
be more up-to-date that man master I

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:51,139
think is this a PE T requirement or what

00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:55,879
tools need things on specific branches

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:59,299
and whose author should be punished that

00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:03,049
author PT doesn't really care though it

00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:04,760
displays the current head by default but

00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:07,120
you could tell it to display something

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,120
else

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,499
well another point is if we fork

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:18,959
experimental branch earthmaster and do

00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:23,039
the work he there during the freeze

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:29,399
what's master lunch for right now it

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:33,299
becomes useless the master branch could

00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:36,659
be used if there's if our sea bugs come

00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,360
up in the package that can't be dealt

00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:41,249
with in the newer vert

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:47,580
about the newer version well you can fix

00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:50,340
those bugs in the master so that would

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,720
be for our bugs we can fix for going

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,570
through and step all right okay and for

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,580
bugs we cannot fix by going through and

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:05,029
stable the that would be a wheezy branch

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,029
okay fine with me

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,929
the only problem I see is that as much

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,769
as I remember how pet is still working

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:18,840
which I'm not so sure but you always

00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:22,860
have a default branch of following so

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,029
these things like mental or some

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,830
proposal uploads branch will not be

00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:32,070
properly reported in pet so maybe we

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,200
will need to do some extra support for

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,039
London it was also promised since the

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,299
very beginning with better well it's a

00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,590
problem that we have mainly because

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:45,749
we've successfully migrated to two gay

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:50,899
right I mean we didn't have the problem

00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,899
because we weren't okay

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:57,560
well um it doesn't sound like there's

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:01,280
any concern with just odds gosh proposal

00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:04,880
of just using just using the release

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,030
names right right look using the code

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,430
names and so for the proposed updates

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:17,420
that's going to be squeezed - proposed -

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:19,460
updates just squeeze squeeze proposed

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,620
updates this anyway just some Elias for

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,110
squeeze no actually the other way around

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:29,770
but I usually use just squeeze and

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,770
uploads and it ends up there anyway sir

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:42,190
okay so branch names release names and

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,190
this experimental versus master stuff

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:57,410
I'm not sure but it seemed the consensus

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,270
was that master was for unstable that we

00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,990
essentially had some mental map of

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:08,750
branches

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:12,740
to sweets okay just want to relay from

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:19,960
IRC that Jonas is asking for short names

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,960
please write shorter than squeeze school

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:27,650
first let after release name okay so

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:33,320
that's it

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:36,530
cool yeah and the first point is about

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,360
how do we deal with the stay with the

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,650
stated we are frozen

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:47,059
so shall we upload new stuff to unstable

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:49,309
or not or experimental or whatever two

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,160
years ago we were sitting this huge

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:57,500
auditorium I mean at Columbia University

00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:01,340
in New York we decided that we will in

00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:04,970
general go on and upload new upstream

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,549
releases to unstable just because we

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,830
have something like between five or ten

00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:13,970
of them but per day and it doesn't scale

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:15,770
to to stop work for half a year and and

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,190
then find a huge pile of I don't know

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:24,620
how many hundred packages after six

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:28,640
months with the exception that we tried

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:33,200
to be well a bit careful meaning not

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:38,650
uploading yeah core packages which have

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:43,100
many reverse dependencies which already

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,080
had packs have needed more care in the

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,490
last year's so we did not upload

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,440
something like lip TV hype stuff like

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,570
that and I think it worked out quite

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,710
quite well I think we had to go through

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,559
testing proposed updates for two

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,710
packages and

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,529
well the rest was was fine after the

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,360
freeze when the migration was activated

00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:08,429
again there was something like between

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,789
four and five hundred packages migrating

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:13,830
in 20 so yeah it's the question do we

00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,019
want to make it to do it the same this

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,269
time or something differently but this

00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,940
is not in conflict with what the listing

00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:24,629
was saying yesterday not allowed to

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:31,860
unstable if it's going to go if it's not

00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:35,129
going to go into I guess it it might be

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,340
and we could make our plan tentative on

00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:41,549
the release team not telling us that

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,789
that's a terrible plan we could also

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,080
find someone from the release team and

00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:53,429
get there and get their permission to

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:55,200
say this is we could I mean if we can we

00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,330
could just find somebody here and say

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,309
hey this is our plan this is how it

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:05,159
works two years ago and we would like to

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:08,129
continue that way well what i shortly

00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:11,730
taught yesterday yesterday informal

00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:15,269
informally with adam and told him yeah

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:20,669
we would like to do that again this way

00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:24,320
so it seems it's okay so as soon as long

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:28,950
we respect this rule not to update

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:32,669
critic critical packages which we know

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,220
are mm-hm thank you

00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,559
the large problem with updating packages

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:41,369
and unstable you the freeze suspense be

00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:43,320
that it can affect other packages so the

00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:47,369
obvious case is the library where you

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:51,169
change the surname then every dependency

00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:54,690
will not be able to be updated through

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:57,809
through unstable the same happens if you

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,110
just add symbols in the library and they

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:03,720
are actually used by other packages then

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:05,029
this is a problem we have not have that

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,740
much was Berlitz

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,860
only when the API changes in

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,160
incompatible ways and the suggestion was

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,440
anyway too

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,440
not upload these changes as possible

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:28,200
okay so I'm just going to ask IRC for

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,200
comments

00:24:53,049 --> 00:25:00,519
two people on IRC say it's great so it

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:03,100
must be great okay cool then let's stick

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,610
to it and thanks again Salvatori for

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:11,049
asking

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:15,100
Adam it makes it safer good so we have

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:18,460
decided everything and we have almost 20

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:25,450
minutes to go to the next step to all

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:27,759
the ideas tasks whatever we want to any

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:32,580
priority two in three would you like to

00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,580
take it one do you want a headset

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:08,509
well - worse okay fine so first of all

00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:12,049
perhaps it's time to ask if any anyone

00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:15,889
here has something that should be

00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:18,769
discussed in person that would be and

00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:28,570
that was not in the list we had in the

00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:34,580
wiki looks like it's not the case fine

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:40,190
so what I would love us to do right now

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:43,359
is to pick one or a few action items

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:48,739
from our huge to-do list

00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:52,249
appendix page in the wiki and and say

00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:57,440
okay this one we single it out and we

00:26:52,249 --> 00:27:00,200
will really like to to to be able to to

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:05,839
erase it from our to-do lists before

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:09,950
next year's DEP Kampf for example there

00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:12,499
are a few relatively big tasks such I

00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:15,320
think mainly the ones that we have a

00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:19,219
hard time dealing with are the ones that

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:23,899
require writing on our maintaining our

00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:29,869
own software and tools such as the H Mac

00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:34,269
per package check and bet and there has

00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:38,809
not much there has not been that much

00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:42,339
work done that specific topics list here

00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,339
I think sorry

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,499
so my proposal would be to pick only one

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:56,570
of these three ones and say that

00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:59,179
realistically we won't work that much on

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:02,539
our three at the same time so we could

00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:05,960
perhaps just pick one and say okay how

00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:10,070
do we make things happen and package

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:13,389
check or on the bed or whatever as

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,389
you're feeling about that

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,990
so you're asking her feedback about if

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,180
people are okay with choosing one and

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:34,790
trying to stick collectively to working

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:36,590
on that one yes well not to stick it

00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:41,000
doesn't prevent anyone from working and

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:46,670
their bit but where I or it has one

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,880
priority is and try together to build

00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,400
some collective dynamics that may be

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:57,590
useful too so that other people get

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,940
motivated didn't start doing stuff to do

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,710
you have in mind

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,650
which of the three you'd like to propose

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:07,820
is the priority personally I don't feel

00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:10,940
I'm competence to to to know which one

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:15,140
is the most important right one right

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,380
now for us for Debian a zoo perhaps pets

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,380
but

00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:33,210
so in our pre buff buff we wondered

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:36,600
about if it would make sense to have pet

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,400
as a debian package and I even thought

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,720
this was a good idea before I realized

00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,090
it was a web application what do you

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,950
think

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:51,690
well I'm sure because not many people

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:53,940
will install it anyway and yes I don't

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:58,680
know how to package web applications

00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:00,930
myself I think almost no one knows how

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,970
to package web applications but there's

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,650
a couple good examples for packaging web

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,770
applications that are in the archive I

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:12,210
actually think that I mean I can I can

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,740
point to some it's not a trivial it's

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,870
not a trivial task but I do think that

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,270
it's worth doing particularly if we can

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,370
do it in a way that we think is good to

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,920
demonstrate how to put a tool that we

00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,710
find useful into the archive I put one

00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,140
of the problems is that should we move

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,280
PT to a yurt like we planned

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,930
last year but haven't done much about it

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,660
then we wouldn't be able to use the

00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:39,600
package ourselves DAC for example has a

00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,730
similar problem because well sometimes

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,280
we are thinking about it would be nice

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,400
to have a package for it but we probably

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:51,600
wouldn't use it ourselves

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:54,330
why because we cannot install packages

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,520
on Eliot ourselves we would always

00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:02,340
forever change need to go to the alert

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:04,050
administrators so who are the Ali Earth

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,090
administrators and why would they be

00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,950
resistant if we if we demonstrate that

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:12,120
we have decent packaging standards and

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:15,270
we and we make sure to backport the

00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,310
package that we want to squeeze why

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:20,970
would that that seems like a good thing

00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:24,180
to do on the other hand there's always

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:27,630
the possibility to use the package dash

00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,470
X to extract it to a directory and use

00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,350
it from there

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,030
so you are almost using the packages you

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,690
are not using the maintainer scripts

00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,789
that come with it

00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,070
you're using the stuff that is actually

00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:44,739
within the package and I think that

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:47,529
would be a compromise is that much

00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:50,409
different than not packaging it because

00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:53,259
you don't use the directional layout or

00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,649
Apache configuration that the package

00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:59,019
would ship and it's going through the

00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:01,299
earlier that means well the main problem

00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:03,580
I see is that it's causing more work for

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:06,249
them because we always have to block

00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,759
them to install things the work that

00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:12,759
we're asking of them is can you apt-get

00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,429
update apt-get install that slash

00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:20,080
squeeze backwards right which is not a

00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,889
big task yeah but you cannot fiddle with

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,830
it

00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:30,999
the live systems and which people

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:33,159
sometimes do it's possibility I think

00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:37,840
packaging it would slow down development

00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:40,149
okay you can hear me if if the main

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,009
reason for packaging it is to get a bug

00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:46,720
tracker is there any possibility we get

00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:50,019
a virtual package to file bugs against

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,529
pet anyway oh well technically there's

00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:54,940
the Aleut request tracker but I don't

00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:58,389
really like it myself

00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,869
okay but that's that's awful so that we

00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:08,639
could surely talk to the books people

00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:12,519
and whoever and and get pet tops virtual

00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:18,099
probably yes but I think Don would like

00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:20,440
to do so only for Debian dog services so

00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:23,919
we wouldn't need to move to Debian doc

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,679
first and install it I was going to such

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,049
as exactly that I think it doesn't make

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,059
much sense the effort of packaging and

00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,159
keeping it in a package installed in the

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:36,789
machine etc just for the bug reporting I

00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:40,179
think if we want bug reporting Soto bug

00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:43,179
is a lot better and regarding the the

00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:46,509
thing about using it using as a packaged

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:48,879
application it's good if you want to

00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:50,289
to not be developing all the time in

00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:53,079
life system which is usually a good idea

00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:55,389
but also at the same time the

00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,889
congressional pet is not really it's

00:33:55,389 --> 00:34:00,609
probably not really useful for anybody

00:33:56,889 --> 00:34:01,929
who's not Debian I mean not know you're

00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:03,999
not going to store it in your personal

00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:09,129
machine product so maybe it doesn't make

00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:11,500
much sense to spend a fortune that it at

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,599
least maybe it shouldn't be a priority

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,200
which was where we started this

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:22,960
discussion and I think if somebody wants

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,179
to package it then great but yeah I also

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,740
wanted to say I think the question about

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:32,669
pet is more that we as a group heavily

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,259
rely on it but the fact though it's only

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:38,289
written maintained by an scam mostly

00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:41,529
because it's in right so I think the

00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:44,710
question about pet is more hard do we

00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:50,500
get more people involved to help out

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:53,139
answer apart

00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:57,670
Parker tracking there's not only the

00:34:53,139 --> 00:35:00,730
possibilities of using le earth or box

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,130
Divya knock but there also some

00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:06,099
standalone things like simple defects

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:10,779
which would blend in to the version

00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:14,740
control system it always depends on who

00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:18,759
you think might be reporting back and

00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:22,829
who you want to report back so maybe

00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:22,829
think about other possibilities too

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,580
well if you want to install or our own

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,100
backtracking software would need to run

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,900
on Elliott and I'm not sure if

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,730
installing we have applications there is

00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:42,540
a great idea because I have already seen

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:46,150
some groups using totally outdated

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,850
wiki's which had security issues and

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,860
very basically full of spam simple it

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,960
effects is not a web application it

00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,010
blends directly into the version control

00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:00,270
system so it's directly with the code we

00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:03,190
have the box next to the code and it's

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:06,970
distributed back tracking system throw

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:10,270
that okay that would be fine with me but

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:15,520
the problems always well people need to

00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:19,300
use it so I will say also in having a

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,850
nice system as the BTS I wonder if it

00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,740
makes any sense to study a new tool I am

00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:29,290
pretty sure it's not such a big deal to

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:33,030
have another versatile package in in

00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:36,160
fact mentors dot DB n dot net is already

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,950
an example of a non Debian dot org

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,060
service which which is got a pseudo

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:47,800
package and well world sponsorship

00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:51,310
requests okay it's not about the service

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,930
I don't know that this is the best that

00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,580
is the best we can we just need to go

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:58,000
find on and talk to him about it

00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,859
I agree so if we if we think that a

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,020
pseudo package is the right so should we

00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:03,730
pursue a sort of package at least see if

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,930
Donn likes the idea

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:13,660
I volunteer to do that it's done then

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:19,029
[Music]

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:22,269
backtracking is sorted out qu and well

00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:24,400
we belt pet and despaired we have

00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:29,019
packaging so we have discussed this

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,869
already we have some infrastructure

00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:35,619
issues about who has access to the pet

00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:38,319
that runs the box that runs pet and who

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:43,720
is allowed to restarted when it needs

00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:48,309
some hand messaging and what could be

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:52,569
done to solve this next year there

00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:55,059
that's mostly moving to area again or

00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:57,730
people asking me to get access I think

00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:04,150
that two members of the per group who

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:06,460
have access surprised it well and I

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,289
think well there's also a database alone

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:12,250
if you want to access that you can also

00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:16,289
to ask me and I can well allow

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,289
connecting over the net from a static IP

00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:28,269
just a bit from the past we used to have

00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:30,160
an automatic post coming hope that will

00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:33,460
export the files when there was a change

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,619
and put it life immediately that can be

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,390
done with a branch so it's not immediate

00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:39,309
so you can have a development branch and

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,339
a stable branch and they have automatic

00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:44,319
scripts that avoid the need of having

00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:47,019
somebody to have permission in the

00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:50,200
machine etc well there's also a

00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:52,960
development version on the host which is

00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,240
actually PT - devil Debian don't net

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,339
which currently runs the same code it's

00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,900
for testing out new things in the web

00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:06,359
interface so it's easier sometimes when

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,359
you can just change think there

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:18,030
and currently this issue that scanning

00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:25,980
watch files sometimes hangs so you need

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:29,610
to kill the process behind so to submit

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:32,790
to p2 / two members of the group have

00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:36,840
the can do that actually to already

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:41,060
start it by hand right cool it is a big

00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,060
secret to tell who they are so that

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,750
Salvatore I just raised his hand so I

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:56,340
suspected he's one of them yeah he's one

00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:59,490
of them so if we feel it's enough to

00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:01,620
solve the probably this was a non-issue

00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:09,990
then and we can just drop it from the

00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:13,050
list looks like five and the last part

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:19,530
of this about pets and this page was

00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:22,770
about adding new features so well one

00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:26,550
thing is probably to list new features

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:33,900
we would need here in a way that they

00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:37,470
can be prioritized and them we don't

00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:40,950
like the BTS probably yes probably and

00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:49,080
then finding actual people to do the

00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:51,210
work I have no idea how our very

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,310
original pet developer feels about

00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:57,570
adding new features acting as a

00:40:53,310 --> 00:41:01,260
maintainer would review pull requests

00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:03,960
some people would send or if for example

00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,860
if we find someone from say the Haskell

00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:11,220
group and hence a a we use pets - we

00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:15,870
need that feature what do I set them

00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:20,730
well what the workflow how how do they

00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:23,530
contribute where I don't have that much

00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,440
time for PT myself apparently so

00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:28,690
working with other things but I'm fine

00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,800
with merging changes and reviewing them

00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,300
and well and then handing off full

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,390
permissions to other people as well I

00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:40,270
think it's hosted on Elliott already so

00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:48,580
you can comment there if you're a member

00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:51,300
of the PT group okay do you think it

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:57,070
would be a good idea to garage the other

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:59,770
groups we use PE T to ask them a do you

00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:02,320
have there are any bugs you suffer from

00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,910
or are features you need do you want to

00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:19,180
help maintaining this piece of software

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:22,000
on staff anyone wants to do that I do we

00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:26,590
only have three minutes left so I think

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,550
we can close the PT chapter on anything

00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,550
left to say

00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:49,170
should I prepare them for his ceremonial

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:51,119
role oh okay maybe one thing that it's

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,670
in the least that might be need to be

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,530
agreed asleep the project member being I

00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,530
don't know if his controversial No

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,470
yeah thanks for reminding us when rainy

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,730
also said we should talk about it and he

00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:14,770
is not here

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:19,030
the idea to ping inactive members which

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:24,160
you and I have done at one point should

00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:27,280
we do it again maybe some intervals I'm

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:31,990
not sure the problem was that I actually

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,510
did not finish that I think I have

00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:37,780
somewhere file but it's now totally

00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:40,660
outdated so I did ping them and some

00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,530
people replied that they no longer have

00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,470
time or so

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:47,610
some people's that they will do things

00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:50,470
in the future I think some or also have

00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:54,460
but cleaning up their accounts I have

00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:56,470
never done actually yes a question when

00:43:54,460 --> 00:44:04,780
do we want to do this in the future in

00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:07,420
question to who does it if yes so it's a

00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,790
bit difficult to coordinate here cuz

00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,090
damn doesn't have video so he can't tell

00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:17,010
that we're not talking about his project

00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:20,080
right now oh but maybe we should just

00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:23,920
tell them to go ahead with the removal

00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,770
and and all of us who dearly loved SVN

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:32,590
will shed a tear if any such people

00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:34,180
exist okay it's a big celebration of one

00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,940
year after moving from s way in circuit

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:44,730
I'm sitting at the beach in Bulgaria I

00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:48,010
guess will now remove as we I mean right

00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:51,640
DAC RM SVN is later today what nobody's

00:44:48,010 --> 00:45:02,230
looking good so coming back to the

00:44:51,640 --> 00:45:05,500
membership something is it a burden I

00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:07,540
mean it looks a bit funny but he does it

00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,620
cause any practical problems having lots

00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:13,240
of members in the group what are the

00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,370
only practical problem is that

00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:19,240
membership in any Elliot group gives

00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:22,150
shall axis and well I don't think most

00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,060
people mean harm but of course if

00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:29,710
somebody gets access to the account of

00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:32,910
somebody inactive it means that they can

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:35,830
log in on a yacht if they want to or

00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:41,050
when time starts maybe we should discuss

00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:44,320
it on the mailing list later anyway or

00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,030
in the hack lab okay damn says it's

00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:50,410
running now so thank you everyone and

00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:53,790
sorry talk Meister thanks Ian

00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,790
