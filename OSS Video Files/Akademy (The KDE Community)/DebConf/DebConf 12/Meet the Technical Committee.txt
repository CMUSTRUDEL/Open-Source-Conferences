okay it's time so I guess we can start

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,980
next topic is meets the Technical

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,990
Committee that will provide you an

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,490
opportunity to meet the members of the

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,340
Debian Technical Committee that are

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,350
present at that conf here the status of

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,789
the open issues before the committee and

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,090
ask questions about how the committee

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:31,640
works operates and if you have questions

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:34,290
go ahead now is it turned on woohoo okay

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,020
this is intended to be you know more

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,410
buff and less talk certainly we want

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,660
this to be very interactive I grabbed

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,910
the same short set of slides that we

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,149
used for this last year in Banja Luka

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,190
and updated them appropriately and so we

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,460
have very short set of things just to

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,980
provide a little bit of context and to

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,500
get things started and then I firmly

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,789
expect us to transition very quickly

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,689
into discussion and we'll see how things

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,180
go from there so to start with there are

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,930
eight members of the Debian technical

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,080
committee on this list I have coated

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,659
them with italics if they are not here

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,520
so as you can see there are four members

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,119
or half of the technical committee

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,180
present

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm Beatle Garvey I serve as the

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,290
chairman nominal chairman of the

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,909
committee we have Don Armstrong and Ian

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,490
Jackson and Steve Lanka sheykh are also

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,799
here and the other four members as I

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:41,060
mentioned are not able to be here at Deb

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:44,420
conf but that's who we are

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,360
the Debian Technical Committee can

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:51,270
exists because of authority that is

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,369
defined within the Debian Constitution I

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,409
won't go through all the details here

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,630
because as I said this is just the same

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,759
as what we used last year for those of

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,259
you who are not present in Banja Luka at

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,170
dub conf last year if you have any

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,360
questions about the boundaries of the

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,970
technical committees responsibilities

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,500
and authority that's certainly an

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,510
excellent thing for us to take as

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,159
questions and to talk about

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,829
here after we get through this little

00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,930
bit of introductory stuff in the past

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:22,110
the Technical Committee has operated

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,599
almost entirely through bugs being

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,489
reassigned to the technical committees

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,159
pseudo project or pseudo package and

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:34,799
email but recently at the suggestion of

00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,040
Zack we tried something a little new and

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:41,579
a little different of having a live

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,109
meeting on IRC and a majority of the

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:45,030
members of the committee were able to

00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,220
participate and it was actually fairly

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,109
productive so we've had two of these

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,690
meetings now and I think going forward

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:54,030
at least for a while we will try to do

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,159
these on something like a monthly basis

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,900
and if it turns out that's too

00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,180
frequently maybe we'll back off at some

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,379
point but for now we're trying to do

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,750
that and if you're interested in joining

00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,730
in and watching are those discussions

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,069
those you're certainly welcome to do so

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,139
and if you watch the committee's mailing

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,579
list that's probably the best way to see

00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,699
or when they're happening and be

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,699
reminded of them so for the exciting

00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:24,000
part the good the bad and the ugly on

00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,799
the positive side there are fewer open

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,230
bugs before the tech committee this year

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,699
than there were last year and of the

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,590
three that I've mentioned here the first

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,959
one is actually in the process of being

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,940
voted right now we had a call for votes

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,069
I think was it yesterday Steve on the

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,079
node versus no DJ us and we're in the

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,299
middle of voting on that and so

00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,459
hopefully by the time we conclude here

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,870
at deb conf we will have heard from

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,930
enough folks to know what the outcome of

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,579
that is the second bug that's open

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,799
against the committee right now for our

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:57,329
shame i did not have to edit from last

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,760
year's slides we'll talk about that and

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,449
then the final one is actually in some

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,780
sense not a very big deal except to us

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:10,229
but there is an issue a fencepost issue

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,659
in the constitution right now around the

00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,239
definition of supermajority for votes

00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:18,750
that the technical committee is taking

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,060
and ian is working right now on exactly

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,400
what the right text should be for

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,540
changing that and that has led us to an

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,030
interesting sort of sequence of this

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,220
questions around the process by which

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,640
the Technical Committee might propose

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,890
and run general resolutions this has

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,390
been part of the authority that the

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,940
Technical Committee has under the

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,050
Constitution for a long time but it's

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,020
the best of my knowledge we've never

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,420
actually exercised this before so it's

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,180
led to some interesting conversation so

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,250
with that this is really sort of all I

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,780
had in the way of providing context and

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,910
it's now time for us to talk about

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,620
things because I suspect that at least

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,480
some of the confer conversation will

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,760
pertain to them I'll put the list of

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,580
open issues before the committee back up

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,550
and maybe before I completely open up to

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,620
questions I should offer my three

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,560
colleagues here the opportunity each say

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,240
a word or three about the committee and

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,260
what we're currently doing anything like

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,610
that if you'd like to so done I mean I

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,430
don't have anything in particular to say

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,520
just the the meetings on RC we've been

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,590
having the logs are present and in the

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,060
future we'll have the meet bot running

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,160
we actually had it at the last meeting

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,770
but I forgot to run the command to

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,660
invoke the logs so hopefully from now on

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,280
they'll be there I published logs out of

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,110
my own chat clients so hopefully they're

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:43,540
there acceptable but well of course

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:45,550
continue to trying to do that yeah the

00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,960
IRC meetings are working really well I

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:53,350
think based on what's happened so far I

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,180
can say that with much better

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,410
probability if you now reassign a bug to

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,350
the technical committee something might

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,020
happen about it which would be quite a

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:08,980
radical departure and so I'd encourage

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:10,360
people to give that a go yeah so I guess

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,370
I would say I think the one month

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,830
frequency is about right for the

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,930
meetings I think that that has worked

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,210
well a one-month interval is about the

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,070
right amount of time for me to

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,480
procrastinate my action items from the

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,800
previous meeting and then get around to

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,570
having a little bit of time to maybe

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,730
work on them so that's about the right

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:31,920
neg frequency I think for the for an

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,920
ongoing basis for the committee so

00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,300
trying to think of a question okay so so

00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,080
so you have the second one on there and

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,369
Python package maintainer ship

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,839
traditionally the tech committee is

00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:59,739
being very reluctant to decide on

00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,419
essentially between who should be a

00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:03,879
package maintainer when essentially two

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,069
people are are in conflict is is there

00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,189
any particular reason for that

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:13,289
and do you think it's something that the

00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:13,289
tech committee should be ruling on I

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,759
mean from some point of view we are

00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,219
extremely reluctant because all

00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,409
decisions are bad I mean if there's

00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,539
generally there's a problem otherwise we

00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,059
wouldn't be being asked about it and at

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:32,319
some level not even speaking about this

00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:34,629
example but if you ask somebody to go

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,809
away then you've specifically attacked

00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,399
them as an individual so and sometimes

00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:43,449
to the choices for alternative

00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:45,939
alternative maintainer z-- or your

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,219
alternatives are perhaps untested or

00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:50,019
maybe intractable as well and then

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:53,139
you've got the added issue that it's a

00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:55,509
social problem in a entirely volunteer

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,539
organization where you can't pay someone

00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,550
money to do a job or fire them you're

00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,679
you're operating at their sufferance and

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,599
their volunteer time so I mean I think

00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:09,509
that's some of the reluctance but let's

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:11,349
see what else yeah I mean one problem

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,269
well I mean we've got a number of

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,649
problems on this particular question one

00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:17,489
is it it's just a very difficult thing

00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:21,519
to do for the reasons that Don has

00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:23,639
mentioned but the Technical Committee

00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,579
has had difficulty with this in the past

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:31,769
we have historically been extremely

00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:34,959
reluctant to overall maintain as a tool

00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,880
this is something that I'm not so happy

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,279
with but my colleagues seem to feel

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,050
differently about this to me so well you

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,120
know I get to be out voted to but there

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,220
are other reasons people don't tend to

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,860
bring issues to us until they've got

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,820
really frustrated with them and by the

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,180
time you've got really frustrated

00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,560
the bad blood and the flame wars are

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,650
just really impossible and often you end

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,260
up with a situation where nobody yeah

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,450
nobody who fancies having a good time

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,270
and doesn't want to get involved in a

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,800
huge argument will really step up and

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,460
say well I'd like to help out with this

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,160
package that seems to have some problem

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,510
and also we've had there's the

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,220
constitutional rule that we're not

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:28,560
allowed to have private conversations

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:30,780
and in practice what happens most

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,270
recently is people have been emailing us

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,740
privately to ask our opinion by you know

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,860
picking out the email addresses of the

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,520
members and just putting them in a to

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,490
field this is a bit irregular it's

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,140
worked a lot better than you might

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,270
expect because we can kind of you people

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,400
can ask us a question without having to

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,020
kind of publicly come out and make a big

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,240
deal of in and then we can say well

00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,950
actually maybe this would be a more

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,840
constructive way forward or whatever and

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,180
it doesn't necessarily have to become a

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,480
huge Rao this is something I'd like to

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,000
see us do more of I'm not sure my

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,160
colleagues want to be quite as

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,220
interventionist as I do I think it would

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,790
be useful for us to try out a mediation

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,920
role one of the reasons for that is that

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:24,120
we would be able to directly experience

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,830
how a maintainer who was being

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,580
criticized actually dealt with

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,920
interactions with us and then this will

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,440
give us some information about you know

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,240
did we think that the complainant was

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,150
more right than the maintainer or what

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,560
have you

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:46,050
also it depends of course on who we

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,410
might have as alternatives I think

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,110
that's all I had to say that so I don't

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,120
know that in my own case I've ever felt

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,700
particularly reluctant to overrule

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,160
people or even to sort of make choices

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,730
the problem is that the the right

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,040
answers are often just not very clear

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,650
and so one of the things that that I

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,840
think's gonna be very interesting about

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,290
some what Ian's trying to propose about

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,640
sort of the possibility of a

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,070
constitutional amendment to enable

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,330
explicit sort of private conversations

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,000
between developers and the tech

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,340
committee is that it creates the sort of

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,140
intermediate third state between a

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,970
public discussion that's archived

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,670
because it's on the committee's mailing

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,470
list or associated with bug reports that

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,720
have been assigned to the committee and

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,760
what has always happened and will

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,220
continue to happen if people choosing to

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,140
reach out individually and privately to

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,430
members of the committee or find you at

00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,440
dinner at deb conf and have a

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,720
conversation you know ask your opinion

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,220
on something or whatever and put us in

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,810
this interesting sort of situation of

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,730
having this in between state where

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,620
you're publicly acknowledging that

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,930
you're having a private conversation

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,360
and i haven't really quite completely

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,950
wrapped my brain yet around how that's

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,590
actually gonna make a practical

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,450
difference in the way we as humans

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,230
choose to interact with each other but

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,180
it at least provides some constitutional

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,130
air cover if you will for the notion

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,110
that it's okay for us to be you know

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,510
trying to resolve conflict without

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,730
necessarily doing it all in public with

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,140
everybody's dirty laundry visible all

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,140
the time for all the reasons

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,620
so going back to Neal's specific

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:34,290
question I think you did ask about the

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,670
particular issue of making decisions

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,070
about who should be the maintainer of a

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,600
package if actually if I look back at

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,980
the the history of the Technical

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,889
Committee I can think of very few

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,339
occasions where that particular question

00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:50,660
has been put to us and so to a certain

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:53,459
degree I think we are perhaps

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,399
inexperienced at actually resolving such

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,899
questions because this is not the sort

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,250
of question that generally gets referred

00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,649
to the techno committee partly because

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,130
people who are actually having a dispute

00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:07,920
over who should maintain a package to

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:13,860
the point where they would try to get

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:16,170
something like you know changed are they

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,480
generally are have fire in their bellies

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,339
about it and are looking for a quick

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,589
resolution and the Technica Mitte does

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:26,880
is does not generally provide quick

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:30,449
solutions and so there many people will

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,160
in fact those who is one of several

00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:34,880
sub-optimal socially suboptimal

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,430
solutions which may be that they will

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,630
decide to just give up and go away even

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,000
though they think there's a problem or

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,740
they will try to browbeat the other

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
person into giving up so they can take

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,829
over the package or they will you know

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,980
this sort of thing and I do see

00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:54,029
scenarios where there are disputes among

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,980
members of the community over who should

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,899
maintain a package which do get resolved

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,360
by this sort of thing they have very

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:03,320
rarely actually been referred to the

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,970
Technical Committee I think it would be

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,410
well I'm not sure if I think it would

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,339
actually be healthier to have more of

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,810
those refer to the Technical Committee

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,910
because they are twisty issues they

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,040
always are and I don't know if if the

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,300
technical committee actually can do a

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:21,630
better job you know keeping our keeping

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,029
keeping people civil about it then then

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,209
the status quo as far as our problem

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,430
solving processes there but I do think

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,199
that you know this is this has been an

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,220
exceptional case and I think we finally

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,019
actually reached some sort of a

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,470
consensus which just now has to get

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,740
written up and

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:42,660
but it's been a long time coming and you

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,120
know II on your point about private

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,370
conversations as well I think is is I

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
think that's also been a key one for us

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,509
because especially when you're talking

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,310
about who who should maintain a package

00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:58,440
that winds up often being as much about

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,540
non-technical social communication

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,959
interpersonal issues whatever it might

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,160
be as it does about actual technical

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,470
things you can point at saying that the

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,500
package has been badly maintained and

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:18,839
that makes it you know that much harder

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:21,240
to actually sort out and untangle I more

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,399
a comment than a question what you're

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,810
saying about changing the Constitution

00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,259
to acknowledge something that's already

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:32,459
happening might not per se solve

00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,860
anything except for aligning with what

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:38,009
is already going on which is always

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:41,190
important because if you let the the the

00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:44,730
formal rules diverge too much from

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:51,000
custom you know practice then they

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:53,910
become irrelevant that's that's a very

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,029
good point there's also the fact that at

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,230
the moment you know when these kind of

00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,329
conversations take place there's a

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,069
certain amount of guilt going on and

00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:03,839
there's you know it's not an advertised

00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:05,310
thing we don't have an email address

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,949
like a role address that you can email

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:10,560
to say you know I'm having a bit of

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:16,380
difficulty here can you help et cetera

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:20,699
and so I think we're failing we have an

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:23,430
opportunity to help people resolve their

00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:26,850
disputes before they get to a really bad

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,980
stage which at the moment we're missing

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:31,170
because there's really nobody in the

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,139
project that you can go to who will help

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,880
you out with that who also then will

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,069
have the ability to make a decision

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,199
stick at the end of it and the technical

00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,939
meaty does in principle have the ability

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,620
to make its decision stick at the end if

00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:44,880
you you know if you ask the Technical

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,589
Committee for help and the technical

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,610
meaty actually agrees with you in

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,450
principle

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:54,310
they have the power to sort it out but

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,720
at the moment you can't really go to the

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,579
technique the only way you can do it is

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,790
by filing one of these you know huge

00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:03,339
character assassination bugs and that's

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:06,459
not yeah that that does not lead to good

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:11,020
outcomes and I would like us to formally

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:13,809
say we would like to try to resolve

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,000
these things in a way that that fits

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,910
better with the way that social monkeys

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,679
work and that's not to say that we won't

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,360
you know when it comes down to who will

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,890
make all the decisions in public and if

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,110
we're having technical discussions about

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,790
some bug or other that that won't happen

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,980
in public as well that that kind of

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,169
stuff absolutely fine but when we're

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,880
saying you know I'm having some

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,610
difficulty talking to this maintainer

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,040
can you please try and help me persuade

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,280
them or you know we don't seem to be

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,720
getting on that's the kind of thing that

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,070
you really can't do in public you have

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,720
to do it in private because then it's

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,970
not a criticism it's just like will you

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,669
give me a helping hand and hopefully

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:56,820
we'll be able to maybe resolve some of

00:17:51,669 --> 00:18:00,970
these clashes before they get to

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,440
unpleasantness and and I completely

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,540
agree with all that and I think it's all

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,160
good and I think the point in particular

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,809
of the notion that you might have some

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,840
well-defined place to go for some

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:12,490
mediation help that actually has some

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,790
authority behind it in the end if needed

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:21,549
is really great the flip side of that to

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:23,049
me is that everybody who knows me at all

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:25,210
knows that I've been around this project

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:28,150
a long time I've had the privilege of

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,460
being asked questions by everyone who's

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,370
ever been the Debian project leader all

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,350
the way back to in Murdoch I've had the

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,870
you know the privilege or the

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,150
frustration or the the angst or whatever

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,610
of being approached by people a lot of

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,470
times over the years who wanted help

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,179
understanding why somebody was attacking

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:50,950
them or you know hated what they did or

00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,870
you know there's this sort of there's

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,460
this role you know you're mentioning the

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,100
council of elders thing in a different

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,410
context yesterday I certainly am aware

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,410
of the fact that there's this important

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,630
role that people have been around

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,670
for a while and have some sense of

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,650
context for sort of what's important and

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,990
what's not in this project in order for

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,050
it to be successful in the long term

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,360
that there's a role to be played which I

00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,760
don't mind having the part of what I do

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,320
which is to just try to be helpful and

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,620
in particular to try to help people

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,670
understand how to get things done when

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,860
they're frustrated and to me I hope that

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,490
nobody ever sort of feels that they

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,770
absolutely have to have you know some

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:37,080
sort of good housekeeping stamp of

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,300
approval on them as having some special

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,680
role in order to be willing to turn to

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,610
the person next to them and answer a

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,920
question or to invite somebody to say

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:50,460
hey you know if you're not happy and and

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:53,250
and working for demyans not making your

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,200
life better then let me help you figure

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,330
out why and help you fix it because

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,650
that's the thing that people who care

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,380
about each other and are working

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:04,350
together collaboratively in the kind of

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,240
community that we are can and should and

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,890
ought to do for each other and I see it

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,660
happen all the time I see lots of people

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,730
sort of going off to have a conversation

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,150
and coming back feeling better about the

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,860
world and I hope that we all sort of

00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,270
take some personal ownership and

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,340
responsibility for making sure that

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,710
happens independently of whether we

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,350
successfully go through the process of

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,320
making it more obvious that you can come

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,920
to the tech committee for mediation help

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,560
independently of you know asking for

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,710
some specific decision on a specific bug

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,590
that gets reassigned to us and so I hope

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,290
that all makes sense but it's it's not

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,210
that I'm negative about the formalism or

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,040
that I'm reticent to make decisions or

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,240
anything like that I just put a huge

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,470
emphasis on the value of the informal

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,690
kinds of interactions that we can have

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,210
as a way of trying to deal with most of

00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,470
the things that otherwise end up you

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,770
know requiring some kind of a

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:09,420
frustratingly complex unhappy for

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:11,250
somebody formal vote so Russ and burries

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,800
comment on our C's and he agrees with

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,480
Ian that we don't manage to head off

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,400
these questions soon enough

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,470
but he's worried about whether we have

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,020
the resources to manage to do a lot of

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,090
mediation and that leads to a question

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,040
from possibly a question from Ben

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:32,700
Hutchins which is that are there any

00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:34,560
plans to appoint new members right so

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,560
the question of resources I think is one

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,970
that we will have to we'll have to cross

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,040
that bridge I think that the right way

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,870
to deal with that would be to try to bid

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,390
and see if it works well and if we get

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,520
all horribly overloaded then you know

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,070
we'll have to do something else in terms

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,140
of adding new members well we are at our

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,810
maximum size of eight you can't see that

00:21:52,140 --> 00:22:01,320
on the slide anymore but there are

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:03,210
there's a you know there are perhaps at

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,250
least one person on the committee who

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,310
hasn't been seen in some time

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,050
we might persuade them to step aside or

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,510
if they don't answer their email we

00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:17,340
might just say well actually we better

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:20,430
to have somebody else it's not that

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,220
clear that you know of those eight

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:28,830
people seven of them are reasonably

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:33,890
active I would say and one more or less

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:37,050
inactive member is is a survival level

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,660
if people think that the TC should be

00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,780
bigger then that's certainly something

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:46,230
that could be considered we're in the

00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:50,400
process of writing up a set of

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:52,620
constitutional amendment GRS to sort out

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,580
the supermajority thing to permit us to

00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:01,980
have private conversations and fix a

00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:05,160
couple of little bugs yeah re numbering

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:14,250
section 8.1 to not be the same as number

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:16,200
one but it would be certainly be

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,540
possible for us to increase the maximum

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,930
size in the Constitution it's not clear

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:25,070
to everybody whether that's better

00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,930
it might become a more awkward

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,159
cumbersome kind of organization where

00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,049
you need to persuade more

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,359
people and you need to have longer

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,479
conversations and frankly things are

00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,269
already taking quite a long time often

00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:40,619
and not just because we're all busy

00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:42,840
people and don't always get around to

00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,149
things but also just because when you've

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,909
got seven or eight people all who who

00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:50,999
might have an opinion that takes quite a

00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:52,799
while to build a consensus or to

00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:54,749
discover that there isn't a consensus I

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,509
mean sometimes it's really easy when

00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:58,619
enough of us get together in one place

00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:00,599
which sometimes happens at dev

00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:02,549
conference sometimes doesn't or might

00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,349
happen in our IRC meetings we've

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,639
discovered on some of these things that

00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:08,580
if enough of us are in the right place

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:11,690
we can all kind of go yep and then we

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,099
move on and you know write a write a

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,409
something of a resolution to vote on and

00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,330
just move on and so I think the thing

00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,349
that's likely to actually help the most

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:24,989
in this regard is having some kind of a

00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:26,609
regular excuse to Steve says you know

00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:28,259
make sure the action items have actually

00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:30,509
had you know at least five minutes put

00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:32,639
to him since the last month and and get

00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,700
together and in trying to actually work

00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:37,710
through some of these things and in fact

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,979
as I mentioned of the three open issues

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,840
right now Steve did put forward a call

00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,700
for votes on one of the ones that he

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,099
took as an action item at one of our

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,830
meetings and that one hopefully will be

00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:52,859
resolved here in the next week or so and

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,720
of the other two one the third one which

00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,519
has to do with the supermajority thing

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,559
there's quite a bit of discussion going

00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,200
on the last day or so on our list about

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,690
exactly what the wording of the amended

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,429
Constitution ought to be so that we

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,590
don't sort of create yet another funny

00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:10,499
potential fence posting situation in the

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,999
future and that's all great we'll talk

00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:13,470
through that and our heads we'll all

00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:15,029
explode and once we've got all the

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,269
pieces pulled back together we'll figure

00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:20,190
out exactly what text we want and we'll

00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:23,450
put that out and you'll probably all get

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,440
to vote on a gr here at some point so

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,210
those are all sort of making progress

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,769
and I actually you know other than the

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,440
fact that it embarrassed me when I

00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:33,570
realized that the the Python maintainer

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,570
ship bug I really didn't have to edit it

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,999
from my slide from last year other than

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,590
the embarrassment over that it feels to

00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:43,259
me like things are actually going okay

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,749
and we could actually handle more

00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:48,600
enquiries more requests for decisions if

00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:50,220
there are some I'm completely happy to

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,690
live in a world where the Technical

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,190
Committee is boring because we don't

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,159
have much to do because Debian

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:58,110
developers are taking responsibility for

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,690
the work they do and are collaborating

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,340
and arguing and working through their

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,840
differences with people sitting next to

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,559
them and don't need us that would just

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,620
be brilliant right I I agree with what

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:13,139
Beatle is just said but I don't think

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,090
actually that the world is that good at

00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:17,970
place we're all pretty nice people as by

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,519
and large but any organization as big as

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:24,059
Debian with as many bugs as Debian house

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,830
is going to have some you know there are

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:28,740
going to be situations where somebody

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,529
gets it wrong and it's important enough

00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,230
that that needs to be looked at again by

00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:36,570
somebody and at the moment I don't get

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,309
the feeling that when particularly as

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:42,419
the submitter of a bug you're in this

00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:45,149
position the people consider escalating

00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:49,590
the back to the TC for a technical

00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:50,970
decision and I guess that's probably

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,539
because people don't think we'll make a

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,820
decision within any reasonable timeframe

00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:59,700
and historically that's been true but I

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:07,649
think recently we've shown that we can

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:10,440
do a lot better than that I have another

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:12,869
type of question I mean you said okay we

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,169
have the eight places just basically

00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:17,879
taken but also most of the issues or

00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:20,340
some of the issues have nowadays been

00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:22,320
human instead of technical do you think

00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,210
that the current set of people that are

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,970
actually in the seats of the technical

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,070
committee are represented of wide enough

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,629
diversity in the project I mean just to

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,240
take an easy example there is not a

00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:34,529
single woman focus um so do we think do

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,629
you think there is something to be

00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:39,149
changed in that sense I mean nowadays we

00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:43,100
also have non uploading need ease so I

00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:43,100
don't know just a question

00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:50,339
so given some of the responsibilities of

00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:54,339
the Technical Committee which are to

00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:57,039
sort of be a body of expert generalists

00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,709
who can arbitrate on technical issues I

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,999
think I would find it difficult to say

00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:05,529
we should have non uploading Dedes in in

00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:07,959
the sense that many of the people who

00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:09,899
are going through that route are in fact

00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:12,879
not they're doing so because they're not

00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:14,769
technically oriented and they don't

00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:16,269
aren't involved in the same kinds of

00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:18,070
technical they don't have the same

00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:19,779
technical background that the people on

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,329
the technical committee do currently so

00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:23,559
I think I would shy away from saying we

00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:25,690
should make that make it more

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,459
representative in in that regard

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,829
also I'm it's interesting that you bring

00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:33,190
up the question of of having a woman on

00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:34,359
the technical committee because the

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,950
technical committee is actually a

00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,299
currently fairly representative of

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,099
debian as a whole and the fact that we

00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:42,940
don't have any women on it and there are

00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:44,169
very few women in Debian but diversity

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
though is an interesting it's an

00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:49,989
interesting thought I hadn't considered

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:52,299
that myself before now yeah I think it's

00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:54,519
it's important to remember that anybody

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:57,879
can make arguments before the committee

00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:00,269
as well and so while it's true that as

00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:03,159
the body were not particularly diverse

00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:05,919
the diverse opinions are definitely

00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,219
warranted and accepted and hopefully

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:17,409
heated on on the discussions that happen

00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:20,829
so that was also in the sense that most

00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:22,629
of them if I know two people correctly

00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:28,899
or at least the four of here are all

00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:34,389
English native speakers which is just a

00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:35,859
fact right that's so the question I mean

00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:40,659
that that gets on to the wider question

00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:44,679
of you know English being the the

00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:50,379
language of most of the discourse within

00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:53,589
Debian and it's very difficult to run an

00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:57,639
institutional like debian without having

00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:59,020
a lot of common language and that tends

00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:02,200
to lead to a single common

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,580
language and I think given the role of

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,370
the Technical Committee which often

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:10,230
involves a very detailed discussion of

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,230
very technical issues at length

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,700
ultimately I don't think we're going to

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,430
get away from people who have a good

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,600
command of communication in English that

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,610
doesn't mean that they have to be a

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,880
native English speaker and I don't think

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:34,450
that everybody there to them isn't

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:36,130
oh right okay okay well my first

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,830
language was Dutch but it's rusty now I

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,660
can't hardly speak it so don't think

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:50,590
that counts

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:51,730
and of course andreas no no the question

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,900
was can you even function without

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,640
speaking English on the committee and

00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:03,160
the answer is no right but I do think

00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:05,140
there's there's a valid point that Madhu

00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,480
have many fluent English speakers in the

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,740
community in the community of developers

00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,340
who don't have English as their first

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,760
language

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:16,480
and do we in some sense are we failing

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,120
to take on board not by design but by

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,100
accident different cultural perspectives

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,740
that would be more representative of

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,440
significant segments of our developer

00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:31,000
ship by having the composition that we

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,890
do I think it's a really great question

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,200
and it's exactly the kind of thing that

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,730
that you know I worry about particularly

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,530
when we're having conversations around

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,530
the pool at night with a beer in hand or

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:44,020
something but what I can tell you quite

00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:45,970
genuinely and honestly having been a

00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,890
member of the Technical Committee now

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,280
for a number of years and having watched

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,020
it very closely before that you know all

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,420
the way back to certainly at least when

00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,430
I was DPL and probably even before that

00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,700
though that gets long I forgot my

00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:03,100
neurons aren't all that good I can't

00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,550
think of any time in the history of the

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,560
committee where anyone proposed for

00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,290
invited to and brought onto the

00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,590
committee didn't seem like exactly the

00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,650
right choice from

00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:18,800
the body of available developers to help

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,630
with the kinds of decisions that we

00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,970
anticipated the Technical Committee

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,410
would be faced with at that time in

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,110
other words I can't think of any time

00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,820
where there was ever any sort of

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,280
intentional biasing of the process and

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,840
of course all of us who you know read

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,640
and study and care about diversity

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,560
issues understand that you know that's

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,360
exactly the problem sometimes that if

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,000
you don't consciously try to work on

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,610
these things nothing ever changes but at

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,700
the same time given what the original

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:49,610
objectives for having a technical

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:53,330
committee within the Constitution were I

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,280
think the the mix of sort of experiences

00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,770
skill sets and representation of

00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,350
different sort of technical working

00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,910
groups within the project over time if

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,440
you look at this list we've got people

00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,760
who've been release managers we've got

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,260
people who've worked on the Installer

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,030
we've got people who worked on tool

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,980
chains and have worked on you know

00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:13,310
fundamental core infrastructure for the

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,710
project and who you know we worked on

00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,510
the BTS and worked on I mean sort of

00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,450
everything that's kind of fundamentally

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,310
important to the project in terms of

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,710
sort of infrastructure and different

00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:27,880
technical areas graphics various things

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,570
we've got a reasonably broad swath of

00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,760
representation of all the sort of

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:35,510
different technical activities in the

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,170
project even if it's not gender balanced

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:42,350
or racially or culturally or language

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,730
balanced and so it's almost things where

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,780
I agree this is something we ought to

00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,960
care about and we ought to think about

00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:51,260
and when we decide we have an opening

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,450
and it's time to make some changes in

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,300
the list I hope that we'll consider that

00:33:53,450 --> 00:34:00,950
but I don't actually worry about that a

00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:05,240
whole lot another comment from Russ is

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:07,730
that if the the issue of diversity will

00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,500
may become a lot more important a lot

00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,130
more pertinent if the technical Met

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,929
committee starts having to deal with a

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:19,220
lot more social issues now there was a

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,919
proposal a while back to create a social

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,310
committee which hasn't been progressed

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:28,179
do you think that the

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:31,300
and comity should fulfill that role and

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:34,870
if not do you think that there should be

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:37,960
a so well should there be a body to help

00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,310
mediate the the sort of issues as things

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,550
like sometimes the package maintainer

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,750
ship can straddle those lines so in

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,510
answer to the first half of that

00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,159
question by default the factor or

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,620
whatever we are the body that's sort of

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,060
left you can talk to the DPL and trying

00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,919
to get advice you can talk to other

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,470
developers and try and get advice if

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,960
you're looking for someplace to sort of

00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,670
make an authoritative decision right now

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,500
the tech committee is that so whether we

00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,100
really want that or not it's a role that

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,930
you know we're sort of stuck with in

00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,570
terms of whether there should be a

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,190
Social Committee or not that's a really

00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,900
interesting question we had lots of

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,660
discussion as you mentioned a while back

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,430
and unfortunately even to me at that

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,500
time after thinking about it a lot the

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,710
answer wasn't really clear and the

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,690
reason it wasn't really clear is that we

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,930
think we can do a pretty good job of

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,500
defining what is or is not a technical

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:34,570
question but sort of how you bound what

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,410
the responsibilities are and how you

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:44,400
imbue such a group with meaningful power

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:47,530
was never really clear to me yeah I mean

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,890
the channel committee is not the best

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:55,060
constituted body for doing for dealing

00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:57,880
with those problems but it is the only

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:01,870
body that we have in the project that

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,080
has the authority to do that and so by

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:07,120
default we're probably we're at the

00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,070
moment trying to use it for that and and

00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:13,540
we're not using it in a very good way

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:16,750
and maybe we could do better I would

00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,640
like to see us try doing this in a

00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:22,620
slightly more structured way and if it

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,750
goes well then good project does need

00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,220
more attention to this problem and there

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,630
are sort of social problems going on

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,400
that other moment just sort of rumbled

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:35,500
on until eventually somebody gives up if

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,050
it doesn't work we do a bad job we trust

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,490
that everybody will tell us

00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:42,570
then you know we'll do something else

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:47,960
exactly what that something else will be

00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:47,960
we'd have to decide then we the project

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,380
so I believe we were down to less than

00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,910
ten minutes of time so I'd actually like

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,520
to pose a question of the audience here

00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:00,300
at the moment which is we've talked a

00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,580
lot about what the you know what kinds

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,230
of things that we think we have or

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,330
haven't done a good job about and and

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,530
ways that we think we can improve that I

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,970
would kind of like to pose the question

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:13,770
to the the audience to think about

00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:17,850
occasions where there have been issues

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:20,910
that would have been within scope for

00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:22,980
the technical community to consider that

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,290
you did you for whatever reason you did

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,520
not raise to the technical committee and

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,040
that you were not satisfied with how

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,810
those went whether you were you know the

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,930
winner or the loser on the on the

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,730
technical discussion that you did you

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,350
you were either left feeling either the

00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,100
the right technical solution was not

00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:45,720
reached or that you felt bad about the

00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:47,070
process and I'd like to ask are there

00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,440
some of those issues that you think the

00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,870
technical committee should have been

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,750
able to take for you

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,100
and what are we missing for you to have

00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,930
confidence in submitting those things to

00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,930
us can I

00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:22,170
well I noticed Joey didn't come to this

00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:24,390
session well for me personally it was

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,910
the fact that you can't keep anonymous

00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,799
you will ruin some of your reputation if

00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,950
you reach out to the Technical Committee

00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:35,640
publicly and the other thing was that I

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,260
personally was scared that both livering

00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,769
the Technical Committee because your

00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,480
time is valuable and I wouldn't think if

00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:49,799
the issue is important for me would it

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:52,250
be important for you so those are the

00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:52,250
two things

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,920
joy says he's sick I'm sorry Joey feel

00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,920
better

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,800
so about an issue where the Technical

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:21,460
Committee might have been helpful it's

00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:25,900
not my own problem but there has

00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:28,810
recently been an argument between non

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,760
diva non developer so who can't upload a

00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:34,720
new sound and need sponsored uploads and

00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,150
so on and project member it it's

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,340
actually raw audio I think where

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:44,710
basically there's been so the support

00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:48,700
for our audio was removed I didn't

00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:50,980
follow the reasons exactly but basically

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,460
it created a conflict because there are

00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,859
audio maintainer wanted to continue

00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:01,240
providing support for it in other audio

00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:03,550
applications but apparently a developer

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,690
was against it because there were also

00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:11,290
technical issues involved but basically

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,510
the last male from the maintainer I have

00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:17,980
seen was that he basically wants to give

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:19,720
up maintaining the package okay so what

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,550
do you think should have been better

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,609
there do you think that there should be

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,440
a process by which a non DD maintainer

00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:30,339
can escalate issues to the technical

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,810
committee or do you feel that somebody

00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:33,160
involved you said this isn't it not an

00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,230
issue that you personally were involved

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,180
in did you consider raising it to the

00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:40,990
technical committee yourself on behalf

00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:46,570
of the the non non DD uploader

00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:48,760
maintainer or how can we help there well

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,820
it's it's a question who should handle

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:55,030
it so right now basically there's only

00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,220
the technical committee and he was also

00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,640
referred to the technical committee from

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,770
the release team which is I think

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,060
they're a team but it was only other

00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:09,040
release team mailing list so so the

00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,300
release team said take it to the

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,710
technical committee but nobody actually

00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,630
did is that

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:17,710
yeah it was they said basically that

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:21,700
it's not the it does not concern the

00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:24,430
release team but only they should eyes

00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,940
us solve it between themselves or a such

00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:30,400
as the Technical Committee but so I

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,150
actually read some of this flame war and

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,559
I will try to keep my opinion out of it

00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,260
the message I think you're referring to

00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:40,030
was the release team saying we don't

00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,940
want to intervene in this we don't think

00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,829
it's our role and I can't remember

00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,410
exactly what the wording was but

00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:50,050
basically the the intent was if you want

00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,960
to take this further then you should go

00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:55,510
to the Technical Committee and the the

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,440
the developer well the maintainer the

00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:02,710
non DD maintainer who was upset chose

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,680
not to do that inspect but I think it's

00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:08,740
also hard for a non-member to raise such

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,730
things so well harder than for me I

00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:16,349
think it is true that the non Dedes and

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:19,540
maybe nandi maybe even DMS feel that

00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:21,579
they aren't entitled to bring an issue

00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,559
to the Technical Committee but that is

00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:26,859
certainly not the case and there is no

00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,960
restriction that I can see that prevents

00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:31,390
anybody at all even just a random user

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,710
from bringing an issue to the Technical

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:37,270
Committee and so you know you should

00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,069
just not feel inhibited about that and

00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,599
if your if your complaint has no merit

00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:43,329
then we will dismiss it on his merits

00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,859
not because of your stand

00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:47,410
I also say there are points in history

00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:51,430
when we had you know a flurry of bugs

00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:54,849
handed to us by one person in particular

00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:57,760
that we chose to treat as not being of

00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:59,079
merit and to explain to them that you

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,270
know that wasn't the right thing to do

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,150
and and to sort of close them without

00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,619
further action taken but the point that

00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,869
I'm trying to make is we're not afraid

00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:10,510
to do that so I would encourage as ian

00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:13,890
has just has that anybody I don't care

00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:17,430
if it's a user of a package a DM a DD a

00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:19,599
sponsored uploading maintainer person

00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,790
you know please if there's something we

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,230
can help with that falls within the

00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,120
purview of the tech committee then you

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,640
know please do it and

00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,530
we will let you know if we think we've

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,840
got value to add and if we don't we'll

00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,210
try to make that clear in a reasonable

00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,620
time frame which is he in loves to

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,150
continue pointing out is something that

00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:52,030
wasn't always the case but I certainly

00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:54,250
hope from here forward will be the other

00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:56,080
comment that is waiting to make is how

00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,510
do you give teas to a social committee

00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,730
you don't necessarily give this to it

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,550
for instance you might make private

00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:07,390
resolution the default and publication

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:09,460
of the issue only if the committee or a

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:14,110
mediator can't get the parties to agree

00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:16,150
oh sorry so you know you don't

00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:20,080
necessarily give a social conflict

00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:23,650
resolution team committee mediators

00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,600
teeth private resolution is the best

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,090
outcome getting the parties to agree is

00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,730
the best outcome and maybe if you can't

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:35,200
get them to agree mere publication of

00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:38,890
the issue to say okay well you put an

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,170
issue forth yeah I understand what

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,720
you're trying to say and if we want to

00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,580
have a BA for something and talk again

00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,110
about whether Debian should have a

00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,160
social committee and if so what it

00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:51,280
should do and how it should be

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,380
constituted and so forth it's great in

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,970
the context of the Technical Committee I

00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,280
think that what we're trying to

00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:00,610
accomplish with the change that's being

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,820
proposed to head towards a gr at some

00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:07,390
point is this notion that it ought to be

00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,880
explicitly constitutionally okay for the

00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:13,210
technical committee to have private

00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,740
discussions amongst itself or with you

00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,740
know other members of the project if

00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:21,310
that seems like the most effective way

00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:24,670
to address a particular concern and then

00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:26,260
you know the the language discussions

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,930
that we've been having about the

00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:31,540
proposed text the last day or two are

00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:34,360
really all around this notion of how do

00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,670
we make sure that while enabling that we

00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,359
don't sort of enable the committee to

00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,069
somehow star

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,920
doing everything it wants to do in

00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:43,930
secret which would not be desirable and

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,730
how do we ensure that everyone

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,799
understands both the committee members

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,200
and the rest of the project in the rest

00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:53,349
of the world that our bias is always in

00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,539
favor of doing as much openly publicly

00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,089
you know in view as possible because

00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:59,710
that's part of our you know projects

00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:03,690
fundamental core value about

00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,690
transparency and not hiding problems I

00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:08,619
suggested last word from the Technical

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,069
Committee because we are running out of

00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:13,799
time

00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:13,799
the video team has to take some rest so

00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:20,259
so I had a thought along the way here

00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:22,509
and I'm gonna spit it out and share it

00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:23,950
with all of you that the fact that we're

00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:26,140
now doing IRC meetings I think is

00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,130
actually a very important change for the

00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,119
Technical Committee and the fact that

00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,999
we're dealing with these things in real

00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,230
time for the simple reason that

00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:34,239
contentious issues discussed on mailing

00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,640
lists have a very hard time converging

00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,440
even when everybody involved is actually

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,989
reasonable and of generally the same

00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,269
mindset and could in fact hash these

00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:45,160
things out if left to their own devices

00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:47,829
and you know in in real time in a room

00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:51,940
or whatever and so I think there's

00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:53,829
there's a lesson to be taken from the

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,349
seeing how the Technical Committee has

00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:58,359
let issues linger in the past versus

00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:59,950
what we're doing now with IRC I think

00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:02,349
there's a lesson there for the wider

00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,509
Debian community about finding ways to

00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:06,400
resolve issues that don't rely on trying

00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:10,269
to get a mailing list thread to reach a

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,259
conclusion I mean from this thing one of

00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:13,089
the things that people been talking

00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:14,619
about is setting up VoIP or something

00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:16,749
for all of Debian and something like

00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,730
that would be amazing so if anybody

00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:20,529
continues thinking about that that would

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,690
be pretty awesome I can imagine having

00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:25,410
an IRC conference room with a couple

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,910
thousand developers I'd be pretty cool I

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,980
think the final word for me is I'd

00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:32,019
really like to see a couple of nice

00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,980
technical issues come to the technical

00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:34,720
committee where there's just a

00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,759
disagreement about how some package

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,039
should behave and that would be you know

00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:40,690
exactly yes or no on a given patch that

00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,259
would be that would be great and I think

00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:46,299
we can based on the performance part

00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:47,829
over the past two IRC meetings I think

00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:50,570
you can probably expect to actually get

00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:53,210
an answer so please go ahead

00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:55,820
and I'll wrap up just by thanking all of

00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,740
you for your time and attention today we

00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:00,110
certainly want to do everything we can

00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,870
to help make the project be successful

00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,580
within the sort of context and

00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:07,400
constraints established for us by the

00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:09,800
Constitution we very much appreciate

00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,630
your interest and please feel free to

00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,610
follow discussions on our mailing list

00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,110
and chime in when you've got useful

00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:21,780
opinions to add thanks very much

00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:21,780
