	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
start so welcome to travel sponsorship

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:12,330
sponsoring buff and I can just let Scout

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,040
ins to the next for the light covers it

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,789
would also for you be nice if you could

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:25,680
sit here so we can talk together and not

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:27,570
hide behind the others its I was

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,130
originally the one proposing this buff

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:35,600
then the Tiago got mo Giacomo and David

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,370
joined me and the list is ordered by the

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,410
alphabetic order of the first names

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,289
if you wonder and we tried to prepare

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,360
this buff two days ago

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,969
I think it was and we had already had a

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,370
discussion of two hours so tight we'll

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,980
be a bit constrained so if then you

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,320
decided or I'm gonna be a bit to manage

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,989
David is going to take some notes on

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,270
Bobby you can all if you want connect to

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,049
the go be dots Debian dot org server

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:12,780
there's on the Buffs it has a document

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:15,299
travel sponsorship and I'm going to do a

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,450
short introduction but then I think it

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,229
should be open discussion we defined

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:27,350
some topics we would like to discuss and

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:30,150
yeah so the goals for this session we

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,119
thought that we have to narrow this a

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,509
bit down because it's that not that's a

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,090
broad topic and our goals are to have

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,579
better defined criteria for the next

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,829
step conf so we can try out this process

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:50,850
and for next step conf and possibly

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:54,119
better or other or different questions

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,360
matching these criteria and the third

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,820
goal is it's nice to talk here we had

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,390
these talks twice I think in the past

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:08,810
and something's changed to also but

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,810
something's going on

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:23,300
lalalala lalalala okay so at the end of

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:29,120
this session we would also like to form

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:31,340
a team that carries on with this we have

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,610
some non goals this session should not

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,709
be about the actual money handling not

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,060
about what was discussed on the mailing

00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:43,480
list already there it's not said what

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,340
was discussed there but I think that's

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,870
somewhat a different topic so we would

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,690
like to keep this out of this session

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,209
and also accommodation and food

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,079
sponsoring if possible should be kept

00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:00,049
out so how it works today for those that

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:05,420
don't know or have never been involved

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:07,640
with it it's this year's process in it

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,540
works similar in previous year but not

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,700
exactly the same the applicants they

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,329
have to fill in the form in Penta they

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,819
give us the total travel cost

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:29,209
the next question is labeled amount I'm

00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:31,579
unable to found myself not yet that's

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,639
the wording behalf now in Penton now

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:37,850
it's just about what we have now to see

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:42,739
and there's enough time for discussion

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:45,709
afterwards and there's a free one free

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,870
text rationale that's why but what are

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,680
you doing for Debian why do you request

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:55,609
sponsorship so we have did these three

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,910
things then the team writes all the

00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:02,209
applicants on two dimensions one is the

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:07,130
contributor level the other is called

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:10,130
requested amount for writers and it's on

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:14,120
a scale from - - that these are - - that

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:17,660
will combine it without a - plus plus so

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,939
it analysts there's a zero level in the

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:25,789
middle so it's five on five levels and

00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:30,770
we then combine these two writings into

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:35,449
one and with a white for the contributor

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:41,120
level of 0.6 and for the requested

00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:47,000
amount ranking on of 0.4 then they were

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:50,210
sorted according this score and granted

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,610
sponsoring just going down the list

00:04:50,210 --> 00:05:05,810
until we reach 80 the batch at $80,000

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:13,789
$80,000 of amounts they were unable to

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:18,310
fund of this question some statistics as

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:24,979
I said $80,000 was the budget this year

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:27,650
last year it was 33 thousand euros we

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:31,479
had this year 42 applicants we don't

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:36,680
know for last year and we granted 18

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:41,779
requests of those 18 for one it was too

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:46,430
late so he cancelled and in 2011 53

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:48,500
requests were granted we don't know if

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,279
there were male more applicants than

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,909
these 52 at all or if everyone got it

00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:59,930
and the team thought that we would have

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:04,759
liked to grant 9 additional requests if

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:07,699
there would have been more money and the

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:11,180
rest of the applicants were below zero

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,969
on our score so we thought it we don't

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,930
do not like to grant this request even

00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,930
if we had more money

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:31,539
but this year he also only granted

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,819
sponsorship if you could found the full

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:37,150
amount right there was no sponsorship

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:40,780
there was some discussion among the team

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:45,099
if we should do partial sponsorship of

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:50,229
the requested amount and maturity of the

00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:53,380
team decided to not do that on the basis

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:57,370
that if it reads amount I'm unable to

00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:08,440
found 80% of it is worthless because

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:12,250
then they don't come so the first

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,190
discussion topic is and I think that

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:21,099
will probably be the the one that takes

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:23,590
most of the time also is that what

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:25,770
should be the criteria the basis for

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,550
granting these travel sponsorship

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,630
requests now we have these two

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,630
dimensions it's need and its

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:38,080
contribution level yes yeah I have a

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,550
question from IRC it was the money for

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,530
the one cancellation subsequently

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:48,400
allocated to anyone else no and it was

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:51,190
not because at some time the hole that

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:56,050
comes team decided to not do this

00:07:51,190 --> 00:08:00,009
because it's too late I think the

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:09,330
confirmation of sponsorship was sent

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:09,330
like three weeks before yeah

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,020
because money was available too late

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,849
Thiago Sultan just to give you an

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:23,949
overview was what we planned the next

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:27,990
topic would be about the information we

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:32,020
then need what should we ask a few ideas

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:35,409
then one about should these requests and

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:42,550
what was granted to be made public

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:47,259
and how to proceed just a short summary

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:51,910
of the criteria I think that there as I

00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:54,189
said rightly worrying of opinions and I

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,100
think the varying opinions are mostly

00:08:54,189 --> 00:09:00,519
grouped around this question should it

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,129
be and if yes how based on the actual

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:08,019
need of the person requesting it or not

00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:11,230
it ranges from oh if you should only

00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:15,550
request it if I can't buy food anymore

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,740
if I don't get it - if my employer does

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,769
not pay it then you should just request

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:27,399
it and if possible also get it the money

00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:30,730
and another question we could ask do we

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,910
need agreed-upon criteria at all or

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:37,480
there are also opinions that say and if

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:41,829
the opinion about this are distributed

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:45,750
or varying inside the team then we get

00:09:41,829 --> 00:10:01,149
in the end somewhat the consensus of

00:09:45,750 --> 00:10:02,740
whatever criteria might be applied no

00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,130
just a quick comment on that last point

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,279
since it was originally a concern for me

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:12,790
- but then I realized what we had

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,569
essentially was eight or ten independent

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,380
ratings of each person and as long as

00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,839
each rater

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:26,559
rated all people the same way then it's

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:29,319
in some sense ok I mean to actually

00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,250
answer the question about should these

00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:39,250
requests be public it's generally not

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,509
considered a good idea to publish for

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,800
example the kind of thing that you would

00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,640
have to put on an application like your

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,459
income and so forth

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:53,089
and in a lot of cultures there's stigma

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:55,580
associated to yeah needing financial

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,910
health and in particular giving detailed

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,950
information necessary so at the very

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,720
least I don't think that we could

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,930
sensibly publish the amount of

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,690
sponsorship that people have received

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:11,329
maybe it would be worth just identifying

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,820
who was thought of sufficiently valuable

00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:19,880
contributor that they received some kind

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:22,220
of sponsorship could please stay on

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:31,490
topic now and I think we will try to

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:35,420
have the other topics writers is more

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:38,779
fair for everybody criteria because also

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,730
those people that feel like maybe I'm

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:46,250
cheating the project if I'm asking for

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:51,220
sponsorship I feel guilty so I think

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:54,140
it's it will be fair more fair if it's I

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,850
don't think it's I don't agree that

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,810
we've got people making the judgment but

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,649
there is a problem at the moment of

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,570
people apply unevenly I mean myself I've

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,620
never applied for DEF CON travel

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,060
sponsorship because I think there are

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,450
other people in Debian who need money

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,010
far more for that however if we decide

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,450
that actually it's fine for everyone to

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,329
apply then I don't really object

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,610
fundamentally I try to start applying to

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:19,430
I think it's a bit silly at the moment

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,890
if some people apply and get it just

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,540
because they think it's okay to apply

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,740
and other people are not apply I don't

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,660
think I'm you're so unique and that in

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,430
not apply to the moment because we kind

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:34,640
of assume it's people who really need it

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:36,199
in a more fundamental way speaking as

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,899
the guy who's trying to take minutes I

00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:42,670
also would like it if we followed the

00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:49,940
topic so can we talk about criteria now

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:52,160
is that your plan not that it's an

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,579
important these are everything is

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,260
important that people but I think

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,510
talking about criteria is also talking

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,910
about if we really need criteria and I

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:17,630
think that was your topic

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:19,370
okay sorry before we move on from that

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,320
and forget about it entirely the the

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:26,630
where the no criteria thing comes from

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:31,520
possibly an idea of mine last year which

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:33,590
is that the it's not that you have no

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,480
criteria do you have a smorgasbord of

00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,380
criteria that you suggest to the team

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,590
and they can apply them as they feel fit

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,010
to produce an ordered list and that if

00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,170
you then get people rising to the top of

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,700
those ordered lists they will get funded

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,700
for all the reasons that all the people

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,020
in the team think are important and I

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,720
think the problem with having a fixed

00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,550
criteria is that quite often you have

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
people in the team applying criteria

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,140
they don't really agree with and then

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,910
sort of subtly gaming the way they give

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,100
their points to try and make the

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,020
criteria they really agree with pop out

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,140
of the system at the end and that's much

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,900
worse I think to kind of ideas about

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,970
criteria here one is who we think should

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,650
be applying at all and who we kind of

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,270
advertised should be applying and one is

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,400
how we actually make the judgment I'm

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,990
not but in my point of a moment ago I

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,220
wasn't trying to say how we should

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,290
actually make the judgment in the end

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,270
precisely but I think we should an

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,360
absolute minimum even if we didn't have

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,160
a formulated metric for comparing people

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,900
we should at the minimum have advertised

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,420
who we are expecting to apply are we

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,160
expecting everyone coming to be that to

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,260
validly apply and get money if we happen

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,420
to have it lying around or are is this

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,480
meant to be a bursary scheme for

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:53,960
particularly people who particularly

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:59,930
need it yeah I'm not exactly sure I

00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:03,680
might be off topic because I following

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,950
both Mauryan fields so sorry for that

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,890
please slow down when you speak people

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,640
my suggestion talking about criteria my

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,500
first

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:18,140
he was sharing the way we raters

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,670
actually rated up to now but I don't

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,110
know if that's a good idea test now in

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,180
the session yeah that could be done

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:29,810
briefly preferably but that could give

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,030
ideas to others my personal idea is we

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,120
shouldn't have all the same criteria to

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:40,340
kind of balance them together in some

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,950
way should they it's hard for me to say

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,500
they should be public or not because I'm

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,970
having even hard time sometimes to be

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,530
sure about my own criteria once you have

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,320
done this you understand what I'm

00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,300
talking about I guess so that was a

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,890
proposal I don't know maybe it's too

00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,890
long time for this session I don't know

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:10,520
so my own criteria I was trying to avoid

00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:14,750
to make a kind of put quotes where

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:18,680
needed preference to always the same

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:21,110
people in some way I witnessed that we

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,480
tend to do that with travel some

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,630
sponsorship sponsorship overtime it's

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:31,700
like three successive DEP confine doing

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:33,860
that and I try to imagine the

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,280
contribution of people and more of a

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,290
picture of what they could bring to two

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,250
Debian so it was kind of the same idea

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:47,090
joy has brought loss loss that comes I

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,970
think for Debian newbies or things like

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,910
that and I'm happy that this year we I

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,010
think we have been able to do that in

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,480
some way to bring new people in Debian

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:03,680
and not sponsor codes always the same

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,630
people right I'm sure those people some

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,959
need that some of a very valuable

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,930
contributors I ended up plus plus all

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,650
the time those people I know how wide

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:19,100
and respected and important or whatever

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,940
Debian contributors so these were mostly

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,300
my criteria and my criteria for rating

00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,660
travel was

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,450
or are trying to guess the price and

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,400
whether it's reasonable or not for the

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,730
person to request out of that place

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:41,070
of course somewhere more expensive than

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:43,410
others and try to forget that it's not

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:53,370
really precise but this is the way I did

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:55,410
actually there's more than one criteria

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,070
there's more than one group of people

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,570
who deserve sponsorship they're

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,540
different reasons and different level of

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,310
the amount people cannot pay so I think

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,310
this should be taken into consideration

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,050
and also what Christian said this new

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,030
initiative is also a good thing we

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,560
should keep having like we had a last

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,250
year and the year before and not this

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,290
year which I'm very sad about but there

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,820
was the idea Christian proposed that

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:29,310
every dose that righted this year should

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:32,100
explain a bit how they did it so we're

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,750
drifting away of the topic I know it's

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,260
going a bit back in time but well

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:40,140
Jonathan will chair says that well just

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,180
ring into this he would be very unhappy

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,700
to have specific numbers say a specific

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:49,200
amounts published he wouldn't mind a a

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,160
Jonathan was sponsored partially

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,510
sponsored but not the specific numbers I

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,760
I suspect the number of applications

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,310
would drop - and therefore valuable

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,800
contributors might not get a chance to

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:07,440
be there I mean well we went already

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:12,000
over it but to that topic I think it's

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,400
completely clear that the granted

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,650
sponsorship should be public that's I

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,530
mean we as Debian need to document how

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:23,510
we spend our money so we cannot say oh

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:31,170
yeah we we hid it there under the carpet

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:33,840
there is but try to ensure that we have

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,409
time for this topic but really like to

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:42,809
keep it on topic now Thanks

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:45,510
yeah number with just one other opinion

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:49,769
about how you did the writing no no if

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,500
Bremner yeah I think for contribution

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,549
level I just did a quick google or

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,090
Debian orc

00:19:53,549 --> 00:20:00,990
search and for the requested amount it

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,090
was a bit fuzzy I don't know if I

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,580
consistently myself applied the same

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,159
criteria because I was constantly asking

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:12,059
about it oh I didn't know really how to

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:15,570
wait this but you definitely got a

00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:20,340
higher ranking by me if you paid a

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:22,139
substantial amount yourself and and if I

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,570
thought that the price or your travel

00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:27,360
cost seemed unreasonable I did a quick

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:35,940
search on flight search engines to

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:37,649
verify if it's somewhat reasonable okay

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:44,789
have we had everybody who did it this

00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:49,909
year now so I guess I was biased towards

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:54,240
people doing sort of core infrastructure

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:56,220
stuff in addition to packaging or so I I

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,710
mean I do packaging but I wouldn't have

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,440
rank myself that highly for travel

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:05,309
sponsorship I was bias toward people who

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,320
are really sort of doing extra stuff and

00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,029
above and beyond whether that's

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,769
reasonable or not that's what I did and

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:16,919
for travel I found the two I was equally

00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:22,159
confused as go dance and but I really

00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:24,659
just looked at the requested amount

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,460
compared to the geographic location so I

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:31,010
didn't penalize people for being from

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:36,000
far away but again I had some similar

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:39,059
idea about I guess there was an

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,250
underlying thought that well if we can

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:46,020
pay for five people all else being equal

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,940
if we can pay for five people rather

00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,120
than one we should probably pay for a

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,639
five

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:59,370
the risk of I think it's within the

00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:01,320
agenda point so don't not the we're

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,480
talking here about criteria for

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,789
comparing individuals which is obviously

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,519
what you need to think about in the

00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:10,860
first instance but the point that's

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,259
being raised here is also valid of how

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,750
if you've got this comparison imagine

00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,789
you excite some perfectly accurate score

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,799
to each individual there is still a

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,110
question about how you actually decide

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,389
who to give the money to in the end in

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,570
most in I think every year all that's

00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:29,370
happened recently has be effectively has

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,960
been people counted down from the

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,710
highest-ranking person to the lowest

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,480
ranking which obviously avoids having to

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,970
think about something more complicated

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,620
but it's not necessarily the best way to

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,539
spend Debian's money to do that

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,519
if you imagine I mean you can easily

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:48,570
imagine things like person one cost the

00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,970
same as person two to eleven together or

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,309
as in the next person in the list and

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,049
person n costs the same as the next ten

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:58,019
would be and maybe it would be more

00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:59,909
useful to Debbie and overall to bring

00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:01,110
those ten people instead of one person

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,480
from very far away

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,500
obviously that gets into there's a lot

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,000
of different issues do they need to

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,389
start thinking about of fairness over

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,429
years and so on but I still think I do

00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:13,710
think it's wrong just to say well let's

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,830
just carry on blindly and only count

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:19,200
down the less and ignore this issue

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:22,590
there's also the bias that we enforce

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,990
over the years is that if we only if we

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,570
ranked by a contributor level then we

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,029
risk that we only reduce the set over

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,620
time and one good advantage of debconf

00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,269
was the newbies found last year for

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,639
example is just bring new people to the

00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:37,769
thing but get benefit from their comp

00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:40,529
just because you are not yet a core

00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:42,690
member and i mean on one ahead it's good

00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:45,149
to have core members here because it's

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,370
also good work done etc but it's we have

00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:51,480
also to put some ways into having new

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:55,019
contributors in i think right so if i

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,889
can sort of propose a slightly more

00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:02,509
formal way of looking at this it seems

00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:05,749
that we have essentially kind of

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:09,079
roughly three criteria for granting

00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:11,719
sponsorship the first is that the person

00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,759
is a worthwhile person to have at DEFCON

00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:16,099
for some reason or other and that's a

00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,449
thing that a lot of people have been

00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:19,369
talking about for example with newbies

00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:20,599
or core people or whatever and that's

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,749
the thing that we need talked about in

00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,639
more detail the second criterion is

00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:27,049
really nobody seems to be saying that

00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:29,089
everybody should be applying on ship

00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:38,029
there's obviously some criteria in our

00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:40,579
financial need right I I would like to

00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:43,699
propose that there that the criterion

00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:45,589
should be that essentially the person

00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:48,019
would not be able to attend debconf

00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:50,119
otherwise because the point of the

00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,399
exercise is to enable people to come to

00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:56,679
DEFCON not to subsidize people in

00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:58,549
general and the third criterion is

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,619
something a bit more Willie but it's

00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:03,739
that the travel cost the actual claim is

00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:07,819
reasonable that the travel cost they're

00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:10,639
claiming are roughly sensible and and

00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:17,299
they kind of fairly straightforward

00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:20,929
criteria I just to comment in one of

00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:23,629
your points I would not agree here so

00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:26,629
much on this the people that can come

00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:29,569
although otherwise it should not apply I

00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:33,889
mean some people are able to get lend

00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:35,979
money and get and make a commitment to

00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:39,079
get money they don't have access to

00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:43,039
which is which can be hard for people to

00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:46,190
do who would come but a part of the

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:49,279
sponsorship is making life less

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:53,509
miserable for them so yeah I mean I

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,119
think we I was just adding to the today

00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:59,539
Bobby document that we we should have

00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:01,759
other quantitative field asking what

00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,579
would be your action if it was denied to

00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:08,289
you so I will go anyway - I would

00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:08,289
definitely no go don't

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:18,160
yeah yeah so just to let you understand

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,020
what can happen I I will talk about my

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,890
specific case so I ask for travel

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,320
sponsorship

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:27,490
I've been denied as you can see I'm

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,950
still here I what happened is that I

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,660
asked my mother okay and it's going to

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,630
affect me for the rest of the year

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,220
it's not because I'm here then you

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,780
should haven't it was the right thing

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,720
not to sponsor me I believe cause like I

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:49,140
care about DPN and it affects my life

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,640
but I still want to come I think you're

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,500
still not disagreeing for that with the

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,130
idea that there should be some kind of

00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,590
need criteria and I didn't want to

00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:13,900
suggest that they show me a particular

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:17,230
specific criteria the question is I'm

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:21,010
just pumped in the discussion that we

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:25,980
had a past that conf about this the Nate

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:47,440
they did and the dart wrote these tops

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:49,450
too but some proposal how to approach is

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,180
there anyone here who really thinks we

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,640
should ignore for example I mean to have

00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,350
a hypothetical example should it be

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,790
should we be expecting that

00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,590
next time Mark Shuttleworth comes to

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,780
DEFCON with he would be perfectly valid

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,950
Lee applying for travel sponsorship if

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:09,970
he's doing something in Debian at the

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:12,610
time it's a big if so I think I the only

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,830
reason I would propose and and have

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,080
occasionally in private discussions

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,890
proposed not having a need criteria is

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,090
that it seems very difficult to have a

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,270
need criteria

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,370
we agree on an end to have one which is

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,830
applied consistently and I think that a

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,800
need criteria that is kind of fuzzy and

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:40,780
badly applied is maybe worse than not

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:43,510
having one just saying everyone that has

00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:47,440
to pay it out of their own pocket should

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:49,930
apply because that's I think that was

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,720
also year in your introduction that you

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,600
said today some apply and some don't and

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,850
I think that's not a fair situation so

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,710
as I said before and we agreed on the

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,990
same thing is it's in quite important to

00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,560
have this criteria for the people to

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,690
decide they should apply or not to make

00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,950
more fair the whole process and the

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,250
other thing I was going to propose

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:15,250
since there is to be this recurring

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,630
theme of people who are really big

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,130
contributors and really well-known

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,980
people on this these people who are

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:24,190
newbies may be a good way to solve this

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,840
is to have two separate budgets so had

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,700
this money for newbies and we paid with

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,690
a different criteria that for the people

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:33,480
who are big contributors think we all

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,830
agree on that

00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm not so sure if I can have an

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:44,170
opposite I'm not so sure because it's

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,620
quite easy to get involved into debian

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:51,430
without being present so I it could also

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:54,790
be an option to say people should be

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,650
involved first because it's possible to

00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:00,190
do that without coming to any conference

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:04,710
and if they show some interest then they

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:07,870
basically are getting sponsoring

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:10,060
something about criteria that it's a

00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,190
typical problem in in movie writing and

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,180
I como things so we just need a lot of

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,450
people ranking and the criterion became

00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:21,640
necessary I mean if we are all of the

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,620
Deaf contenders just ranking three or

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,120
four people this the cookie becames

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,920
well ii do think everyone should write

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,310
all the people to have consistent

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,310
ranking

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:45,400
well there's two things about that first

00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:47,620
movies you rank about some criteria

00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,050
still I mean is the actress beautiful

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,200
awesome and it's criterias that we know

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:55,930
in advance the other thing I just wanted

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,640
to just throw into the discussion I'm

00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:02,020
not yet convinced myself that it's a

00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:04,510
good idea but one obvious or objective

00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,970
measure that we could ask is what is

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,370
your annual income and what is the part

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,960
you are asking I mean that might be

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,520
considered that it's just a measure that

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,070
is somehow consistent across the

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,200
countries of the effort I mean is it a

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,150
month's worth of your income is it half

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,070
a month is it a day or the two three

00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,480
months and I mean that's that's a

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,690
measure of the effort you have to make

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,790
to come and I don't know I'm not sure

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:33,120
it's yet good a good idea but I'm just

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:37,420
throwing it to the discussion I think

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,180
this this would not we cannot give

00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,700
everybody a ranking right but having a

00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,340
beginning of committee as we have had

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,870
ensures that the criteria is at least

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:52,420
more a more distributed so I think

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,790
having ten people rank it should be

00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,610
enough in my opinion even if they have a

00:31:54,790 --> 00:32:02,590
some diversity some divergence in their

00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:05,410
opinions and well I don't think that

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:07,630
that idea is so crazy I think that

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,850
should come into account and not only

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:14,110
for travel sponsorship but also for

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:18,430
lodging and food I think it does make a

00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:21,190
difference and even more when when we

00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:25,000
are tight on money as we were this year

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:27,460
I think it's a fair thing to ask right

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,270
so I'm I'm very strongly opposed to this

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,770
notion that the that we'll just have you

00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,110
know ten people and they'll each bring

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,210
their own ideas the to the table and

00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,540
somehow the result will be fair that it

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,580
that it's not a way to get fair outcomes

00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,320
we if you let people make decisions in

00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,830
an unstructured way and you don't give

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,110
them formal guidance

00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:51,649
what you get is people's unexamined

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,360
prejudices and even when you've got good

00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:55,399
people who are trying their best those

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,559
kind of prejudices you know the

00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:00,049
structure doesn't provide you with the

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:02,899
assistance to overcome your prejudices

00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:06,230
and this is why we should have a system

00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:08,720
that requires the people making the

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:15,279
decision to go through a set of criteria

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:18,200
and think about them and make a decision

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,740
in a structured way that's not to say

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,330
that everybody has to agree it means

00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,990
that everybody has to think about the

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:31,159
same questions and think about things in

00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,470
the same way okay sorry I think we're

00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,429
running out of time for this topic if we

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:40,309
want to discuss others I think we can

00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:43,639
continue this in the bathroom or

00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:47,179
wherever if there's interest just to

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:49,070
finish this I would like you to ask a

00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:53,000
few questions raise your hands those

00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:55,760
that think we should or only minimal

00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,529
criteria should be neat and just

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:04,519
everyone should be able to apply but

00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:08,030
just just on this neat thing who thinks

00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,129
that mostly everyone should apply and it

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:25,790
should not be based on needs that much

00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:27,710
so we want to count and again I it just

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,780
made me think the thing is that if we

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:33,409
have everyone apply then we have a

00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:36,409
larger set so it makes it harder for the

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:38,060
rating team but it also makes it evenly

00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,760
distributed across the people that will

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:44,290
come in the end but that but in that

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,290
case we need more creepiest

00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:58,310
yeah I think if people apply and there's

00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,560
some expecting that they at least could

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,090
be grounded if there's money so put up

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,330
your hand if you think the travel

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:13,820
sponsorship should be granted regardless

00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:16,700
of financial need should be granted only

00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,470
to those with the financial need in you

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,600
have very valid points but you're also

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:27,080
talking over the buff moderator which I

00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:29,510
find personally distressing okay yeah

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:42,080
but can you raise your hand again so

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:47,300
David kind of count okay it was a bad

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:50,390
idea I think it's just I think my idea

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,700
was that this buff should not be only

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:56,330
about those talking a lot but also to

00:35:52,700 --> 00:36:10,580
gather a bit more quantitative opinions

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:13,760
how people actually think to just have

00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:16,790
are you more leaning to what we should

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,920
just grant those that actually very much

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,310
need it and couldn't come otherwise

00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,110
or should we grant also those that have

00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,210
to pay it out of their own pocket it

00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:29,030
probably affects them somehow

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:35,000
but they would come all the ways to I

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:37,220
think that's you know pinion might have

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,550
other opinions so that's what that's

00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:44,510
what I want to find out I think might be

00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:46,520
tricky to to phrase this into yes no

00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,230
question like just now because it seems

00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,540
that there is many shades in this

00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:55,340
there's many factors to consider so

00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:59,010
probably this kind of voting is a bit

00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:01,200
developing from the real goal of it is

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,090
not that if one person more leans on the

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,220
one side we just do it that way it's

00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:10,440
just to gather some view of the general

00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:15,599
what people think are you going to ask

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,250
about these four criteria there I was

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,320
thinking just about the two but because

00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:23,400
I think these two questions are okay

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,619
because this way the more there's not

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,940
only give it to all all you get to those

00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,070
are neat because there are different

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:33,390
needs okay I have another idea it was

00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:36,630
just a spontaneous study of these four

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:47,130
levels of needs where do you think we

00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:48,660
should draw the line I personally think

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,210
it would make maybe sense to have

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,550
different budgets to have one budget for

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,290
newbies one budget for this criteria

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,510
need and that for that criteria need

00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:06,690
that would split the money further but I

00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:08,460
think some I'm not involved in travel

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,320
sponsorship in any way but just

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,230
something I was thinking about why I'm

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,940
listening to what you're saying is at

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,070
the university there you know they have

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,869
scholarships and and there are two types

00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,089
of scholarships one of them is a

00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:24,660
merit-based scholarship it doesn't

00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:26,400
matter I you know if you poor or not it

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,190
just don't based on what you have done

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,349
so in terms of Debian there will be your

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,150
contribution and and the other one would

00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,849
be a need space so if you're poor and

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:38,550
you're much more likely to get it so and

00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:41,280
and the third thing I heard here is is

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,420
about the new base so what I'm thinking

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,550
is maybe there should be different slots

00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:50,130
you know we have so much money we can

00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,140
sponsor X people and then out of those X

00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,030
people two of them are going to be

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,950
newbies free of them are going to be

00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,829
needs-based and three of them are going

00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:06,789
to be

00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:09,160
that might be another idea when I mean I

00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:11,289
generally agree with this but one

00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,390
inconvenience we would have is that well

00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:15,339
we're heading towards a system where the

00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:19,930
number of Q's approaches the number of

00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:22,569
applicants and then people would well

00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,489
let's say the fight or the discussion

00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:27,130
would be to which queue are you saying

00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:29,319
are you to be assigned so yeah there are

00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,589
some criteria like newbies that's a

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,869
clearly easy to get but say if if I want

00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:36,759
to get sponsorship should I wait in the

00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:39,219
line for the disadvantaged countries or

00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:48,489
for the people contributing to their

00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:50,769
bein or to both go to the public or not

00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:55,089
public topic because we just have five

00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:57,700
minutes left I just say I think though I

00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:59,140
realize there are some privacy concerns

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,759
about exactly what you make public I

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,190
think it is a fair thing that if you are

00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:04,690
applying for money from Debian is

00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,249
you should have to accept as part of

00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,630
that that at least at the very least

00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:10,089
your name is gonna be made public

00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,769
because they're also just a void it

00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:14,259
takes away one level of problem by

00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,599
meaning that however whatever stupid

00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:18,249
criteria we end up coming up with even

00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,660
if they're really bad at least then

00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,150
other people in the project can look at

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,459
it and just make some opinion about

00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,140
whether they want to interfere or not if

00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:28,569
it's just a black box and they have no

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,749
idea it's not really a good way to spend

00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:33,640
double your money in my view I think

00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:35,949
although it's very important that it's

00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,509
clear to everyone if they apply what's

00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:43,509
gonna be public right I think we can't

00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:46,869
do it for this year's what I would like

00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:48,339
to suggest is that the application in

00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:51,130
terms the parts of the application which

00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:52,869
relate to why should I be sponsored in

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,469
terms of what am I going to do for

00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:59,410
Debian what what is my justification for

00:40:56,469 --> 00:41:02,140
having Debian's money that part that's

00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:05,529
not the financial side should be made

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:07,869
public and the I think it will be fine

00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,940
to ask people for their income but that

00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:10,630
should be kept private and the result

00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,979
should be

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,069
these are the applications that we

00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:21,789
accepted and you just you just get told

00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:23,710
this person was sponsored or not in the

00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:26,170
other way around could be useful for the

00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:29,019
applicant if the people who says the

00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,999
output public the output of the comments

00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,999
in the comment box I send an email like

00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:35,890
it know weeks ago asking for those boxes

00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:43,650
I mean I just

00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:46,539
anonymous ways to know what sorry I

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:49,920
think it's on one hand it's probably

00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:52,660
tricky two completely anonymous this and

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,029
it's also at least with the current

00:41:52,660 --> 00:42:01,450
system quite some work if you want to do

00:41:55,029 --> 00:42:03,160
this for everyone I think I mean yes

00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,589
there should be something said back to

00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,499
the person as to why they were accepted

00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:14,410
or rejected but I think it would open to

00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:17,380
lots of disagreements if in your

00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:20,079
comments somebody said something you

00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:27,609
don't hundred percent agree on then

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:30,190
there will be flames is that the team as

00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:34,140
a whole makes some statement for each

00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,140
person instead of trying to anonymize

00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:48,069
yeah I do these five people and actually

00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:51,009
there's not much to summarize at least

00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:54,210
currently because it's mostly writing on

00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:59,380
this scale and very few comments

00:42:54,210 --> 00:43:01,630
well James has on IRC that you're

00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,089
polishing names only

00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,400
he says he's fair enough polishing

00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:09,940
Debian sponsored this amount to do

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,880
certain this X amount to Wyatt and is

00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:16,479
not numeric is fine because the area

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,819
needs to be transparent my name asked

00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:21,670
for this amount isn't other combinations

00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:24,730
become a gray area so yeah I mean

00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:27,250
finding which combination to

00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:31,060
I somewhat disagree I think we it would

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:34,300
be fine to say and this person requested

00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,460
that amount why not I think it's the

00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,620
source of flames also because then

00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,250
people have access to the result without

00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,750
having access to the discussion and I

00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,700
mean we have a discussion in smoky rooms

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,160
for a reason because it's it's a man it

00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,760
involves a lot amount of private things

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,380
and the result is also still being made

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,680
from the private discussions we had so

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,750
it it's actually quite typical that the

00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,870
results are known but the discussion is

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:05,410
not in in many other contexts that I

00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:07,680
participate in so in scholarship

00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:10,390
deliberations in research grant

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,440
deliberations the results are almost

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:16,810
always public and so I I of course can

00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,900
respect whatever consensus people within

00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:21,910
Debian want but personally I agree with

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,220
God ants that I would also be willing to

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,580
have the amount of sponsorship published

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:31,840
if it was me and and and and I think

00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:34,630
that that information of amount although

00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,280
I agree it can be problematic I think it

00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,460
is somehow an important aspect of

00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,590
transparency - so maybe the privacy

00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,570
concerns are too much and we can't do it

00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:49,870
but I think it would be a good thing if

00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:55,330
we couldn't fight strongly on this point

00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:57,040
but I I do I think if people the main

00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,690
people wouldn't people wouldn't in my

00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,770
personal view the main major reason

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,540
people wouldn't want it publish it's

00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:03,700
just they kind of feel embarrassed about

00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,810
having had this money but if that's the

00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,110
case then I doesn't they should be

00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:16,210
applying in the first instance so so ok

00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:21,160
I'm sorry I proposed to following those

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:23,890
I would like to form a team - now of

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,600
people who are willing to define the

00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:32,210
process for next year and also executed

00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,640
so I like very much this executing

00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,390
so like this idea that it's not just the

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,360
same people who make the decisions

00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:44,810
though what we meant to finish that way

00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,430
but yeah I like Phil honza's idea that

00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:49,070
it's not just the same core of people

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:51,920
who actually do the voting so whenever

00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:54,470
they do that execution I yeah I don't

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,930
necessarily think that has to be the

00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:59,590
team that does the voting but I think

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:02,630
they have also to follow up to actually

00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,070
implement the process they invented so

00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:06,760
that we don't just end up with a

00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:09,050
proposed process and then in next appeal

00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,070
something completely else is going to

00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:15,530
implement it yeah and if you're

00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:18,140
interested we could after the discussion

00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:21,430
meet in front and decide if we want

00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,950
another meeting to have at that con for

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:27,140
YRC or whatever how to proceed so but I

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:30,830
thank you for the discussion Confucians

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,690
very nice words I'd like to say that it

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:35,710
would be really great if next year we

00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,710
